The House Majority Leader has refused to support more emergency relief for Americans, saying he hasn’t “felt the urgency” to take action. Luckily, America has a progressive champion who’ll help him feel it. A May 11 tweet from @ewarren reads, \"More than 80,000 people are dead, Senator. Is there a number that would make this more urgent for you?\" Warren\\'s tweet is in response to an article tweeted from @thehill, also on May 11, with the headline: \"McConnell said there isn\\'t need yet for fifth coronavirus relief bill: \\'I don\\'t think we have felt the urgency of acting immediately\\'\" [[URL REDACTED]] Source: Twitter Warren’s spirited defense of common sense and common decency drew one Twitter user to declare, “We need Elizabeth Warren as vice president.

       "       'When Democrats Turn Out Alex, In a dangerous polling shift, Democratic Representative Xochitl Torres Small \\\\-- one of our endorsed candidates \\\\-- has just had her race in New Mexico’s 2nd congressional district moved from “tilt Democrat” to “toss-up,” according to Inside Elections. In 2016, Representative Torres Small flipped the historically red district by fewer than 4,000 votes \\\\-- making history while helping Democrats take back the House. Since then, she has led with the mantra that “common sense solutions don’t come with a party label” \\\\-- and she’s now working to protect her seat and block the GOP’s full-fledged efforts to flip New Mexico red. But AP News has reported that Rep. Torres Small’s Trump-endorsed opponent, Yvette Herrell, had “one of the biggest fundraising quarters for a Republican congressional candidate in state history” after calling on Donald Trump and his Republican loyalists to campaign for her \\\\-- and state numbers show that Republican voter registration is outpacing Democrats in the district by more than twice the margin of victory in 2018. Democrats have warned us that this presidential election could be decided in the House if Donald Trump decides to contest election results and if voter turnout is low. Despite our Democratic House majority, Republicans hold a majority of state delegations in the House. We cannot afford to lose any Democratic seats \\\\-- that’s why we’re mobilizing to provide crucial support to Rep. Xochitl Torres Small’s campaign in the last stretch of the election. We’re aiming to raise $5,000 by TONIGHT to help Rep. Xochitl Torres Small overcome the GOP’s targeted smear ads against her, reach the voters she needs to win, and protect the Democratic House majority.

       "       \"We've done a lot here -- and we can do more together. Inslee Friend, Too many days mark tragic anniversaries. Today is one. Two years ago today, a gunman walked into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida and used a semi-automatic rifle to murder 17 people and wound 17 others. It remains one of the deadliest school shootings in the history of this country. And since then, Republicans in the Senate and President Donald Trump have done NOTHING to prevent more tragedies like it. But here in Washington state we are doing all we can to put an end to gun violence. This year I'm joining with Washington state's Attorney General Bob Ferguson to push for legislation that limits magazine capacity and bans the sale of assault weapons. Weapons of war do not belong on our streets and in our schools. We've made huge progress in the last few years to prevent gun violence -- but there's more we can do here. That's why I'm asking you to join me and the Washington Alliance for Gun Responsibility in calling on Washington state lawmakers to pass HB 2240/SB 6077, which limits high capacity magazines: Contact your legislator today and tell them to vote yes on these important bills to keep Washingtonians safe from gun violence today. CONTACT YOUR LEGISLATORS I'm proud of the work we've done in Washington state to reduce gun violence. Last year, we put a ban on ghost guns -- which are especially dangerous because they are made with 3-D printers and can go undetected by scanners. And in October, Seattle investigators removed a cache of firearms from a man believed to be a leader of the most violent extremist group in the country. They were able to do so thanks to the state's red flag law, passed by ballot initiative in 2016. But that's not enough: We need to pass HB 2240/SB 6077 and prohibit magazines that can carry more than 10 rounds of ammunition. This is a common sense measure that will save lives. We should be making it harder for those who want to inflict mass violence and destruction upon innocent people. And by limiting magazine capacity and banning assault weapons, we can work toward a day where no one in Washington state loses friends or family members to senseless gun violence. If you agree: Join me and the Washington Alliance for Gun Responsibility to tell Washington state lawmakers to pass HB 2240/SB 6077 and limit high capacity magazines on guns here to save lives.

       "       'Susan Wagle for Senate Alex -- We are in tough times. I hope you and your family are staying safe. All of us have a role to play right now by staying home as much as possible, practicing social distancing and taking care of each other. Because of this, I have paused my in person campaign activity. My campaign is focusing on online events and tele town halls to reach out to voters. Tough times call for tough leadership. Despite pressure, I kept the Kansas legislature open so that we could finish our work safely. Kansans need certainty, and we could not leave town without first passing a budget. My opponent, state Senator Barbara Bollier, criticized me for my actions and actually advocated on the Senate floor for us to end session and allow unelected administrative staff to make decisions. The recent actions of congressional Democrats shows why it is so important to keep this seat Republican and with it the Senate majority in GOP hands. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put forth a stimulus plan that our workers, small businesses and farmers desperately need. But Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer delayed and distracted to advance their radical agenda like implementing their Green New Deal, rigging elections to benefit them and giving more money to Planned Parenthood. Thankfully, President Trump and Senator McConnell hung tough and won the day. Imagine how bad the outcome would have been if the Republicans didn’t have the Senate majority. We need to protect the Senate majority in November. In order to do this, Republicans in Kansas need to make the tough choice of who best to beat Barbara Bollier. I serve with Barbara in the Kansas Senate. I have a record taking her on, debating her and winning. I will do it again in November. While campaigning is now different, it does not end. Now is not the time to hold fundraising events. As a result, we are short of our fundraising goal for the quarter. I’m asking you to help out by making a donation in the safest manner possible today. Please click on the donate button below and make a small donation to help us stay one track through these tough times. DONATE We will get through this together. Please join me in praying for those afflicted, the healthcare workers on the frontlines taking care of people and for our leaders to act with wisdom and common sense to protect us.

       "       'Susan Wagle for Senate Alex -- Kansas now has four confirmed cases of the Coronavirus in the Kansas City area. Sadly, one other person has died as a result of the virus. Please keep the family of the person who died, those suffering and the medical professionals treating them in your prayers. Governor Laura Kelly has declared a state of emergency which will allow the state to access more resources and better respond to the spread of the coronavirus. Below is a link to the CDC’s coronavirus page that provides you more information on how to deal with this growing crisis. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment hotline (866-534-3463) is open Monday to Friday from 8 AM to 5 PM to answer questions. ## CDC Coronavirus Site Symptoms may appear between 2 and 14 days from exposure. They include a fever, cough and shortness of breath. All of us play a key role in preventing the spread of this disease. We need to continue to use good judgment and common sense going forward. Now is a good time to travel less and stay home with loved ones. Also, please wash your hands, cough into your elbow, avoid touching your face and replace conventional greetings like handshakes by looking people in the eye when greeting them. If you think you have been exposed, please self-quarantine and contact you doctor. Kansans are resilient. We take care of each other. Now is not the time for panic. It is a time to come together with love and prayer. This email was sent to [[EMAIL_REDACTED]]. To stop receiving emails, click here. You can also keep up with Susan Wagle on Twitter or Facebook.
