       "array(['PARIS — Immediately upon unveiling its new cover — a depiction of Muhammad — the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo on Tuesday reignited the debate pitting free speech against religious sensitivities that has embroiled Europe since 12 people were killed during an attack on its Paris offices by Muslim extremists a week ago.\\\\nThe cover shows the bearded prophet shedding a tear and holding up a sign saying, “I am Charlie,” the rallying cry that has become synonymous with support of the newspaper and free expression. Above the cartoon on a green background is the headline “All is forgiven.”\\\\nWhile surviving staff members, at an emotional news conference, described their choice of cover as a show of forgiveness, most Muslims consider any depiction of their prophet to be blasphemous. Moreover, interpretations quickly swirled around the Internet that the cartoon also contained disguised crudity.\\\\nOne of Egypt’s highest Islamic authorities warned that the cartoon would exacerbate tensions between the secular West and observant Muslims, while death threats circulated online against staff members.\\\\nA preacher, Anjem Choudary, the former leader of a radical group that was banned in Britain, was quoted by a British newspaper, The Independent, as saying that the image was “an act of war” that would be punishable by death if judged in a Shariah court.\\\\nBeyond new threats — and the potential for more violence after a week in which both mosques and Jewish sites were attacked — the persistence of what many Muslims see as continuing provocations opened complaints about a double standard in European countries, whose bans on hate speech some see as seeming to stop short of forbidding ridicule of Islam.\\\\n“If freedom of expression can be sacrificed for criminalizing incitement and hatred, why not for insulting the Prophet of Allah?” Mr. Choudary wrote last week on Twitter on the same day as the massacre at Charlie Hebdo, during which the attackers indicated they were avenging Muhammad for the newspaper’s insults.\\\\nSupporters of the iconoclastic newspaper defended the cover as a fitting and defiant tribute to Charlie Hebdo’s slain cartoonists. “I have no worries about the cover,” the cartoonist who drew it, Renald Luzier, who uses the pen name Luz, told assembled reporters at the offices of the newspaper Libération, which the Charlie Hedbo staff has used since the attack. “We have confidence in people’s intelligence, and we have confidence in humor. The people who did this attack, they have no sense of humor.”\\\\n“I’m sorry we’ve drawn him yet again,” he added, “but the Muhammad we’ve drawn is a man who is crying.”\\\\nLaurent Léger, an investigative journalist with Charlie Hebdo, shrugged off the idea, circulating on social media, that the cartoon contained one or even two hidden renderings of male genitals. “People can see what they want to see, but a cartoon is a cartoon,” he said. “It is not a photograph.”\\\\nMuslim leaders as far away as Egypt condemned Charlie Hebdo, recalling threats received by a Danish newspaper in 2005 after it, too, published cartoons satirizing Muhammad.\\\\nElsa Ray, the spokeswoman of the Paris-based Collective Against Islamophobia in France, declined to react specifically to the new cartoon, but said that cartoons that lampooned Muhammad breached the limits of decency and insulted Muslims. “The freedom of expression may be guaranteed by the French Constitution, but there is a limit when it goes too far and turns into hatred, and stigmatization,” she said.\\\\nMoreover, she argued that the failure of French courts to clamp down on cartoons satirizing Muhammad was a double standard, given the robustness of action taken when cartoonists or artists insulted Jews, including Dieudonné M’bala M’bala, a comedian, who in 2013 came under the scrutiny of courts, which banned a series of his shows.\\\\nMr. M’bala M’bala has said it was a shame that a Jewish journalist had not been killed in the gas chambers. He has also come under fire for popularizing a gesture that strongly resembles a Nazi salute.\\\\nIn a statement on his Facebook page after Sunday’s enormous unity march in Paris, Mr. M’bala M’bala expressed his admiration for Amedy Coulibaly, the gunman behind the killings at a kosher supermarket. “As far as I am concerned, I feel I am Charlie Coulibaly,” he wrote, alluding to the “I am Charlie” rallying cry. The Paris prosecutor’s office said Monday it had opened an investigation to determine if Mr. M’bala M’bala should be charged with promoting terrorism.\\\\nMr. M’bala M’bala said he was being unfairly targeted.\\\\nFrench laws safeguard the freedom of speech, but there are many exceptions to the rule.\\\\nPrime Minister Manuel Valls told the National Assembly on Tuesday that “blasphemy” was not in French law and never would be. But he refused to draw any analogy between the satirists of Charlie Hebdo and Mr. M’bala M’bala.\\\\n“There is a fundamental difference,” he said.\\\\nSome cultural observers praised Charlie Hebdo for upholding Western values of liberal democracy, even at risk of violence. Flemming Rose, the former cultural editor of the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, whose 2005 publication of cartoons lampooning Muhammad — including one with his turban depicted as a lit fuse — drew violent recriminations that reverberated across the world, recalled that the publication of the cartoons resulted in a fatwa against him by a radical cleric, threats against the newspaper and one of its cartoonists, and attacks against Danish embassies in the Middle East.\\\\nMr. Rose said in an interview that Jyllands-Posten had decided not to publish the latest Charlie Hebdo caricature for fear the newspaper would be targeted again. Still, he said it was imperative that Western newspapers not surrender to Islamic radicals.\\\\n“We aren’t republishing the Charlie Hebdo cartoons because we are afraid,” he said. “But I know well that if you give in to intimidation, it works.”\\\\nHis comments reflect the debate that last’s week attacks have ignited in newsrooms and in the streets and cafes in Europe.\\\\nJérôme Fenoglio, the managing editor of Le Monde, said his paper had decided to publish the Charlie Hebdo cartoon on its cover because “it is an important document that we wanted to show to everybody.” The cartoon, Mr. Fenoglio said, “didn’t carry any insulting message.”\\\\n“We defend our right to be able to publish any cartoon, but never those which would be aggressive,” Mr. Fenoglio said. Though he said that some of Charlie Hebdo’s caricatures were “not funny” and could “uselessly” offend people, “each paper makes its own judgment.”\\\\n“Freedom of the press is an absolute right,” Mr. Fenoglio said, “but each paper has its own free will, and chooses what seems pertinent or not.”\\\\nSome American newspapers, including The New York Times, did not reproduce the Charlie Hedbo cartoons that mocked Islam. The Times called the decision an editorial judgment that reflected its standards for content that is deemed offensive and gratuitous.\\\\nThe decision drew criticism from some free-speech advocates who called it cowardly in the face of a terrorist attack, which the newspaper disputed.\\\\n“Actually, we have republished some of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, including a caricature of the head of ISIS, as well as some political cartoons,” Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, said in a statement. “We do not normally publish images or other material deliberately intended to offend religious sensibilities.”\\\\nThe Washington Post, which published a single previous Charlie Hebdo cartoon of Muhammad on its printed op-ed page last Thursday, republished the new cover on its website on Tuesday. Martin Baron, the newspaper’s executive editor, said the images did not violate its editorial standards.\\\\n“It has to be deliberately, pointedly, needlessly offensive,” Mr. Baron said.\\\\nMore publications have published or plan to reproduce Charlie Hebdo’s newest cover online. Three million copies of the newspaper will be published on Wednesday in 16 languages.\\\\nThe proliferation of the cartoons is heightening concern that the already precarious climate in Europe will worsen, with the possibility of more violence. Some newspapers that reproduced the cartoons in solidarity after last week’s attack have themselves been threatened or targeted already.\\\\nA Belgian newspaper, Le Soir, received an anonymous call Sunday from someone threatening that “it’s going to blow in your newsroom.”\\\\nThe same day, in Germany, stones and an incendiary object were thrown through the windows of the headquarters of a newspaper, Hamburger Morgenpost, damaging the archive but causing no injuries.\\\\nKhalil Charles, spokesman for the Muslim Association of Britain, said free speech had been allowed to defy common sense and had given way to insults. Referring to last week’s attacks, he added: “Muslims are appalled, like everyone, about what happened. But this is criminality that should not be attached to Islam, and the Prophet should not be attacked as a result.”',\n",
       "       'Republican governors across the nation are proposing tax increases — and backing off pledges to cut taxes — as they strike a decidedly un-Republican pose in the face of budget shortfalls and pent-up demands from constituents after years of budget cuts.\\\\n“My jaw dropped,” Assemblywoman Michele Fiore, a conservative Republican in Nevada, said after hearing Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican, propose a $1.1 billion tax increase for education this month. “Whether we kill it by five votes or 15 votes or 25 votes, we are going to kill it.”\\\\nAt least eight Republican governors have ventured into this once forbidden territory: There are proposals for raising the sales tax in Michigan, a tax on e-cigarettes in Utah, and gas taxes in South Carolina and South Dakota, to name a few. In Arizona, the new Republican governor has put off, in the face of a $1 billion budget shortfall, a campaign promise to eliminate the unpopular income tax there.\\\\n“It’s not based on partisanship; it’s based on common sense and good government,” said Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, a Republican who has urged voters to support a ballot measure that would raise $1.9 billion by increasing the sales tax and gas tax. “We’ve been underinvesting in Michigan for some time, so I view it as a way to, long term, save us resources.”\\\\nRepublican governors are now in office in 31 states — the highest number since 1998 — and they have certainly not stepped away from the party’s bedrock platform of smaller government and lower taxes. Indeed, some of the proposed tax increases, like one from the governor of South Carolina, are part of broader proposals that would result in net tax reductions, usually by cutting income taxes.\\\\nMany of these tax increases face tough sledding in Republican-controlled legislatures like Nevada’s. And a host of Republican governors are pushing for cuts or holding the line on taxes.\\\\nStill, the shift is striking, and it comes in the wake of problems that Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas, a Republican, suffered after pushing though sharp cuts in business and income taxes. Governor Brownback, who found himself in an unexpectedly tough race for re-election in part because of a budget deficit fueled by the tax cuts, recently called for raising cigarette and liquor taxes and slowing planned reductions in the income tax rate to help reduce the shortfall.\\\\nBy most accounts, the proposals emerging from state Republican lawmakers seem like acts of pragmatism rather than shifts in philosophy for the Republican Party. In Washington, Republicans, who control Congress, have made clear they will block a series of tax increases proposed by President Obama.\\\\nGrover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform and a driving force in pressing Republicans to sign no-tax pledges, said he was annoyed by some governors who were calling for tax increases, like Governor Sandoval, whom Mr. Norquist described as “really bad on taxes.” But these Republicans are the exception, he said.\\\\n“You can’t just look at governors these days,” Mr. Norquist said. “You’ve got to look at the legislatures. The legislature in North Carolina is much more pro-growth and anti-tax than the governor.”\\\\nThe financial picture for states has stabilized, with five straight years of revenue and spending increases. But when those numbers are adjusted for inflation and population growth, they are still far below their pre-recession peak. The National Association of State Budget Officers recently warned that revenue growth was not strong enough to both maintain basic services and meet the growing demand to spend more on such things as higher education and prisons.\\\\nAnd the recovery is uneven: In 20 states, revenues in the current fiscal year are lower than expected, according to a December survey by the association.\\\\n“As new governors and legislators begin the session, they’re realizing that money is tight — there’s not enough to go around even if you just want to do the basics, like increase K-through-12 spending and fully fund Medicaid,” said Scott D. Pattison, the association’s executive director. “I think what’s going to happen is that elected officials want to implement tax cuts, but they can’t do anything significant or dramatic because the growth is so limited.”\\\\nThe governors, including ones returning to office and some new ones, are responding in different ways to this unsteady ground.\\\\nIn South Dakota, Gov. Dennis Daugaard proposed an increase to the gas tax and several taxes and fees related to motor vehicles because highway funding is falling short. Gov. Gary R. Herbert of Utah has increased the tobacco tax, proposed extending it to e-cigarettes and said he was open to an increase in the gasoline tax.\\\\nGov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, a Republican, said she would allow the state to raise its gas tax, a move she had previously promised to veto, but only if the legislature cut the income tax by almost a third and reformed the State Transportation Department. And Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, a Republican elected last November, has moved away from his campaign pledge to eliminate the income tax, which provides about one-third of the state’s budget.\\\\n“It’s been a very sluggish recovery in Arizona,” said Dennis Hoffman, an economics professor at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. “A stalled-out real estate market. We have just not rebounded.”\\\\nIn Michigan, legislators had tried for years to fix a serious shortfall in spending on roads and bridges. The governor’s proposal involved increasing the gas tax, but the House — the more conservative of the two Republican chambers — blocked that idea and would agree only to a compromise subject to voter approval in May. It calls for an increase in both the gas tax, which would be dedicated to transportation needs, and the sales tax, which would fund education and local governments.\\\\nState Representative Todd Courser, a newly elected Tea Party Republican, said the increase was unwarranted. “It’s not $1.9 billion when you look at it. It’s billions and billions in perpetuity forever,” he said. “I certainly will be an outspoken voice opposing it.”\\\\nGovernor Snyder said in an interview that he had gotten some pushback, but that the plan had won a two-thirds vote of approval in both the House and the Senate. He noted that the popular vote would come in the spring, during prime pothole season.\\\\nThe state also had done some belt-tightening, he said, and taxpayers would get a dedicated funding source for road improvements. “What we’re doing is following some principles that our taxpayers wanted, I believe,” Governor Snyder said.\\\\nOn the other side of the ledger, Republican governors in Arkansas, Mississippi and Nebraska have proposed cutting taxes. There are also several states, like Illinois and Maryland, where Republican governors have not suggested tax increases despite serious budget shortfalls.\\\\nIn some cases, governors are proposing increases in the sales tax and other levies only to offset the cost of a larger goal: eliminating the personal income tax. In Maine, Gov. Paul R. LePage called for increasing the sales tax and subjecting more goods and services to taxation, but only to offset the cost of lowering the income tax and eliminating the estate tax.\\\\nThere is little evidence that cutting the income tax or other taxes creates jobs or attracts business, said Michael Leachman, the director of state fiscal research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy group. Of the states that cut their personal income taxes the most in the 1990s, three grew more slowly than the average and three — all energy states benefiting from a rise in gas prices — grew more quickly, according to a study by Mr. Leachman and his colleagues.\\\\nRepublicans say that these kind of tax reductions boost economic growth. But critics like Mr. Leachman argued that shifting from income tax to consumption-based tax does push the burden further down the income ladder, a sentiment echoed by Democratic lawmakers in Maine. “If there’s a tax cut, we think it should benefit the middle class, and from the numbers we’ve seen this disproportionately benefits the upper classes,” said Maine’s speaker of the House, Mark W. Eves, a Democrat. Under the LePage plan, low-income families would receive a credit ranging from $250 to $500 to help mitigate their increased burden.\\\\nGovernor Sandoval, in laying out his tax increase plan to the Nevada Legislature, said he expected it to face opposition, but argued that the state needed to do something to improve its education system. “What we must all agree on is that another generation of young Nevadans cannot move through our schools without more resources, choice and reform — and that we must modernize our revenue system,” he told lawmakers.\\\\nIf Republicans were distressed by Governor Sandoval’s speech, Democrats were nothing short of ecstatic. “I never thought I’d see the day when a Republican governor was proposing all the things we’ve been proposing for the last 20 years,” said State Senator Moises Denis, a Democrat from Las Vegas.',\n",
       "       'KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — He said he fell for “her ideas, her thoughts.” She said he made her forget she was overweight, and “feel beautiful.”\\\\nThey flirted awkwardly at a conference in Amman, Jordan, where they met in 2011. Then, in flurries of text messages over a few weeks, they discovered they both were interested in photography and astronomy and craved the Saudi rice dish kabsa. Their mobile phones both had the Backstreet Boys song with the lyrics: “I don’t care who you are/Where you’re from/Or what you did/As long as you love me.” They got engaged, exchanging rings and completing a contract to marry in an Islamic court.\\\\nBut theirs is a love unfulfilled. Dalia Shurrab, 32, lives here in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis, and Rashed Sameer Faddah, 35, in the West Bank city of Nablus. Romance is not among the humanitarian reasons for which Israel allows Palestinians to travel from here to there.\\\\nNow, the couple have started a Facebook campaign calling on President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority to “Deliver the Bride to the Groom.”\\\\n“I have the love of my life — he’s really warm and kind, he always tries to make me happy, he’s proud of me,” Ms. Shurrab said, blushing and giggling as she shared their story. “When we cannot achieve what we are dreaming of, it dies slowly inside of us.”\\\\nThe frustrated couple are among thousands of Palestinians who human rights groups say are suffering from the separation of the West Bank and Gaza, especially since the militant Islamist Hamas movement took control of the coastal strip in 2007. In a report last year, two Israeli groups, B’Tselem and HaMoked, documented dozens of cases in which Israel, which lies between the territories, prevented Palestinians from passing through for weddings, funerals or other needs.\\\\nIsraeli policies have “made daily life unbearable for families split between the two areas,” the report argued. International law enshrines “the right to family life,” it said, yet for many Palestinians, “the simplest matters — starting a family, living together with one’s spouse and children, and keeping in regular contact with the families of origins of both partners — can no longer be taken for granted.”\\\\nA spokeswoman for Israel’s coordinator of government activities in the territories said she could not discuss individual cases like that of Ms. Shurrab and Mr. Faddah. Regarding the general situation, the agency said in an email that “when Hamas — a terror organization — came to power in Gaza, a policy was enacted” allowing exit into Israel “only for humanitarian cases and under the procedure to prevent unauthorized permanent residence” of Gazans in the West Bank.\\\\nMs. Shurrab says she is focusing her appeals on Mr. Abbas, not Israel, because “he’s responsible for the Palestinian people.” She imagines that Palestinian officials could somehow intervene on her behalf since they coordinate with Israel on security issues.\\\\nNabil Abu Rudeineh, Mr. Abbas’s spokesman, did not return a text message. The president’s media department did not respond to an email inquiry.\\\\nXavier Abu Eid of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which Mr. Abbas also heads, said in an email that the couple was in “an awful situation that reflects the nightmare that thousands of Palestinian families have due to Israeli apartheid policies,” which “have been dramatically radicalized in the last few years.”\\\\nPalestinians seek a state combining Gaza and the West Bank, but a passage linking the two, promised in the Oslo Accords two decades ago, has not been established.\\\\nIn the early years after Israel captured the territories in the 1967 war, Palestinians moved freely between them. In 1991, during the first intifada, or Palestinian uprising, Israel began requiring individual exit permits from Gaza; they became rarer amid continuing violence.\\\\nAfter the second intifada started in 2000, Israel stopped updating its copy of the Palestinian population registry for Gazans who moved to the West Bank; the B’Tselem-HaMoked report says Israel itself estimates that more than 20,000 Gazans now live there without proper identification, which limits their movement and employment. Since 2009, the Israeli military has allowed relocation from Gaza to the West Bank only for immediate family members in specific categories, including orphans and elders needing care, but not lovebirds who yearn to marry.\\\\nAsmaa Zaghlul, a Gazan who has lived in Nablus since her 2003 wedding, said Ms. Shurrab should be careful what she wishes for. Without a West Bank ID card until 2011, Ms. Zaghlul said, she could not leave the city or get a job. She has returned to Gaza only once — not through Israel but through Jordan and Egypt — and regrets that her three children barely know their maternal grandparents and cousins.\\\\n“If she succeeds to come here and get married, she will have a very, very difficult life,” Ms. Zaghlul said. “Maybe she can’t see this now because she is in love, but if she got the rational thinking, I would advise her to leave the whole thing and stay with the family.”\\\\nThe romance between Ms. Shurrab, a social-media marketer, and Mr. Faddah, a technician at an electricity company, was certainly unconventional in a conservative society in which many marriages are arranged. But their families reluctantly supported the union, and in 2012 Mr. Faddah’s father accompanied him to Gaza to make the engagement formal.\\\\nMs. Shurrab said her parents had received more than 20 proposals from Gaza men, but they seemed to be after her salary, when she worked as a teacher, rather than her heart. Beyond love, she also imagines “my life in the West Bank will be easier than my life here in Gaza,” since the economic and security situations are better. The couple have picked a paint color, peach, for the bedroom they hope to share soon.\\\\nThough her requests to marry in Nablus have been denied, Ms. Shurrab was allowed to go to the West Bank last May for a business creativity competition. Mr. Faddah came to see her at a Jericho hotel, and she thought about sneaking away with him, but worried it would harm the others in her group.\\\\nSo they are left with text messages, the occasional love note carried by travelers from one place to the other, and sketchy Skype conversations dependent on Gaza’s intermittent electricity.\\\\n“What are you doing?” he asked when they connected one evening last week.\\\\n“I’m waiting for you,” she replied.\\\\nShe smiled when he told her he had white beans for lunch. She had white beans, too.\\\\nEvery day, Ms. Shurrab irons the lacy white gown and veil she had a seamstress make for $400 three years ago, because, she said, “I want to be ready and look like a princess with Rashed.”\\\\nShe savors photographs from their four days together in Gaza: They stood at the sea, ate ice cream in the street, and had a formal engagement party at which Mr. Faddah placed shiny gold jewelry on her neck, wrist and ears, the bridegroom’s traditional “shabka” gift to his betrothed.\\\\n“We kissed here,” she said, pointing to the doorway of the living room and giggling again. “After this moment, I felt like he belonged to me and he’s the only one I can live with for the rest of my life.”',\n",
       "       'The Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization were found liable on Monday by a jury in Manhattan for their role in knowingly supporting six terrorist attacks in Israel between 2002 and 2004 in which Americans were killed and injured.\\\\nThe damages are to be $655.5 million, under a special terrorism law that provides for tripling the $218.5 million awarded by the jury in Federal District Court.\\\\nThe verdict ended a decade-long legal battle to hold the Palestinian organizations responsible for the terrorist acts. While the decision was a huge victory for the dozens of plaintiffs, it could also serve to strengthen Israel’s claim that the supposedly more moderate Palestinian forces were directly linked to terrorism.\\\\nThe financial implications of the verdict for the defendants were not immediately clear.\\\\nThe Palestinian groups said in a statement that they intended to appeal the verdict, but did not address their willingness or capacity to pay. In at least two previous cases, in which judges entered default judgments against them for more than $100 million, the groups reached confidential settlements, court records show.\\\\nLawyers for the plaintiffs said that if the Palestinian groups refused to pay, they were confident that they would be able to seize the groups’ assets, both in the United States and abroad.\\\\nThe verdict came in the seventh week of a civil trial during which the jury heard emotional testimony from survivors of suicide bombings and other attacks in Jerusalem, in which a total of 33 people were killed and more than 450 were injured.\\\\n“Money is oxygen for terrorism,” Kent A. Yalowitz, a lawyer for the families, said in a closing argument on Thursday, adding that the antiterrorism law “hits those who send terrorists where it hurts them most: in the wallet.”\\\\nThe case was brought under the Anti-Terrorism Act, which allows American citizens who are victims of international terrorism to sue in the United States courts. The law was used in September by a Brooklyn jury to find Arab Bank liable for supporting terrorism by Hamas. Damages in that case, filed by about 300 victims of 24 terrorist attacks, are to be decided in a second trial, which has not yet been held.\\\\nIn the Palestinian case, the plaintiffs included 10 families, comprising about three dozen members, eight of whom were physically injured in the attacks while the others were left with deep psychological scars, testimony showed.\\\\nThe plaintiffs also included the estates of four victims who had been killed in the attacks, which occurred on the street and at a crowded bus stop, inside a bus, and in a cafeteria on the campus of Hebrew University.\\\\n“It was a terrible thing to see,” one plaintiff, Robert Coulter Sr., 78, testified as he described watching a news report about the cafeteria bombing and realizing his 36-year-old daughter, a New Yorker on a business trip, was one of the victims.\\\\n“They brought a body bag out on the TV station, right on it, and went right down to where she was laying and I knew it was a girl, had blond hair,” Mr. Coulter recalled. “I said, ‘Oh, my goodness, that’s Janis.’”\\\\nThe defense had argued that their clients had nothing to do with the attacks. Mark J. Rochon, a defense lawyer, told the jury on Thursday that he did not want “the bad guys, the killers, the people who did this to get away while the Palestinian Authority or the P.L.O. pay for something they did not do.”\\\\nHanan Ashrawi, a member of the P.L.O.’s executive committee who testified for the defense, told the jury, “We tried to prevent violence from all sides.”\\\\nBut citing testimony, payroll records and other documents, the plaintiffs showed that many of those involved in the planning and carrying out of the attacks had been employees of the Palestinian Authority, and that the authority had paid salaries to terrorists imprisoned in Israel and had made martyr payments to the families of suicide bombers.\\\\nThe Palestinian Authority and the P.L.O. said in a statement that they were “deeply disappointed” in the verdict, calling the lawsuit’s charges “baseless.”\\\\n“We will appeal this decision,” Dr. Mahmoud Khalifa, the Palestinian Authority’s deputy minister of information, said in the statement. “We are confident that we will prevail, as we have faith in the U.S. legal system and are certain about our common sense belief and our strong legal standing.”\\\\n“This case is just the latest attempt by hard-line antipeace factions in Israel to use and abuse the U.S. legal system to advance their narrow political and ideological agenda,” Dr. Khalifa added.\\\\nHe also called the decision “a tragic disservice to the millions of Palestinians who have invested in the democratic process and the rule of law in order to seek justice and redress their grievances.”\\\\nLawyers for the plaintiffs said they could seek orders to have the defendants’ bank accounts frozen and to require them to turn over real estate and other property. The judgments could also be taken to other countries, where the defendants do business or have assets, Mr. Yalowitz, one of the lawyers, said.\\\\n“Once you have a judgment, the P.A. and the P.L.O., if they don’t pay, are like any other deadbeat debtor,” he said.\\\\nThe Palestinian Authority, led by Mahmoud Abbas, had serious financial troubles even before Israel, as punishment for the Palestinians’ move in December to join the International Criminal Court, began withholding more than $100 million a month in tax revenue it collects on the Palestinians’ behalf.\\\\nNitsana Darshan-Leitner, another of the families’ lawyers, said the plaintiffs would also go after those taxes.\\\\n“And we are going to put pressure on those who are negotiating with them, with those who have relationships with them to make sure that the Palestinian Authority respects the American law, respects an American jury ruling, and pay their debt,” Ms. Darshan-Leitner said.\\\\n“Our goal is to get this judgment paid. We did this before. We are going to do it this time again.”',\n",
       "       'On Friday evening, Boris Nemtsov, a Russian opposition leader and former first deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin, went on a prominent Moscow radio station to exhort his fellow citizens to come out to protest President Vladimir Putin’s policies. There would be a rally on Sunday, a spring march, to demonstrate against the deepening economic crisis and Russia’s involvement in Ukraine. The most prominent Russian opposition leader, Aleksei Navalny, had been put in jail for 15 days, which just happened to be long enough to keep him from attending the rally. Nemtsov, who was older and, by now, less influential, had handed out leaflets in the metro and encouraged people to come anyway.\\\\nAfter the radio show, on which Nemtsov warned that too much power in the hands of one man would “end in catastrophe,” he met Anna Duritskaya, his girlfriend of three years — and, as the police would later pointedly note, a citizen of Ukraine. They had dinner and then headed home, strolling across Red Square and past the swirling domes of St. Basil’s Cathedral, adjacent to the Kremlin. Just before midnight, as they crossed the bridge toward the historic Moscow neighborhood where Nemtsov lived, a white car pulled up, and, according to investigators, someone inside fired seven or eight shots. Four of them hit Nemtsov in the head, heart, liver and stomach, killing him on the spot.\\\\nDuritskaya was unharmed and immediately taken in for questioning. Nemtsov, a big, broad man, was left on the pavement in the rain, his shirt yanked up to his chin.\\\\nOn Russian social media, liberal Moscow has struggled to wrap its head around something that seemed like it simply couldn’t happen, until it did. It had been years since Nemtsov, a rising star in Yeltsin-era politics, had been the standard-bearer of Western liberalism, and he could be a silly bon vivant. But he was deeply intelligent, witty, kind and ubiquitous. He seemed to genuinely be everyone’s friend; when I lived in Moscow as a journalist, he was always willing to jaw over endless glasses of cognac. And he was a powerful, vigorous critic of Vladimir Putin, assailing him in every possible medium, constantly publishing reports on topics like the president’s lavish lifestyle and the corruption behind the Sochi Olympics.\\\\nHow could such a prominent politician — a founder of the opposition Solidarity Party, a sitting member of the Yaroslavl city parliament — be gunned down so brazenly, within steps of the Kremlin? “We didn’t kill members of government,” Gleb Pavlovsky, an independent political consultant who used to work for Putin, told me over the phone. “It’s an absolutely new situation.” Olga Romanova, a prominent opposition activist and a close friend of Nemtsov, said, “There are more cameras in that spot than there are grains in a packet of grain.” When I called her last night, she had just come from the scene of the crime, where her friend still lay on the ground, surrounded by laughing policemen. “It’s the first time I’ve seen a very close person murdered, lying on the pavement,” she said. “It’s terrifying.”\\\\nPutin promptly called Nemtsov’s mother to offer his condolences and threw what seemed like the entire Ministry of Internal Affairs on the case. Yet we can be sure that the investigation will lead precisely nowhere. At most, some sad sap, the supposed trigger-puller, will be hauled in front of a judge, the scapegoat for someone far more powerful. More likely, the case will founder for years amid promises that everyone is working hard, and no one will be brought to justice at all. This has been the pattern for other high-profile killings, like those of the journalist Anna Politkovskaya and the whistle-blower Sergei Magnitsky.\\\\nAlready, the Kremlin is muddying the waters. Immediately after the shooting, Putin’s press secretary called the killing “a provocation.” This morning, he clarified that there was no political motive behind the murder. LifeNews, a publication with close ties to Russia’s security agencies, has suggested three possible theories that are under investigation: The killing might have been revenge for forcing Duritskaya to get an abortion; it might have had something to do with money Nemtsov was receiving from allies abroad; or it might have been an attempt to smear the Kremlin. By afternoon, the government’s Investigative Committee had issued a statement saying it believed Nemtsov may have been killed by someone from his own opposition movement who wanted to create a martyr. There was even a suggestion that the assassination was connected to the Charlie Hebdo killings.\\\\nEven if one of these theories were true, none of Moscow’s embattled liberals would be convinced. “I will never believe it,” Yevgenia Albats, editor of the liberal magazine New Times and an old friend of Nemtsov, told me. “This is not about some domestic affair. These were absolute professionals.” Ilya Yashin, a member of Nemtsov’s Solidarity Party, was of the same mind. “It’s totally obvious for me that it’s a political killing,” he said. “I don’t have the slightest doubt about that.” Maxim Katz, another opposition activist, claimed on Twitter that, any way you slice it, Putin is responsible: “If he ordered it, then he’s guilty as the orderer. And even if he didn’t, then [he is responsible] as the inciter of hatred, hysteria, and anger among the people.”\\\\nIt’s hard to argue with this last point. Putin’s aggressive foreign policy, his increasingly conservative domestic policy, his labeling the opposition a “fifth column” and “national traitors,” his state television whipping up a militant, nationalistic fervor — all of this creates a certain atmosphere. Putin, after all, has a history of playing with fire, only to have the flames get away from him. After years of the Kremlin tacitly supporting ultranationalist, neo-Nazi groups, the same skinheads staged a violent protest at the foot of the Kremlin walls in 2010 while riot police officers stood by and watched helplessly. Today, a rabid nationalism has swallowed up most of the country, and it is no longer clear that Putin can control it. “In this kind of atmosphere, everything is possible,” Pavlovsky told me. “This is a Weimar atmosphere. There are no longer any limits.”\\\\nUntil relatively recently, the risks opposition activists knew they were taking on were not generally thought to be life-threatening. The government was likely to hassle activists and make their lives uncomfortable, but mostly it just marginalized them, like the town fool. This began to change with the arrests of protesters in the summer of 2012. When Navalny was sentenced to five years in prison a year later, it came as a shock; this had never been done before. Even after the sentence was suspended, it seemed to be a warning to the opposition.\\\\nNemtsov’s assassination took that warning to its logical conclusion. Now, “we live in a different political reality,” tweeted Leonid Volkov, a prominent opposition activist. “The fact that they killed him is a message to frighten everyone, the brave and the not brave,” Yashin said. “That this is what happens to people who go against the government of our country.” Anatoly Chubais — who, like Nemtsov, served in the Yeltsin government, and who remains close to Putin — visited the site of the shooting this morning. “If, just a few days ago, people in our city are carrying signs that say ‘Let’s finish off the fifth column,’ and today they kill Nemtsov,” he said in a statement, referring to the Kremlin-sponsored anti-Maidan protest in Moscow last weekend, “what will happen tomorrow?” Or, as Albats put it, “Hunting season is open.”\\\\nNemtsov had been confiding to friends of late that he was growing frightened. This summer, he went to Israel to hide out for a few months, fearing arrest. He told Albats that he worried he wouldn’t be able to withstand a stint in a Russian penal colony. In the fall, he filed a police report because of threats he was receiving on social media. It didn’t seem to go anywhere. Recently, he even let his bravado slip in public, telling an interviewer two weeks ago that he was scared Putin would kill him.\\\\nAnd yet, he didn’t let up. According to Albats and Yashin, Nemtsov was working on a particularly incendiary report that he planned to call “Putin and Ukraine,” which would trace the stream of weaponry flowing from Russia to separatists in the Donbass. He was meeting with the families of Russian men who had died fighting with the separatists. He kept up his withering attacks on Facebook and Twitter. He kept traveling to Ukraine and meeting with president Petro Poroshenko, something that couldn’t have gone unnoticed by the Kremlin’s security agencies. And still, Nemtsov never hired a bodyguard. He walked home through Moscow late at night unprotected.\\\\nAnd he almost made it. His apartment building was visible from the bridge. “From his window, where he worked out in the mornings, you can see the place where he was killed,” Romanova told me. “For many years, he saw the place where they would kill him.”'],\n",
