We've done a lot here -- and we can do more together. Inslee Friend, Too many days mark tragic anniversaries. Today is one. Two years ago today, a gunman walked into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida and used a semi-automatic rifle to murder 17 people and wound 17 others. It remains one of the deadliest school shootings in the history of this country. And since then, Republicans in the Senate and President Donald Trump have done NOTHING to prevent more tragedies like it. But here in Washington state we are doing all we can to put an end to gun violence. This year I'm joining with Washington state's Attorney General Bob Ferguson to push for legislation that limits magazine capacity and bans the sale of assault weapons. Weapons of war do not belong on our streets and in our schools. We've made huge progress in the last few years to prevent gun violence -- but there's more we can do here. That's why I'm asking you to join me and the Washington Alliance for Gun Responsibility in calling on Washington state lawmakers to pass HB 2240/SB 6077, which limits high capacity magazines: Contact your legislator today and tell them to vote yes on these important bills to keep Washingtonians safe from gun violence today. CONTACT YOUR LEGISLATORS I'm proud of the work we've done in Washington state to reduce gun violence. Last year, we put a ban on ghost guns -- which are especially dangerous because they are made with 3-D printers and can go undetected by scanners. And in October, Seattle investigators removed a cache of firearms from a man believed to be a leader of the most violent extremist group in the country. They were able to do so thanks to the state's red flag law, passed by ballot initiative in 2016. But that's not enough: We need to pass HB 2240/SB 6077 and prohibit magazines that can carry more than 10 rounds of ammunition. This is a common sense measure that will save lives. We should be making it harder for those who want to inflict mass violence and destruction upon innocent people. And by limiting magazine capacity and banning assault weapons, we can work toward a day where no one in Washington state loses friends or family members to senseless gun violence. If you agree: Join me and the Washington Alliance for Gun Responsibility to tell Washington state lawmakers to pass HB 2240/SB 6077 and limit high capacity magazines on guns here to save lives.

Susan Wagle for Senate Alex -- It was announced over the weekend that Kansas has its first confirmed case of Coronavirus. Now is not a time for panic. It is a time for caution and common sense. We need to be vigilant in avoiding direct human contact as those with symptoms may not know they are infected. We need to make sure we wash our hands and avoid contact with our face. Here is a link to the CDC’s prevention recommendations. Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. If you think you have the virus, please self-quarantine and follow the CDC recommendations found here. Governor Kelly’s administration is doing a good job keeping the legislature briefed and managing this potential crisis. We stand ready to work with her to make sure the state’s response meets the demands needed. At the federal level, Vice President Mike Pence is doing an outstanding job managing the federal response and Congress acted quickly to provide the administration the resources they need. As former Chair of the Senate Public Health and Welfare Committee, I have confidence in our ability to deal with this virus and manage the challenges ahead. This is an issue, that despite political differences on other important issues, everyone in Kansas government stands united to work together on.

Susan Wagle for Senate Alex -- America is in crisis as we combat a global public health pandemic. We are now being required to stay home to slow the spread of the coronavirus. As a result, our workers are being laid off and our small businesses are literally being forced to close their doors. Through very difficult times, I led the Kansas legislature to stay open and quickly do the people’s business by passing a budget before adjourning early so our leaders were able to go home and stay safe. This is exactly the type of leadership needed in Washington to put an end to the insanity going on in Congress today. Our workers and small businesses need help now. If ever there was a time for Congress to drop the partisanship and act in the interest of the American people, this is it. The Senate Republicans put forth a plan that would provide immediate financial support to laid off workers, help small businesses stay open and keep people employed. It will also provide support for devastated industries we will need to get our economy back on track when this is over. The plan provides resources and support for hospitals and medical professionals who are the front lines combating this pandemic. What are the Democrats doing? Slowing down progress to force upon us parts of their radical Green New Deal. A Democratic operative once remarked, “Never let a good crisis go to waste.” Speaker Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer are taking this to a disgraceful ending by blocking the much-needed stimulus package.  We can’t let that happen. I’m deeply concerned about the massive debt we are saddling with our children. But in the short term, I’m more interested in slowing the spread of the coronavirus and getting our economy jump started. I also want to quickly reach a point where people can return to work while we protect those most vulnerable. In order to do this, we all need to do our part in this 15-day period. The least the Democrats in Congress can do is put aside their own self-interests and vote for American workers and small businesses. Join me in praying for our medical professionals and that wisdom and common sense will be restored to Congress. P.S.

Now is a time to use good judgement and practice common sense. Visit our website Friend, President Trump has declared a national emergency to address the coronavirus. Governor Justice has done the same in West Virginia. The U.S. Senate will be in session next week to do our part to address this growing public health crisis. My top priority is the health, safety and well-being of all West Virginians. Due to the evolving concerns over the coronavirus, I have asked my campaign to postpone all campaign related events in West Virginia that are scheduled for the next few weeks. I will also not be attending any political events during this time. I encourage all West Virginians to stay home as much as possible and remain safe. I look forward to returning to the campaign trail. In the meantime, my campaign will use other methods to reach out and talk to voters. For more about the virus go to the Center for Disease Control’s website. All of us play a key role in preventing the spread of this disease. Good practices include washing your hands, coughing into your elbow, avoid touching your face and replacing conventional greetings like handshakes by looking people in the eye when greeting them. Symptoms may appear between 2 and 14 days from exposure. They include a fever, cough and shortness of breath. If you feel like you have the virus, please contact your doctor and self-quarantine to protect others. West Virginia has a large elderly population which are the most at risk for developing complications from this virus. West Virginians are resilient. We take care of each other. Now is not the time for panic. It is a time to use good judgement, practice common sense and check in on family, friends and neighbors. Stay safe.

Help Fair and Square flip Texas Blue! We need this to change. NOW. We're going to get through the coronavirus outbreak together. If you are experiencing symptoms or are looking for more information, you can visit the website of the CDC or the Texas Department of Health. We are closely monitoring the situation and its effects on the people of Texas and our nation as we work together to keep our families and communities safe. Friends, We can’t emphasize this enough -- if Texas doesn’t implement a safe vote-by-mail system soon, millions of voters will be disenfranchised on November 3rd. This will be the most critical election day in Texas history. And the Texas GOP is well aware that they could lose. That’s why they are misinforming the public with debunked voter fraud conspiracies. That’s why they are ignoring our demand to protect voters during an unprecedented pandemic -- and threatening to prosecute voters who are afraid to risk their lives at the polls. We can’t let Republicans get away with this. We need to act fast and demand safe voting before it’s too late. Sign our petition to demand Texas expand vote-by-mail for ALL voters >>> November’s election is less than 5 months away. And Texas is on the verge of becoming the next outbreak hotspot -- with record-breaking cases and hospitalizations every day. This should be common sense, but Republicans don’t seem to care. People shouldn't have to choose between their right to vote and their health. Period. Sign On Now >>> Together, we will fight for our democracy and the right for every American to vote safely. Thank you for standing with us, Team Fair & Square Sign The Petition >>> Thanks for supporting Fair and Square PAC.

no one should have to pay rent during a pandemic Alex, A pandemic is bad enough, but now it’s put many Americans out of work—and rent is due. Fortunately, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D—MN) has proposed an elegant solution. Her bill, H.R. 6515, is titled the Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act. Introduced in April and cosponsored by the rest of the Squad as well as many renters’ organizations, H.R. 6515 would establish a national relief fund to pay landlords their rent, and mortgage banks their home payments. No one would have to return to work when it’s dangerous, or risk eviction. Can you chip in today and help us win so renters can get a fair shake from Congress during tough and unpredictable times? So what happened to it? The bill is being stonewalled by corporate Democrats in the House, led by House Speaker—and wealthy landlord—Nancy Pelosi. Her priorities are ridiculous, as well as offensive. Congress has found money for Trump’s surveillance, for militarized DHS thugs, for a bloated & fraudulent war budget, and for endless corporate bailouts—but not for renters during a pandemic and recession. Once I’m in Congress, we’ll join this bill as a cosponsor and make San Francisco’s voice on it a loud and clear “yes.” New voices are needed in Congress that represent working people, instead of corporations & banks. Can you make a donation today so we can turn the “Squad” into a Platoon? Ensuring that voters don’t go homeless during a catastrophe shouldn’t be a partisan or ideological issue. Like funding firefighters, it’s simple common sense. Thanks for standing with us on the right side of history. We’re proud to stand with you. Shahid Want to give now?

Team, I think we can all agree: dark money in politics corrupts and erodes our democratic system. As you read this, super PACs are stockpiling money to pour into races like mine with the explicit purpose of drowning out the voices of constituents and citizens in favor of large private interests. I’m so proud that my campaign is fueled by individuals chipping in what they can because they believe in our movement. Unlike our Republican counterparts who are saddling up with corporate super PACs to help them win Trump’s favor, I have not and will not accept a single dime of corporate PAC money. That’s why I’m excited to have earned the endorsement of End Citizens United, the foremost organization dedicated to getting dark money out of politics. When in Congress, I vow to be a fighter and champion for common sense campaign finance reform.

Pollsters, pundits and political leaders are predicting that the path to a House majority for either party will run squarely through our district. Furthermore, Rachel Bitecofer, an elections analyst, proclaimed this week that “Losing a slew of House races in the heart of the Republican Party’s economic and political powerhouse…” would signal a permanent end to the conservative hold of the White House. But this is more than just another high profile campaign, team. This is about creating a path forward for all Texans and their families.

To put it bluntly, just because this race isn’t leaning Republican anymore, it doesn’t mean we can’t still lose. Sri is facing millionaires and corrupt GOP interests in November. The fact that this race is a toss-up means that grassroots power can overcome dark corporate money, but it also means that the stakes are higher than ever. To us, this is our chance to create a path forward for all Houston families -- expanding access to health care, solving our current economic crisis, and bringing common sense solutions to Washington. That looks more possible than ever -- but only if we have you by our side, friend.

This is who our campaign is meant for, friend -- and leaders all over the country are recognizing just what this movement can accomplish. It’s made our historically safe-Republican district a toss-up. It has proven that the voters in this district are sick of political games, demanding accountability from an opponent who politicized the coronavirus, calling common sense safety measures “unAmerican” and refusing to enforce laws that are meant to keep us safe. And, most importantly, it has put the issues our families care about at the forefront. With you by our side, we can finally deliver on these issues and make progress on health care and our economy -- but first, we have to win this election.

Much is at stake, as the country is not in great shape. It’s vital that this election be transparent and fair, and that everyone who is legally entitled to vote in November can do so and do so safely." Donate to our GOTV Fund ➜ Hi Team, Sri emailed you yesterday about our new plan to Get Out the Vote this fall, as it looks increasingly likely that we will be continuing social distancing into the weeks leading up to November. We know voting in this year’s election will look different than it has in the past, so we need to make sure that we’re prepared to help voters cast their ballots, no matter the circumstances. The data is clear, team: If we achieve a record turn-out in TX-22 in 2020, this district WILL flip blue. Can you make a donation to our GOTV fund to help Sri and our team ensure that not even one voter sits this election out because they are afraid or don’t have the information to vote? >>> TX-22 has been named one of the top pick-up opportunities for Democrats in 2020. Last month we were named to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's prestigious Red to Blue list, and this month Cook Political Report singled our district out, proclaiming that Democrats “have a good chance” of winning this seat! Sri’s message is catching fire, team. Houston families are tired of political grandstanding and do-nothing representation. While our opponents compete in a race to the far right, Sri is focused on helping the community now and bringing common sense solutions that work for Texans to DC. We will win this election if we’re able to provide voters with the information they need to safely cast their ballots.

Team, We’re faced with an unprecedented health crisis and we’re using our campaign platform to get the word out about staying safe and following the CDC’s recommendations for social distancing by canceling all in-person events and moving our organizing efforts online. This is especially important in our district which is one of the most diverse in the country, with many multi-generational families living under the same roofs. Please be mindful in practicing social distancing, especially with your family elders. We’re monitoring things on a daily basis, and will be sure to share any critical updates with you. We also remain committed to the work we have ahead of us to win in November, including raising the resources to continue getting the word out about the important issues at stake in this race: affordable healthcare, lowering prescription drug prices, and protecting Medicaid and Social Security. Our decisive win in the primary shows we have the support and the votes to win this race and flip our district. Help us bring science and common sense back to Washington.

With the election coming up quickly, I want to reach out and ask if you can donate to a candidate for U.S. Congress that I have known and worked with for more than 15 years, Stephen Daniel. Dear friend, With the election coming up quickly, I want to reach out and ask if you can donate to a candidate for U.S. Congress that I have known and worked with for more than 15 years, Stephen Daniel. During our time working together, I have been consistently impressed by his integrity, hard work and commitment to helping others. From fighting for justice for his clients to serving as a steward for his community, Stephen is one of the best we have. Stephen is emblematic of the common sense that we need to restore in Washington. He approaches every problem with a level head and works to find the best solution for everyone, not himself. He follows his moral compass, not the whims of whatever is easiest. He never ceases to do right by his clients, his family or his friends, and that’s what makes him a good man. Stephen is running in Texas's 6th Congressional District. This is a district we can win this year and I need your help to get it on the radar of the folks in Washington. Beto O'Rourke barely lost the district during his run for Senate in 2018 and the explosive growth of our area has made it even more competitive. Please join me in supporting my colleague and friend Stephen with a donation to his campaign today. You can click this link to donate.

There are a lot of problems Congress can fix if we work together and use common sense. Friends and Neighbors, I am so excited to share our newest ad with you, explaining what inspired me to roll up my sleeves and run for school board. You can click here to watch it and, if you’re able, pitch in a few dollars to keep it on the air. Watch our ad » Now, I never planned to run for office. But Friend, when I saw my sons and their teachers sweating in 98 degree classrooms and the school board refusing to take action, I knew I had to do something. It’s just common sense -- if we want our children to be able to learn, we need to give them the best environment to do so. So I ran for school board and I won. Not only did we get the schools air conditioned, but we got all 6 of my campaign priorities accomplished. This story is important because too often, politicians come around asking for your vote for the wrong reasons. Serving on my local school board and the city council, I found that if you’re willing to roll up your sleeves and work together, you can actually get a lot done for people. This common-sense approach helped me in Jefferson City, where every bill I passed has had bipartisan support. And in Congress, you can trust that I will always work to find common ground on the issues that matter most to Missourians. We’re coming up on our end-of-month fundraising deadline in just a few short days, and we still need to raise $15,000 from our grassroots supporters online to keep our ad on the air and continue reaching voters. If you’re able, will you consider chipping in any amount now to help us meet this important fundraising goal?

Let me explain why I’m supporting Jill We hope you enjoy this longer note from Mayor Harold Dielmann, a lifelong Republican who was mayor of Creve Coeur, Missouri for 28 years, on why he supports Jill. If you don’t have time to read it all (that’s okay!), will you consider chipping in any amount to help Jill reach her most important fundraising deadline to date so she can win this TOSS-UP race? Donate now » Friend, Today, my friend Jill Schupp is taking a day of reflection to observe Yom Kippur, so I wanted to use the opportunity to reach out and explain why, as a lifelong Republican, I am supporting Jill this year in her race to represent Missouri’s Second District.  I served with Jill when I was Mayor of Creve Coeur, Missouri, and she was on the City Council. I have seen Jill in action firsthand, and when she wants to get something done, nothing can stand in her way. From my time working with Jill, I know that she is a consensus-builder and works well with other people, and this shows clearly in her record. In fact, every bill Jill has passed in the legislature has had bipartisan support. I know Jill can bring back common sense to our government and that she’ll work hard for real solutions to the challenges facing Missourians. Friend, believe me when I say that for Jill, it’s not about a political party, it’s about doing what’s best for people. That’s why I say Jill Schupp is a people candidate, not a party candidate. I’ve been a Republican all my life -- that’s 90 years. I am proud to support Jill in this election, but I know she has a tough fight ahead in these final weeks. She has a very important fundraising deadline coming up in just a few days, so I would appreciate it if you would consider chipping in to help her win this race so she can go to Washington and get things done for Missouri families.

Team Culp, Did you see Loren’s email this morning? I know you’re busy, so I’ll keep this brief: we have just a few hours left to hit our end-of-quarter goals, and I’m hoping you can help. Since joining Loren’s campaign, I’ve gotten to know him. And let me tell you, he is without a doubt the person Washington needs if we’re going to restore common sense to our state government. We’re in a big fight, but we can beat Jay Inslee if we all unite right now. Help us reach our goals by midnight, and send a message to Jay Inslee, by making a contribution now. Even if it’s just $1, every bit helps. Best, Chris Gergen Team Culp Begin forwarded message: From: Loren Culp <[[URL REDACTED]]> To: <[[EMAIL_REDACTED]]> Subject: ACTION REQUESTED: Chip in before midnight My friends, One major lesson I have learned over the course of my career - from the U.S. Army to my current role as a Police Chief - is proper planning prevents poor performance. When I launched our campaign for Governor, I knew it would be a challenge. I also knew if we approached this campaign strategically and built a base of enthusiastic supporters, we could beat Jay Inslee and restore common sense to Olympia. It’s a bold plan, but times like these require exactly that. Like many others, we’ve been forced to shift all of our activities online. And while that allows us the opportunity to connect with even more people, it also requires additional resources to fuel those efforts. That’s why I am reaching out: tonight at midnight is our first end-of-quarter deadline of 2020, and we want to show Jay Inslee and his friends in Olympia that we haven’t skipped a beat. Can you help us do that by chipping in $10, $25, $50 or more now? Every dollar raised will go toward spreading our vision to as many voters across the state as possible. Alex, I’ve been so appreciative of your past support, and I’m hoping I can count on you again today. Chip in now!

Alex, I was recently interviewed by Jason Rantz about the Capitol Hill Organized Protest zone in Seattle, and what I would do as Governor. As I said during the interview, we have leadership in Seattle and leadership in Olympia that doesn’t have a spine and doesn’t realize that there are people in there that have businesses and homes, and the good people of Seattle need to be protected. There needs to be law and order. As a conservative police chief, I believe in the right to peacefully assemble and protest. What I don’t believe in, however, is lawlessness and complicit government leadership. When I’m governor, I will shut down those who wish to bring anarchy to our cities by torching businesses, burning cars, and assaulting citizens. If you believe, like I do, that it’s time for the lawlessness to end, can I count on your support this month? We’re up against a huge deadline on the 30th, and I want to make sure we hit our goals. Together, we can win this campaign and bring common sense to Olympia. The establishment politicians there may not like me, but I’m running to deliver for the people of Washington, not them. Join my campaign and help us hit our end of quarter fundraising goals by clicking here now. Thank you, Loren facebook twitter * * * PAID FOR BY CULP FOR GOVERNOR (R) 2020 Unsubscribe

It is my great honor to work hard to earn your support in our bid to retake the Governor's office after 35 years of one-party control.

Good leaders listen, great leaders learn and take action. [[URL REDACTED]] Donate Today Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram Friend, I have been listening. I have been reading your emails, listening to your phone calls, and speaking with you at our virtual town halls. I have been listening to my friends and community members for the thirty years I have lived in this great district. I promise to continue listening to all sides, including those who disagree with me. Scott Fitzgerald does not listen. Just last week 34 faith leaders sent a letter to Fitzgerald praying that he examine his conscience and push for policies that keep us safe during this pandemic. By forcing WI to reopen without common-sense policies to keep our communities safe, Fitzgerald put us all in danger. The US just reached 3 million Coronavirus cases, Fitzgerald is certainly doing his part to keep those numbers on the rise. Voters, business owners, and religious leaders are begging him to listen, but he won’t. Maybe he’s frightened that Trump will criticize him. Maybe he just isn’t doing his research. Maybe he will do whatever it takes to win, even if it means more Wisconsinites die. This is unacceptable. Join me and let’s fight for common sense and conscientious solutions. Please, can you chip in $5, $10, or $20 to help me stop Scott Fitzgerald? As your congressman, I will listen to you. I will continue to learn from you. And I will lead with YOU.

Wow, is this seriously our President? [[URL REDACTED]] Donate Today Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram Friend, Over 120,000 American lives have been lost to the Coronavirus. The gravity of this grim milestone seems to be lost on our President. Like you, we’ve been watching Trump this last week and have been baffled. Whether it’s the weird tirades to empty seats at his Tulsa rally or the nonsensical twitter storms, it is clear that Trump does not care about our COVID crisis. As COVID cases climb across our country, Trump is moving to end testing. Let that sink in. The virus will not go away if we pretend it is over. Americans will not stop dying if we stop testing. Tom is fighting for enhanced testing capabilities. Tom supports science. Tom leads with a clear vision for reopening, which balances our economic interests with our health and well-being.

Friends, We email you a lot about how Alyse and our team are creating a movement for change here in Alaska, and asking you for the resources to help to build it. But today, we want you to hear from folks who have already invested in our campaign. We asked why they were inspired to give, and here are just a few of the responses. Philippe from Anchorage gave because he shares Alyse’s values and vision for our future: “I contribute to Ms. Galvin's campaign because she represents a common sense, people first drive in politics for the state. I have great admiration for her, I have seen first hand what a wonderful volunteer she was (we had children in the same school some years ago) and she is the kind of leader I want for our community. I trust that she will put Alaskans first in her policy and voting decisions because she is a true Alaskan.  We share the same values and the same vision for our community, now and for the future.” CONTRIBUTE Allison from Palmer says she contributed after connecting with Alyse in person: “I know that meeting her made such an impact. It is vitally important that people in rural areas have the opportunity to get to know her too. They deserve the chance for better health care, and a policy that will protect indigenous lands. To meet her is to trust her. Alyse is intelligent, kind, and authentic." CONTRIBUTE And Derek from Anchorage told us he stepped up because he appreciates Alyse’s pledge to refuse corporate PAC money: “I want to see less corporate money in politics. In order to do that, candidates need a viable alternative campaign funding source which means I need to step up to help out. If thousands others like me do the same, we might actually see politicians working for the people of the district they represent instead of the money interests that put them there.” CONTRIBUTE Today, we hope you’ll join Philippe, Allison, Derek, and supporters across the state by chipping in $5, $20, or whatever you can to power Alyse’s movement for change.

Team, We could list all of the terrible things that President Trump has done during this pandemic that have put millions of us at risk. The way he's been handling the response to the coronavirus is an affront to us all.

We HAVE to make sure Christy Smith wins and Trump doesn't get another cheerleader in Congress. This special election in just 2 weeks will send a critical message about Trump's handling of this crisis. Our last fundraising deadline before our special election is at midnight on Thursday.

Hi there, as you know all too well, we lost a national hero just weeks ago when Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. Now, Mitch McConnell and Trump are teaming up to rush a conservative Justice with starkly different judicial views than her predecessor into the highest court of the land. And they're doing that while Americans are already voting for the next president. That's not only unfair to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but also it undermines the power of our democracy. Will you join me in demanding the Senate let our next president decide upon Ruth Bader Ginsburg's replacement? Thanks for upholding our democracy! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hi there, I'm just quickly reaching out to let you know that there are only ten days until this election is over, and we're going to have to keep fighting up until the moment polls close. I'll tell you why: Republicans still outnumber Democrats in the district, and now radical right special interest groups are throwing their weight behind my opponent because she'll rubber stamp their out of touch policies. I know it's not going to be easy to keep this seat. But, that's all the more reason to fight tooth-and-nail until we win this race. We simply can't afford to let up. I know we can do this. But, I will need your help. Can you donate a few dollars today to help us continue our fight until Election Day?

In 2018, Harley defeated the 30-year incumbent Dana Rohrabacher in the very first political campaign of Harley's life.

There's a lot that happens every single day, so it can be easy to forget that the election is in one month. But, let's be clear: that's reallllly soon. And we're going to need to use every single one of these next 31 days to show Orange Countians that they need to vote for Harley Rouda. Can you help us do that by donating right now? With coronavirus continuing to spread and affecting even our highest officeholders, two things are more clear than ever: we have to follow science, and we've got to protect folks' healthcare. Those are two things Harley champions and his opponent seems to dismiss. Can you donate now to help us re-elect Harley?

Our end-of-month fundraising deadline is in just hours. With mail-in ballots being delivered in just over a month, hitting our goal this month will be a huge part of determining how many people we can reach with Harley's message before they return their ballots. Hitting our August fundraising goal is critical since all of Orange County will be able to vote by mail this year instead of going to packed polling places on Election Day. So, can you donate right now to our campaign? This election is one of the most competitive races in the entire country. Period. POLITICO has called our race a "toss-up" and Inside Elections thinks it's the most competitive race in Orange County. That means we have just over a month to convince enough Orange County voters to mail in their ballots for Harley -- and it won't necessarily be easy. That's why we really need you to donate to our campaign before midnight. Can you do that?

Happy Halloween! Today's supposed to be the spookiest day of the year, but you know as well as I do that this year has been full of spookiness. There may be fewer haunted houses and scary Halloween gatherings, but I think this year takes the cake (or the trick-or-treat loot!) for scariest one on record.

You know the type. You answer the phone, you say hello, you're waiting on the line, and then finally a monotone voice announces that the IRS is after you. It's extremely frustrating.

Hi there -- our end-of-quarter deadline is tonight at midnight -- and, in all honesty, hitting our goal is an essential step towards giving our grassroots campaign the momentum we need to keep this seat blue on Election Day. That's why I have to ask: can you donate to our campaign today? We know this race isn't going to be easy. It wasn't easy in 2018 when Harley became the first Democrat to win this seat ever. And it won't be easy today. Corporate special interest groups are flooding our race with Big Money, POLITICO has rated our race a toss-up, and Republicans make up the majority of our district. That's why donations from folks like you are so important. They help us reach the undecided voters in Orange County who could ultimately help determine who wins this race.

Hi there, It's hard to overstate just how important it was to hit our fundraising goal this quarter. With my opponent and me locked in a dead heat this close to Election Day, deadlines like this one really can sway the momentum of this race. And, because of you, we hit our goal and are in a good place to reach the undecided voters we need before Election Day. I'm reaching out to personally thank you.

Hi there. June is our second to last chance to post the kind of end of quarter numbers that will silence the NRCC once and for all. A new rating just showed that our race is the most competitive in all of Orange County. That's a sign to the NRCC that they should jump straight into our race and try everything they can to flip it red. Our best bet to fend off these attacks is to post record high end of quarter fundraising numbers. Will you help us do that by donating to our campaign today? I'm just going to say it bluntly: we need a huge fundraising showing this June. With the election just months away, hitting our target this end of quarter is non-negotiable.

Hey -- it's Alyssa, Harley's campaign manager. I'm reaching out because Harley's on his way to meet Michelle for their debate. However, it's unlikely she'll even turn up. We want to show Harley that, even though his opponent is refusing to engage, we still think he's doing the right thing by trying to facilitate a debate.

Some of you probably saw Harley and me questioning Postmaster General Louis DeJoy about the USPS on Monday -- and you probably also saw how flummoxed he was by some of our most basic questions. Our elected and appointed officials should know their jobs inside and out -- that's what taxpayers pay us for. As one of my neighboring members, I know Harley well. And, I know that when I question him about what's happening to small business owners in Costa Mesa or how climate change is affecting our Orange County beaches or how the district is handling the coronavirus response, he knows exactly what's going on. We need to keep leaders like that in the House. That's why I'm asking if you can donate to Harley's campaign today?

Hi there -- I just wanted to make sure you saw this note from our finance director, Nicole? Our opponent's campaign is driven by massive donations from Big Money. In fact, her average donation is more than 10 times what ours is. But, we're so proud that our campaign is funded by grassroots donors because that's an indication that Harley's only accountable to everyday folks like you. With our end of the month deadline in a couple of days, will you help us show our opponent that we have the support of everyday Orange Countians by donating to our campaign today? \---------- Forwarded message --------- We emailed you yesterday about how Harley's opponent is stockpiling her war chest.

November will bring critical elections at every level of government, including our election here in Orange County and a presidential election that will decide our country's future. While Americans across the country are sheltering-in-place and practicing social distancing, this election could call upon Americans to put their health on the line in order to choose who will represent them in office. Every American should be able to vote without worrying about contracting or spreading coronavirus. That's why I'm pushing for vote by mail for all voters. Will you join me? States that have enacted vote by mail policies have seen large increases in voter turnout, and the more people we have weighing in on who will represent us, the stronger our democracy will be.

Today, Harley's heading to Newport Beach to debate Michelle Steel -- if she decides to actually show up. Fair debates are routine parts of political campaigns. They're also one of the best ways for folks to learn about the people they're voting for. So, it just leaves us questioning why Michelle Steel is so adamantly and blatantly against a fair debate. We need transparent leaders who will show Orange Countians what they stand for and care about.

Hi there -- I just wanted to reach out to let you know that our end-of-quarter fundraising deadline is tomorrow, and we need your help if we're going to reach our goal. The truth is: this is the most important fundraising deadline we've had yet in this campaign.

Today, Donald Trump and Joe Biden were set to answer the American People's questions about their presidencies in a nationally televised town hall -- that is, until, Donald Trump decided he wouldn't do it virtually. And, like Donald Trump, our opponent has also refused to participate in debates with Harley. But, the thing is, these debates are where undecided voters learn about the candidates. It's where the American People get to see who aligns with their values and who they want to lead them. Refusing to debate robs voters of that chance.

Hi Friend, Above all else, I want to check in on you and your loved ones. I hope that you all are staying safe and healthy during this difficult time.

Hi there, I'm just following up on Nicole's email from the other day about Michelle Steel giving her campaign $1.7 million dollars. Turns out, she's not the only deep-pocketed donor funding her campaign. We just learned that the NRA, the anti-choice Susan B.

And, because I'm not taking a dime from corporate Super PACs, I'm counting on grassroots donors just like you to donate to our campaign. Can you do that? Thank you so much! \-- Harley \---------- Forwarded message --------- Hey there! It's Nicole, Harley's finance director. With only 19 days until the election, you can bet that I'm keeping my eye on how many small dollar donations we're bringing in and how many big checks our opponent is raking in. So, when I got the FEC notification just minutes ago that Michelle Steel's Q3 numbers were in and saw that she's given herself 1.7 million dollars over the course of this campaign, you can imagine just how motivated I became to show her that we can still beat her with our small dollar donors. But, that's why I've got to ask you: can you pitch in just a few dollars to our campaign right now? Yeah -- you read that right. She's given herself 1.7 million dollars. So, I really mean it when I say that we need every single one of you to pitch in something to help us meet a massive haul like that. Can you help us get there by donating today?

I just saw an absolutely revolting story: that Donald Trump and Dana Rohrabacher conspired to offer Julian Asange a pardon if he said that Russia was not involved in leaking Democratic party emails.

Yesterday, Harley sent out an email to thank you for donating to our local Orange County nonprofits and in the hopes of raising even more money for the organizations. Once again, you all delivered -- and Harley couldn't be more excited. I can tell you firsthand that Harley's been consumed by making sure Orange Countians are protected from coronavirus and its societal side effects. So, it was great to chat with him about our deep appreciation of your generous donations yesterday. He truly admires the way all of you look out for your fellow Orange Countians. I, for one, am proud to be tasked with making sure Harley is re-elected come November because I know that when times are tough, he will go the extra mile to protect his constituents. Better yet, he'll do it with excitement, tenacity, and humility. Will you help us make sure that he's still in Washington to do that by donating to our campaign today? Thank you so much, \-- Alyssa \---------- Forwarded message --------- Hi, A few weeks ago, I asked if you would consider donating to some of our local Orange County organizations that are doing their part to help fight the effects of the coronavirus.

With your donations, we can put food on the table for our recently unemployed Orange Countians. We can support our valiant health care workers who are risking their lives to protect ours. We can help our small businesses who are facing bankruptcy due to closures. As we face another week of sheltering-in-place and as we anticipate more coronavirus cases, I'm asking if you will once again consider donating to these charities? If we step up and help each other now, we will get through this health crisis quicker and find ourselves more connected once it's over. Can you donate today to help our local organizations? Stay safe, \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Like so many of you, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death left me stunned and deeply saddened. She was a force of a justice and a woman -- someone who was relentless in her pursuit of justice and grounded by her sense of right. She led a life striving towards making our country a better and fairer place up until her last breath. Her death also left me scared. Scared because I know that this administration will choose short-term political gain over precedent, political process, and a sense of right. And that decision could alter our lives and freedoms for generations. Ruth Bader Ginsburg lived her entire life in search of the good -- for all Americans. Now, it's our time to continue her path and make this election a referendum on what's right. That's why I'm encouraging you: vote, vote, vote. This is your opportunity to make your voice heard. If you need convincing, just look at how much has happened in these past four years. And, if you can, sign up to volunteer! Yes, we would love for you to volunteer for our campaign (and you can do so here!), but if you can't volunteer for us, volunteer for another campaign. Ruth Bader Ginsburg irreversibly changed our country. The opinions she wrote will impact our grandchildren's grandchildren. But, we too have the chance to direct our country's future for generations -- just as she did. That's why I'm begging you not to give up this opportunity. Please do whatever you can to make our country a better place before November 3rd. None of us wants to wake up on November 4th and regret not doing more. You really can make a difference, and together, we will get it done. Thank you! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

We've tried to set up a debate between Harley and Michelle several times. We've emailed her, we've mailed her a letter, we've even used social media to try to get in touch. She still has not responded. It's clear that she's not interested in a debate, but we're still so curious why... Our elected officials are expected to speak in public and share their ideas with the people -- why the hesitation on her part? We're trying one more tactic. We're making a petition calling on her to join a debate today. Will you add your name today? With critical questions facing our country each and every day, we need leaders who are willing to fight for their opinions and policy positions. That's expected of our members of Congress, and that's what Michelle Steel should do as a candidate for Congress. Will you sign on to our petition to request she agrees to a fair debate?

We're living through a pivotal period in history that has the potential to transform our nation. We need leaders who we can trust to guide us through this turning point. Michelle Steel has put the lives of Orange Countians at risk time and time again. She's implied that wearing masks is hazardous to human lives (despite medical evidence), she's called for repealing the Affordable Care Act, and she's stood with Trump through every one of his hateful remarks. Harley, on the other hand, has connected healthcare workers with the protective gear they need, is voting today to strengthen and broaden the ACA, and is standing for human rights each and every day. The choice is obvious in our mind. Will you donate today if you agree that we need at least two more years of Harley? Our quarter ends tomorrow, so this is our last chance to show Michelle Steel and her deep-pocketed allies that our grassroots team is not backing down. We're ready to stand for what's right and make sure Harley has two more years in the House. Can you help us do that by donating today?

We emailed you yesterday about how Harley's opponent is stockpiling her war chest. Well, we crunched the numbers and found that the average donation amount to her campaign is over 10 times what ours is. We're proud of that because it means that our campaign is fueled by everyday folks like you. Because our campaign is truly grassroots, we depend on small donations. Can you donate $10 to our campaign today? Our campaign is about serving everyday Orange Countians -- not deep-pocketed special interests. Will you help us send a message to Harley's opponent that our grassroots strength is strong enough to match their war chest by donating today?

Early ballots for Harley's March election are already here, which is a really big deal because this election is the first chance to show how much Harley's constituents approve of his performance in office. Here's the bad news: The NRCC is funneling money into Harley's challengers' campaigns, and one of Harley's competitors is even writing herself checks for half a million dollars. But, the good news is that we know we have a vast network of grassroots supporters who are willing to show Harley just how much they back his performance. Will you donate now and turn in your ballot today to make sure we blow Harley's competitors out of the water in March? We have less than one month until the election, so every bit of support matters a lot. Let's show Harley's challengers that he's going to stay right where he belongs: in Congress fighting for all of us. Will you turn in your ballot and donate to our campaign today?

Hi there. I'm just reaching out to thank you for helping us reach our internal mid-month fundraising goal. With our quarter ending in just two weeks, hitting this goal was the first step towards reaching our quarter goal, and meeting our quarter goal will go a long way towards showing just how much enthusiasm there is for this campaign before the election.

Did you see Katie Porter's email about Harley yesterday? Check it out below! Katie and Harley teamed up to make sure Postmaster General DeJoy was up to the job -- and he didn't even know some of the most basic elements of the USPS. If anyone knows how to ask tough questions, it's Katie Porter. And, the truth is, Harley will always be ready for the hard questions. As a member of Congress, it's exactly what he expects. But, he's also in one of the toughest re-election races in the entire country, which is why he really needs your help. Can you chip in a few dollars to keep him in Congress? Thank you! \-- Alyssa, Campaign Manager \---------- Forwarded message --------- Some of you probably saw Harley and me questioning Postmaster General Louis DeJoy about the USPS on Monday -- and you probably also saw how flummoxed he was by some of our most basic questions. Our elected and appointed officials should know their jobs inside and out -- that's what taxpayers pay us for. As one of my neighboring members, I know Harley well. And, I know that when I question him about what's happening to small business owners in Costa Mesa or how climate change is affecting our Orange County beaches or how the district is handling the coronavirus response, he knows exactly what's going on. We need to keep leaders like that in the House. That's why I'm asking if you can donate to Harley's campaign today? We're less than 70 days from Election Day, and Harley is in one of the most competitive races in the entire country. That's why I have to ask if you'll help Harley hit his end-of-month fundraising goal before Monday. Can you donate today?

Hey -- I just wanted to make sure you saw Harley's email from earlier today. Republicans are set on taking this seat back from Harley. The Congressional Leadership Fund is spending dollar after dollar on ads that are just not true. Reince Preibus just donated $1,000 to our opponent. And, on the whole, the Republican Party and the NRCC are pouring more money into our opponent's campaign than any other challenger this cycle. So, I've really got to ask: can you help us protect this seat from the Republican Party by donating today? Thank you! \-- Alyssa Napuri, Campaign Manager \---------- Forwarded message --------- Look, they've crossed the line. This entire election cycle, my opponent has been backed by the full force of the Republican Party. She's a Trump advisor. She's been endorsed by Newt Gingrich and Republican House Leadership. And she’s received more money from the Republican Party and NRCC than any other Republican challenger this cycle. Now, they’ve gone too far. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, has been airing blatant lies about my tax returns. Let me be clear: Unlike our President, I have always paid my fair share of taxes. I need your help getting this message out to voters. Can you donate to our campaign right now to make sure Republicans don’t win this election because of their lying television ads? My campaign is funded by donations from everyday folks like you -- and that's because I refuse to bow down to corporate interests or super PACs when I’m in Congress. But that means that when my opponent starts funneling money into spreading lies about me just two weeks from Election Day, I rely on you to fight back.

Hi there -- it's Kaira, Harley's wife. I'm just reaching out to see how your Halloween is going and tell you a little about ours. This Halloween is a bit different than years past: our kids are grown, trick-or-treaters will be sparse, and Harley's election is in just three days. But, truthfully, it feels like a scarier Halloween than any I ever remember having. There are so many things at stake for this election, both in CA-48 and across the country, and truthfully I feel scared of what will happen if people like Harley's opponent are elected. So, this Halloween, I hope you can enjoy the holiday's spookiness and also help us end the real spookiness on November 3rd by donating to Harley's campaign. Can you do that? I've seen Harley's opponent put people's lives on the line during this coronavirus crisis, and it's honestly terrifying. She's supposed to be leading our county as our top official, yet she's going to maskless events and began this pandemic implying masks could be dangerous. It's hard seeing Harley with those same fears for our district and knowing that there's a real possibility his opponent could unseat him and take her policies and beliefs to the Capitol. I want to make sure that doesn't happen. Can you help me by donating to Harley's campaign today?

Hi! It's Nicole, Harley's finance director. I'm just emailing you because we need your help if we're going to hit our end of the month fundraising goal. With the election only months away, we're extremely aware that not only are we running in one of the most competitive districts in California, but we're running against one of the most well-funded campaigns in the country. That's why your help goes such a long way. Your support can help us show that we're keeping this seat blue. Can you donate today? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Harley is the only Democrat who has ever held this seat -- and he's been one of the most legislatively productive freshman members since taking office.

1\. I'm so proud of how my team has stepped up to serve our community in this crisis. We've used this campaign's resources to collect PPE for frontline workers in Orange County and raise tens of thousands of dollars for groups doing crucial work. 2\. Even while doing all of that, we're still running a very strong re-election campaign in a very tough district. In fact, before our win in 2018, a Democrat had never won CA-48! 3\. These last few months have made it so painfully clear that we need leaders in office who will put the needs of the communities they represent above political interests. That's why I need to ask for your support before tonight's make-or-break deadline for my campaign >>> If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Express Donate: $10 >>> Express Donate: $25 >>> Express Donate: $50 >>> Express Donate: $100 >>> Or, donate another amount >>> Thanks! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hi! Harley's field team here. We wanted to follow up on Harley's email (forwarded below) to see if you can help make some calls for Christy? What we do between now and Tuesday could decide whether Christy wins or loses this election. Every single conversation with a potential voter matters. That's why we're asking if you'll consider signing up to volunteer for Christy's team today? The Republicans are gunning for this seat, and they're giving everything to show their strength before November. That makes it even more important that we share Christy's message with CA-25 voters and let them know that it's more important than ever to hold on to this seat. Will you sign up to volunteer with Christy Smith's team? Thank you! \-- Harley's Field Team \---------- Forwarded message --------- To our north in CA-25, Christy Smith is in a neck and neck race against a Trump enthusiast who's cozy with Big Money. The election will be decided this Tuesday. This seat was firmly red for over two decades before Democrats flipped it as part of the Blue Wave in 2018. Now, the Republican party and its Big Money allies are pouring money into ads in the district to try to take the seat back. Christy really needs our help. Will you donate today to show the Republicans that this seat is staying blue? Flipping CA-25 was part of the historic Blue Wave that flipped seven Republican stronghold seats across California, including my seat. I know that the NRCC is aching to take back these seats, so it's all the more important that we send them the message that we're here to stay. Will you help me send that message by donating to Christy today? Thank you! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Our campaign is dependent on everyday folks chipping in small amounts to our campaign -- it's what makes Harley untethered to Big Money and lobbyists and able to serve the interest of Orange Countians. And $5 is enough to make a huge difference in this election. Can you donate that? Take Rhett Buckley. Even after losing a campus job due to COVID-19, Rhett opened his wallet and gave us $5 -- it's stories like Rhett's that make us so proud to be part of a grassroots campaign. Check it out ⬇️ Shunning Big Money means that Harley can do what he knows is best for hardworking folks in the district without worrying about whether lobbyists will like it. But, it also means that each of us has to chip in just a little bit to help him compete with his deep-pocketed opponent. Can you join Rhett and donate $5 today?

Hey there -- I just wanted to see if you saw Alyssa's email from yesterday (forwarded below). I've been asking my opponent to join me for a debate for weeks now, and she hasn't said anything about it. Debates are a critical way for voters to see where candidates stand on issues and how they differ from each other. And debates don't end with the campaign -- they're a major part of my duties on Capitol Hill. That's why I'm shocked that my opponent won't even acknowledge our request -- and we can be pretty sure that she's gotten the message. Can you join me in calling on Michelle to join us for a debate? Thank you! \-- Harley \---------- Forwarded message --------- Harley's asked his opponent for a debate. In several different ways. And multiple times. Her campaign still hasn't said a thing about it. We sent another letter to her team today letting them know that Harley's going to be available on August 30th at 6pm in Newport Beach for a debate -- whether or not she decides to actually come debate him. This is where we need your help: will you sign on to our petition to urge Michelle to show up for the debate? Our elected officials are expected to debate. That's just part of the job description and why it's so surprising that in the midst of many crises and with fewer than 75 days until the election, she's remaining completely silent. Will you sign our petition to demand that Michelle agree to a debate? Thanks for signing on! \-- Alyssa, Campaign Manager Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hi there -- I'm reaching out a few hours before our critical end-of-quarter deadline to let you know why your donation right now will go such a long way. We're in one of the most competitive districts in the entire country. In fact, our 2018 underdog victory was the first win by a Democrat in the district ever, and there are more Republicans in this district than Democrats. It only makes sense that POLITICO calls our race a "toss-up," and Inside Elections has named it the most competitive in Orange County. We're also in one of the most crucial times of the campaign. Voters will receive their mail-in ballots in just days, so now is our chance to share my message with undecided voters. And the consequences of this race will reverberate throughout Orange County. My opponent is threatening the ACA, women's rights, LGBTQ equality, and gun control. So, when I say that your donation right now is really important, I mean it. Can you donate today? I really appreciate your support! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hi, A few weeks ago, I asked if you would consider donating to some of our local Orange County organizations that are doing their part to help fight the effects of the coronavirus. You answered with unmistakable force, allowing us to collectively donate almost $15,000 to our local charities. With your donations, we can put food on the table for our recently unemployed Orange Countians. We can support our valiant health care workers who are risking their lives to protect ours. We can help our small businesses who are facing bankruptcy due to closures. As we face another week of sheltering-in-place and as we anticipate more coronavirus cases, I'm asking if you will once again consider donating to these charities? If we step up and help each other now, we will get through this health crisis quicker and find ourselves more connected once it's over. Can you donate today to help our local organizations?

Hey there! It's Nicole, Harley's finance director. With only 19 days until the election, you can bet that I'm keeping my eye on how many small dollar donations we're bringing in and how many big checks our opponent is raking in. So, when I got the FEC notification just minutes ago that Michelle Steel's Q3 numbers were in and saw that she's given herself 1.7 million dollars over the course of this campaign, you can imagine just how motivated I became to show her that we can still beat her with our small dollar donors. But, that's why I've got to ask you: can you pitch in just a few dollars to our campaign right now? Yeah -- you read that right. She's given herself 1.7 million dollars. So, I really mean it when I say that we need every single one of you to pitch in something to help us meet a massive haul like that. Can you help us get there by donating today?

Nicole from our team emailed you yesterday telling you that the NRCC just put Harley's opponent on their Young Guns list. That's a signal to everyone, including the gun lobby, to flood our race with dark money. Harley, on the other hand, is not a Young Gun and is not taking a cent from the gun lobby (or any other corporate special interest group). Rather, he was just awarded the 2020 Moms Demand Action Gun Sense Candidate distinction AND was just endorsed by Brady United Against Gun Violence and by Giffords: Courage to Fight Gun Violence. That's because Harley's working to protect our community and our children from gun violence, while his opponent is actively wooing gun lobbyists. The differences between Harley's views and that of his opponent could not be more disparate. It's critical we keep value-driven leaders like Harley in Congress. Will you donate now to help us do that? Let's elect him! \-- Alyssa Napuri, Campaign Director Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Harley and Alyssa emailed you yesterday about Michelle Steel attending an in-person fundraiser without masks. We just learned this wasn't a one-off. Just a week ago, she took a mask-less photo at a major indoor event for the right-wing leader Charlie Kirk. Check out her individual picture when he was off the main stage ⬇️ Let us be the first to tell you: jeopardizing lives for photo ops and big checks is not good leadership. Frankly, it's wrong, dangerous, and just plain selfish. We can't let someone like that take CA-48. But, the thing is: if we don't finish strong in this final week, that might just happen.

My opponent, Michelle Steel, just announced she'll be calling on Newt Gingrich to help her fundraise. I'm actually glad to hear that. Newt Gingrich was the reason why I left the Republican Party in 1997. So, for her to choose Newt to headline a fundraiser only serves as further validation of how different our priorities are. While Newt and Michelle attempt to restrict rights for LGBTQ folks and take away a woman's right to choose, I am fighting to expand people's rights and promote equality for all Americans. Will you help send a message to Newt and Michelle by donating to our campaign today? As Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich changed Republican politics for the worse. Under his leadership, the GOP shifted from a party focused on small government to one which insisted on government influence over social issues. I knew that I couldn't be a part of the Republican Party when its policies became intertwined with disallowing LGBTQ folks from marrying, restricting women's right to choose, ignoring climate science, and vilifying immigration. People like Michelle Steel and Newt Gingrich will continue to make politics about taking away rights and exacerbating partisanship. I think we should be doing the opposite. If you agree, will you donate to my campaign today? Thank you for showing your values! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Tomorrow marks one year since the House passed the For the People Act, the landmark campaign finance reform bill that protects the American people from dark money. And, now it's sitting in front of Mitch McConnell, who has refused to even look at the bill because he wants campaign finance and dark money to stay just the way it is.

Michelle Steel's team just announced that they have $2 million dollars on hand. That's after Michelle Steel misled Orange Countians about the county's coronavirus response performance, after she implied humans shouldn't have to wear masks if dogs don't, and after a video came out of her making homophobic jokes.

Since the start of this pandemic, our opponent has completely mishandled Orange County's response. And that begins with some of the totally false and absolutely dangerous things she's said about masks. The New York Magazine remembers a couple of those statements, starting with calling masks "species discrimination. Because if it's not healthy for the dogs, it's not healthy for us to be wearing it." And moving to her statement that, "[[URL REDACTED]]'s more dangerous, actually, you wearing a mask and then you run." Yes, she really said both those things. We cannot send someone to Congress who won't even advocate for the most basic steps to protect Orange County. That's why we're asking: can you chip in to our campaign today? It's clear: Michelle Steel did not protect Orange Countians. She risked thousands of lives with her actions and statements. And, what's worse is that, in the words of the New York Magazine, "Steel has made no apologies for her anti-mask position and hasn't moved to create any distance between herself and Trump." We're in an absolutely neck-and-neck race and need to show Orange County just how important it is to re-elect Harley. Can you help us do that by donating today?

I'm with Harley: I'm nervous, folks. It's Election Day, and we know we're in for a race that won't be quickly decided. Just like the New York Times, the LA Times, and The Independent, Harley and I both know that this race is going to be as close as it gets. But, rather than twiddling our thumbs waiting on the results, we're going to keep on fighting to make sure we can keep reaching voters and hitting our budget goals. That's why I'm asking: can you donate $10 right now? Happy Election Day! \-- Alyssa Napuri, Campaign Manager \---------- Forwarded message --------- I've always known this is going to be a competitive race. No matter how long I'm in Congress, it will probably always be competitive -- because this is just a tough district to win in for a Democrat. But, newspapers all over the place, from the LA Times to the New York Times to even The Independent in the UK, are now reiterating that we're in for a nail-biter. So, I'm nervous. Especially because this race has huge consequences for people in Orange County and across the country. Can you help me secure two more years in Washington by donating today? We've got a lot on the line this election. Fundamental rights and basic safety could be stripped away if my opponent wins this race. So, I'm coming to you now, the day before Election Day, to ask if you can donate $20 to my re-election campaign. Can you donate today? I'm so glad to be fighting with you by my side, \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hi there. Coming off another Election Day, I've been thinking a lot about how our campaigns are funded. So many campaigns are funded by special interests groups with ambiguous names and undisclosed donors, which makes it near impossible to track down where a candidate's support comes from. That's not the way we run our campaign, and that's not the way campaigns should be run. That's why on the 1-year anniversary of the For the People Act making its way through the House, I'm asking if you'll citizen co-sponsor the For the People Act >>> One year ago, I joined my colleagues in the House in passing the For the People Act. And now it's sitting on Mitch McConnell's desk where he refuses to take it up. That's why I need your help to tell McConnell that we want action on campaign finance now. Can you sign on? Thank you for taking action! \-- Team Rouda Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

In the midst of a global health crisis, this 50th anniversary of Earth Day feels a bit different than most. As we continue to social distance, we've already seen what having fewer cars on the road has done for congestion and pollution here in Orange County. It's a reminder of what our earth could look like if we continued to protect it from degradation. But, even now, our environment is continually under threat. Trump's EPA is using COVID-19 as an excuse to stop enforcing environmental protections. I'm calling on President Trump to protect our earth by continuing to enforce these essential environmental protections. Will you join me? We must protect our earth today, so our children and our children's children can enjoy it tomorrow. That's why it is so critical to tell President Trump that we can't stop enforcing environmental protections. Will you add your name if you agree? Thank you for taking action to help protect our earth, and, if you are able, I encourage you to go outside, practice social distancing, and enjoy all that the earth has to offer!

We're only months away from Election Day, and every single thing that we do between now and then to support Harley could be what wins us the election. Showing your support for Harley with a sign on your front lawn is a huge step towards securing that victory. It's what shows your neighbors that Harley's backed by YOUR support. Will you sign up to receive a yard sign today? Here's the thing: yard signs are a cost-effective way for grassroots campaigns, like ours, to get our message out.

I know that this sounds like a gimmick, but it's true! Trump's been double taxing Californians, so Harley has a plan to fix that and return $4,000 on average to our pockets: he's cosponsored the Stop the Attack on Local Taxpayers (SALT) Act, which lowers state and local taxes for hardworking Californians. So, if you want to reclaim about $4,000, give this article a read and call on lawmakers to pass the SALT Act >>> Since taking office, Trump has been targeting California.

In the midst of this health crisis, the EPA has stopped enforcing environmental protections. That means that our air, water, and lands have never been more vulnerable. This comes after the EPA announced that they would significantly reduce the amount of US waterways protected under the Clean Water Act, harming wildlife and polluting critical drinking water. We have to send a message to the federal government: our water protections are not up for negotiation. Will you add your name? The federal government is telling corporate polluters that they can do whatever they want during this period. That puts everyone at risk, including our residents who rely on clean drinking water and fresh air. Will you add your name if you agree that the EPA must protect our water and stop water protection rollbacks today?
