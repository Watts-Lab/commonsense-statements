We've done a lot here -- and we can do more together. Inslee Friend, Too many days mark tragic anniversaries. Today is one. Two years ago today, a gunman walked into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida and used a semi-automatic rifle to murder 17 people and wound 17 others. It remains one of the deadliest school shootings in the history of this country. And since then, Republicans in the Senate and President Donald Trump have done NOTHING to prevent more tragedies like it. But here in Washington state we are doing all we can to put an end to gun violence. This year I'm joining with Washington state's Attorney General Bob Ferguson to push for legislation that limits magazine capacity and bans the sale of assault weapons. Weapons of war do not belong on our streets and in our schools. We've made huge progress in the last few years to prevent gun violence -- but there's more we can do here. That's why I'm asking you to join me and the Washington Alliance for Gun Responsibility in calling on Washington state lawmakers to pass HB 2240/SB 6077, which limits high capacity magazines: Contact your legislator today and tell them to vote yes on these important bills to keep Washingtonians safe from gun violence today. CONTACT YOUR LEGISLATORS I'm proud of the work we've done in Washington state to reduce gun violence. Last year, we put a ban on ghost guns -- which are especially dangerous because they are made with 3-D printers and can go undetected by scanners. And in October, Seattle investigators removed a cache of firearms from a man believed to be a leader of the most violent extremist group in the country. They were able to do so thanks to the state's red flag law, passed by ballot initiative in 2016. But that's not enough: We need to pass HB 2240/SB 6077 and prohibit magazines that can carry more than 10 rounds of ammunition. This is a common sense measure that will save lives. We should be making it harder for those who want to inflict mass violence and destruction upon innocent people. And by limiting magazine capacity and banning assault weapons, we can work toward a day where no one in Washington state loses friends or family members to senseless gun violence. If you agree: Join me and the Washington Alliance for Gun Responsibility to tell Washington state lawmakers to pass HB 2240/SB 6077 and limit high capacity magazines on guns here to save lives.

Susan Wagle for Senate Alex -- Kansas now has four confirmed cases of the Coronavirus in the Kansas City area. Sadly, one other person has died as a result of the virus. Please keep the family of the person who died, those suffering and the medical professionals treating them in your prayers. Governor Laura Kelly has declared a state of emergency which will allow the state to access more resources and better respond to the spread of the coronavirus.

Susan Wagle for Senate Alex -- It was announced over the weekend that Kansas has its first confirmed case of Coronavirus. Now is not a time for panic. It is a time for caution and common sense. We need to be vigilant in avoiding direct human contact as those with symptoms may not know they are infected. We need to make sure we wash our hands and avoid contact with our face. Here is a link to the CDC’s prevention recommendations. Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. If you think you have the virus, please self-quarantine and follow the CDC recommendations found here. Governor Kelly’s administration is doing a good job keeping the legislature briefed and managing this potential crisis. We stand ready to work with her to make sure the state’s response meets the demands needed. At the federal level, Vice President Mike Pence is doing an outstanding job managing the federal response and Congress acted quickly to provide the administration the resources they need. As former Chair of the Senate Public Health and Welfare Committee, I have confidence in our ability to deal with this virus and manage the challenges ahead. This is an issue, that despite political differences on other important issues, everyone in Kansas government stands united to work together on.

Susan Wagle for Senate Alex -- America is in crisis as we combat a global public health pandemic. We are now being required to stay home to slow the spread of the coronavirus. As a result, our workers are being laid off and our small businesses are literally being forced to close their doors. Through very difficult times, I led the Kansas legislature to stay open and quickly do the people’s business by passing a budget before adjourning early so our leaders were able to go home and stay safe. This is exactly the type of leadership needed in Washington to put an end to the insanity going on in Congress today. Our workers and small businesses need help now. If ever there was a time for Congress to drop the partisanship and act in the interest of the American people, this is it. The Senate Republicans put forth a plan that would provide immediate financial support to laid off workers, help small businesses stay open and keep people employed. It will also provide support for devastated industries we will need to get our economy back on track when this is over. The plan provides resources and support for hospitals and medical professionals who are the front lines combating this pandemic. What are the Democrats doing? Slowing down progress to force upon us parts of their radical Green New Deal. A Democratic operative once remarked, “Never let a good crisis go to waste.” Speaker Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer are taking this to a disgraceful ending by blocking the much-needed stimulus package.  We can’t let that happen. I’m deeply concerned about the massive debt we are saddling with our children. But in the short term, I’m more interested in slowing the spread of the coronavirus and getting our economy jump started. I also want to quickly reach a point where people can return to work while we protect those most vulnerable. In order to do this, we all need to do our part in this 15-day period. The least the Democrats in Congress can do is put aside their own self-interests and vote for American workers and small businesses. Join me in praying for our medical professionals and that wisdom and common sense will be restored to Congress. P.S.

Now is a time to use good judgement and practice common sense. Visit our website Friend, President Trump has declared a national emergency to address the coronavirus. Governor Justice has done the same in West Virginia. The U.S. Senate will be in session next week to do our part to address this growing public health crisis. My top priority is the health, safety and well-being of all West Virginians. Due to the evolving concerns over the coronavirus, I have asked my campaign to postpone all campaign related events in West Virginia that are scheduled for the next few weeks. I will also not be attending any political events during this time. I encourage all West Virginians to stay home as much as possible and remain safe. I look forward to returning to the campaign trail. In the meantime, my campaign will use other methods to reach out and talk to voters. For more about the virus go to the Center for Disease Control’s website. All of us play a key role in preventing the spread of this disease. Good practices include washing your hands, coughing into your elbow, avoid touching your face and replacing conventional greetings like handshakes by looking people in the eye when greeting them. Symptoms may appear between 2 and 14 days from exposure. They include a fever, cough and shortness of breath. If you feel like you have the virus, please contact your doctor and self-quarantine to protect others. West Virginia has a large elderly population which are the most at risk for developing complications from this virus. West Virginians are resilient. We take care of each other. Now is not the time for panic. It is a time to use good judgement, practice common sense and check in on family, friends and neighbors. Stay safe.

Help Fair and Square flip Texas Blue! We need this to change. NOW. We're going to get through the coronavirus outbreak together. If you are experiencing symptoms or are looking for more information, you can visit the website of the CDC or the Texas Department of Health. We are closely monitoring the situation and its effects on the people of Texas and our nation as we work together to keep our families and communities safe. Friends, We can’t emphasize this enough -- if Texas doesn’t implement a safe vote-by-mail system soon, millions of voters will be disenfranchised on November 3rd. This will be the most critical election day in Texas history. And the Texas GOP is well aware that they could lose. That’s why they are misinforming the public with debunked voter fraud conspiracies. That’s why they are ignoring our demand to protect voters during an unprecedented pandemic -- and threatening to prosecute voters who are afraid to risk their lives at the polls. We can’t let Republicans get away with this. We need to act fast and demand safe voting before it’s too late. Sign our petition to demand Texas expand vote-by-mail for ALL voters >>> November’s election is less than 5 months away. And Texas is on the verge of becoming the next outbreak hotspot -- with record-breaking cases and hospitalizations every day. This should be common sense, but Republicans don’t seem to care. People shouldn't have to choose between their right to vote and their health. Period. Sign On Now >>> Together, we will fight for our democracy and the right for every American to vote safely. Thank you for standing with us, Team Fair & Square Sign The Petition >>> Thanks for supporting Fair and Square PAC.

no one should have to pay rent during a pandemic Alex, A pandemic is bad enough, but now it’s put many Americans out of work—and rent is due. Fortunately, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D—MN) has proposed an elegant solution. Her bill, H.R. 6515, is titled the Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act. Introduced in April and cosponsored by the rest of the Squad as well as many renters’ organizations, H.R. 6515 would establish a national relief fund to pay landlords their rent, and mortgage banks their home payments. No one would have to return to work when it’s dangerous, or risk eviction. Can you chip in today and help us win so renters can get a fair shake from Congress during tough and unpredictable times? So what happened to it? The bill is being stonewalled by corporate Democrats in the House, led by House Speaker—and wealthy landlord—Nancy Pelosi. Her priorities are ridiculous, as well as offensive. Congress has found money for Trump’s surveillance, for militarized DHS thugs, for a bloated & fraudulent war budget, and for endless corporate bailouts—but not for renters during a pandemic and recession. Once I’m in Congress, we’ll join this bill as a cosponsor and make San Francisco’s voice on it a loud and clear “yes.” New voices are needed in Congress that represent working people, instead of corporations & banks. Can you make a donation today so we can turn the “Squad” into a Platoon? Ensuring that voters don’t go homeless during a catastrophe shouldn’t be a partisan or ideological issue. Like funding firefighters, it’s simple common sense. Thanks for standing with us on the right side of history. We’re proud to stand with you. Shahid Want to give now?

This is who our campaign is meant for, friend -- and leaders all over the country are recognizing just what this movement can accomplish. It’s made our historically safe-Republican district a toss-up. It has proven that the voters in this district are sick of political games, demanding accountability from an opponent who politicized the coronavirus, calling common sense safety measures “unAmerican” and refusing to enforce laws that are meant to keep us safe. And, most importantly, it has put the issues our families care about at the forefront. With you by our side, we can finally deliver on these issues and make progress on health care and our economy -- but first, we have to win this election. We have two months left until Election Day, and only a few hours left before a critical fundraising deadline that will shape how we campaign for the next two months.

Much is at stake, as the country is not in great shape. It’s vital that this election be transparent and fair, and that everyone who is legally entitled to vote in November can do so and do so safely." Donate to our GOTV Fund ➜ Hi Team, Sri emailed you yesterday about our new plan to Get Out the Vote this fall, as it looks increasingly likely that we will be continuing social distancing into the weeks leading up to November. We know voting in this year’s election will look different than it has in the past, so we need to make sure that we’re prepared to help voters cast their ballots, no matter the circumstances. The data is clear, team: If we achieve a record turn-out in TX-22 in 2020, this district WILL flip blue. Can you make a donation to our GOTV fund to help Sri and our team ensure that not even one voter sits this election out because they are afraid or don’t have the information to vote? >>> TX-22 has been named one of the top pick-up opportunities for Democrats in 2020. Last month we were named to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's prestigious Red to Blue list, and this month Cook Political Report singled our district out, proclaiming that Democrats “have a good chance” of winning this seat! Sri’s message is catching fire, team. Houston families are tired of political grandstanding and do-nothing representation. While our opponents compete in a race to the far right, Sri is focused on helping the community now and bringing common sense solutions that work for Texans to DC. We will win this election if we’re able to provide voters with the information they need to safely cast their ballots. Donate now to help us get out the vote and ensure commonsense leadership prevails in 2020!

Team, We’re faced with an unprecedented health crisis and we’re using our campaign platform to get the word out about staying safe and following the CDC’s recommendations for social distancing by canceling all in-person events and moving our organizing efforts online. This is especially important in our district which is one of the most diverse in the country, with many multi-generational families living under the same roofs. Please be mindful in practicing social distancing, especially with your family elders. We’re monitoring things on a daily basis, and will be sure to share any critical updates with you. We also remain committed to the work we have ahead of us to win in November, including raising the resources to continue getting the word out about the important issues at stake in this race: affordable healthcare, lowering prescription drug prices, and protecting Medicaid and Social Security. Our decisive win in the primary shows we have the support and the votes to win this race and flip our district. Help us bring science and common sense back to Washington. If you’re able, can you pitch in anything you can spare to help us?

With the election coming up quickly, I want to reach out and ask if you can donate to a candidate for U.S. Congress that I have known and worked with for more than 15 years, Stephen Daniel. Dear friend, With the election coming up quickly, I want to reach out and ask if you can donate to a candidate for U.S. Congress that I have known and worked with for more than 15 years, Stephen Daniel. During our time working together, I have been consistently impressed by his integrity, hard work and commitment to helping others. From fighting for justice for his clients to serving as a steward for his community, Stephen is one of the best we have. Stephen is emblematic of the common sense that we need to restore in Washington. He approaches every problem with a level head and works to find the best solution for everyone, not himself. He follows his moral compass, not the whims of whatever is easiest. He never ceases to do right by his clients, his family or his friends, and that’s what makes him a good man. Stephen is running in Texas's 6th Congressional District. This is a district we can win this year and I need your help to get it on the radar of the folks in Washington. Beto O'Rourke barely lost the district during his run for Senate in 2018 and the explosive growth of our area has made it even more competitive.

There are a lot of problems Congress can fix if we work together and use common sense. Friends and Neighbors, I am so excited to share our newest ad with you, explaining what inspired me to roll up my sleeves and run for school board. You can click here to watch it and, if you’re able, pitch in a few dollars to keep it on the air. Watch our ad » Now, I never planned to run for office. But Friend, when I saw my sons and their teachers sweating in 98 degree classrooms and the school board refusing to take action, I knew I had to do something. It’s just common sense -- if we want our children to be able to learn, we need to give them the best environment to do so. So I ran for school board and I won. Not only did we get the schools air conditioned, but we got all 6 of my campaign priorities accomplished. This story is important because too often, politicians come around asking for your vote for the wrong reasons. Serving on my local school board and the city council, I found that if you’re willing to roll up your sleeves and work together, you can actually get a lot done for people. This common-sense approach helped me in Jefferson City, where every bill I passed has had bipartisan support. And in Congress, you can trust that I will always work to find common ground on the issues that matter most to Missourians. We’re coming up on our end-of-month fundraising deadline in just a few short days, and we still need to raise $15,000 from our grassroots supporters online to keep our ad on the air and continue reaching voters. If you’re able, will you consider chipping in any amount now to help us meet this important fundraising goal?

We are facing unprecedented challenges, and it’s more important now than ever that we have leaders in our community who are putting the health, safety, and well-being of our hard-working families first. As a state senator, I’ve been working with local and state leaders to expand access to testing, provide more resources for health care workers, and support our local economy as we weather this crisis. Now, I’m hoping to take my results-driven approach and make an even greater impact for our community, which is why I’m running for Congress. People in Missouri are tired of business as usual in Washington. Partisan bickering has become the unfortunate norm, even in times of crisis. But throughout my career, I’ve worked with people with whom I don’t always agree to find common ground to get things done. That is what I’ve always done, and that’s what I’ll continue to do in Congress. If we’re going to flip MO-02 blue in November, I’ll need people like you by my side. Grassroots supporters are the key to fueling this people-powered campaign in one of the most competitive districts in the entire country. Will you join our team, Friend? Join our team » My focus is not ideology. It’s working for the people I am elected to represent -- including making sure we have access to affordable health care, we can afford the medications we need, and we can protect our small businesses and economy. So if you’re with us, join our team below. Together we can flip MO-02 blue and bring some common sense and civility back to Washington.

If you wish to no longer receive email from us, please unsubscribe. Friends and Neighbors, This is a difficult time for our state and our country. We are facing unprecedented challenges with the COVID-19 pandemic, and it’s more important now than ever that we have leaders in our community who are putting the health, safety, and well-being of our hard-working families first. As a state senator, I’ve been working with local and state leaders to expand access to testing, provide more resources for health care and frontline workers, and support our local economy as we weather this crisis. Now, I’m hoping to take my results-driven approach and make an even greater impact for our community, which is why I’m running for Congress. People in Missouri are tired of business as usual in Washington. Partisan bickering has become the unfortunate norm, even in times of crisis. But throughout my career, I’ve worked with people with whom I don’t always agree to find common ground to get things done. That is what I’ve always done, and that’s what I’ll continue to do in Congress. If we’re going to flip MO-02 blue in November, I’ll need people like you by my side. Grassroots supporters are the key to fueling this people-powered campaign in one of the most competitive districts in the entire country. Will you join our team, Friend? Join our team » My focus is not ideology. It’s working for the people I am elected to represent -- including making sure we have access to affordable health care, we can afford the medications we need, and we can protect our small businesses and economy. So if you’re with us, join our team below. Together we can flip MO-02 blue and bring some common sense and civility back to Washington. Join our team » Above all else, please stay safe and healthy, and continue following the important guidelines from the CDC around hand washing and social distancing.

Let me explain why I’m supporting Jill We hope you enjoy this longer note from Mayor Harold Dielmann, a lifelong Republican who was mayor of Creve Coeur, Missouri for 28 years, on why he supports Jill. If you don’t have time to read it all (that’s okay!), will you consider chipping in any amount to help Jill reach her most important fundraising deadline to date so she can win this TOSS-UP race? Donate now » Friend, Today, my friend Jill Schupp is taking a day of reflection to observe Yom Kippur, so I wanted to use the opportunity to reach out and explain why, as a lifelong Republican, I am supporting Jill this year in her race to represent Missouri’s Second District.  I served with Jill when I was Mayor of Creve Coeur, Missouri, and she was on the City Council. I have seen Jill in action firsthand, and when she wants to get something done, nothing can stand in her way. From my time working with Jill, I know that she is a consensus-builder and works well with other people, and this shows clearly in her record. In fact, every bill Jill has passed in the legislature has had bipartisan support. I know Jill can bring back common sense to our government and that she’ll work hard for real solutions to the challenges facing Missourians. Friend, believe me when I say that for Jill, it’s not about a political party, it’s about doing what’s best for people. That’s why I say Jill Schupp is a people candidate, not a party candidate. I’ve been a Republican all my life -- that’s 90 years. I am proud to support Jill in this election, but I know she has a tough fight ahead in these final weeks. She has a very important fundraising deadline coming up in just a few days, so I would appreciate it if you would consider chipping in to help her win this race so she can go to Washington and get things done for Missouri families.

Team Culp, Did you see Loren’s email this morning? I know you’re busy, so I’ll keep this brief: we have just a few hours left to hit our end-of-quarter goals, and I’m hoping you can help. Since joining Loren’s campaign, I’ve gotten to know him. And let me tell you, he is without a doubt the person Washington needs if we’re going to restore common sense to our state government. We’re in a big fight, but we can beat Jay Inslee if we all unite right now. Help us reach our goals by midnight, and send a message to Jay Inslee, by making a contribution now.

Jay Inslee has had time to make change happen in Washington - and yet, what we have consistently gotten are lies and broken promises. No images? Click here It just takes a little common sense and some integrity. Jay Inslee has had time to make change happen in Washington - and yet, what we have consistently gotten are lies and broken promises. Jay said he supported Boeing, then he pushed them out. Boeing was so done with Jay, they wouldn’t even take his calls. (He learned about them leaving thru the news media... How does that happen with such a big employer in your state?) Jay said 8 years ago he was not going to raise taxes and then raised them 33 times. Jay consistently fought and stifled the will of the people (car tabs anyone?) Jay said he did know about CHOP/CHAZ, then said he did know, so he lied? Apple farmers homes and businesses burn down and Jay brings them maggot infected apples? That is not what people want or need when they have just lost everything!!! They need some love, some care, some food, a blanket and a hug - AND to know their governor will support their community in actionable ways. Jay hired un-proven consultants in a no-bid contract at $167,000 per week to help Washington? Come on Jay? Would you hire someone who has never built a home to build you a home for your family? No way! Under Jay's watch, the most police officers EVER have left downtown Seattle. Jay is soft on crime and tough on our people and our businesses. How much is enough?  How much until Washington breaks under Jay’s reign of terror, mismanagement, and lies? Why NOT Now? Why NOT have change NOW? I encourage, urge you, and enlist you to support this cause and take action!!!! ~ Loren Culp Don’t wake up on Nov 4th wishing you had done more - that you had spoken with your friends and family.

Alex, I was recently interviewed by Jason Rantz about the Capitol Hill Organized Protest zone in Seattle, and what I would do as Governor. As I said during the interview, we have leadership in Seattle and leadership in Olympia that doesn’t have a spine and doesn’t realize that there are people in there that have businesses and homes, and the good people of Seattle need to be protected. There needs to be law and order. As a conservative police chief, I believe in the right to peacefully assemble and protest. What I don’t believe in, however, is lawlessness and complicit government leadership. When I’m governor, I will shut down those who wish to bring anarchy to our cities by torching businesses, burning cars, and assaulting citizens. If you believe, like I do, that it’s time for the lawlessness to end, can I count on your support this month? We’re up against a huge deadline on the 30th, and I want to make sure we hit our goals. Together, we can win this campaign and bring common sense to Olympia. The establishment politicians there may not like me, but I’m running to deliver for the people of Washington, not them. Join my campaign and help us hit our end of quarter fundraising goals by clicking here now. Thank you, Loren facebook twitter * * * PAID FOR BY CULP FOR GOVERNOR (R) 2020 Unsubscribe

Good leaders listen, great leaders learn and take action. [[URL REDACTED]] Donate Today Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram Friend, I have been listening. I have been reading your emails, listening to your phone calls, and speaking with you at our virtual town halls. I have been listening to my friends and community members for the thirty years I have lived in this great district. I promise to continue listening to all sides, including those who disagree with me. Scott Fitzgerald does not listen. Just last week 34 faith leaders sent a letter to Fitzgerald praying that he examine his conscience and push for policies that keep us safe during this pandemic. By forcing WI to reopen without common-sense policies to keep our communities safe, Fitzgerald put us all in danger. The US just reached 3 million Coronavirus cases, Fitzgerald is certainly doing his part to keep those numbers on the rise. Voters, business owners, and religious leaders are begging him to listen, but he won’t. Maybe he’s frightened that Trump will criticize him. Maybe he just isn’t doing his research. Maybe he will do whatever it takes to win, even if it means more Wisconsinites die. This is unacceptable. Join me and let’s fight for common sense and conscientious solutions. Please, can you chip in $5, $10, or $20 to help me stop Scott Fitzgerald? As your congressman, I will listen to you. I will continue to learn from you. And I will lead with YOU.

Wow, is this seriously our President? [[URL REDACTED]] Donate Today Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram Friend, Over 120,000 American lives have been lost to the Coronavirus. The gravity of this grim milestone seems to be lost on our President. Like you, we’ve been watching Trump this last week and have been baffled. Whether it’s the weird tirades to empty seats at his Tulsa rally or the nonsensical twitter storms, it is clear that Trump does not care about our COVID crisis. As COVID cases climb across our country, Trump is moving to end testing. Let that sink in. The virus will not go away if we pretend it is over. Americans will not stop dying if we stop testing. Tom is fighting for enhanced testing capabilities. Tom supports science. Tom leads with a clear vision for reopening, which balances our economic interests with our health and well-being.

Friends, We email you a lot about how Alyse and our team are creating a movement for change here in Alaska, and asking you for the resources to help to build it. But today, we want you to hear from folks who have already invested in our campaign. We asked why they were inspired to give, and here are just a few of the responses. Philippe from Anchorage gave because he shares Alyse’s values and vision for our future: “I contribute to Ms. Galvin's campaign because she represents a common sense, people first drive in politics for the state. I have great admiration for her, I have seen first hand what a wonderful volunteer she was (we had children in the same school some years ago) and she is the kind of leader I want for our community. I trust that she will put Alaskans first in her policy and voting decisions because she is a true Alaskan.  We share the same values and the same vision for our community, now and for the future.” CONTRIBUTE Allison from Palmer says she contributed after connecting with Alyse in person: “I know that meeting her made such an impact. It is vitally important that people in rural areas have the opportunity to get to know her too. They deserve the chance for better health care, and a policy that will protect indigenous lands. To meet her is to trust her. Alyse is intelligent, kind, and authentic." CONTRIBUTE And Derek from Anchorage told us he stepped up because he appreciates Alyse’s pledge to refuse corporate PAC money: “I want to see less corporate money in politics. In order to do that, candidates need a viable alternative campaign funding source which means I need to step up to help out. If thousands others like me do the same, we might actually see politicians working for the people of the district they represent instead of the money interests that put them there.” CONTRIBUTE Today, we hope you’ll join Philippe, Allison, Derek, and supporters across the state by chipping in $5, $20, or whatever you can to power Alyse’s movement for change.

Team, We could list all of the terrible things that President Trump has done during this pandemic that have put millions of us at risk. The way he's been handling the response to the coronavirus is an affront to us all.

Hi there, as you know all too well, we lost a national hero just weeks ago when Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. Now, Mitch McConnell and Trump are teaming up to rush a conservative Justice with starkly different judicial views than her predecessor into the highest court of the land. And they're doing that while Americans are already voting for the next president. That's not only unfair to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but also it undermines the power of our democracy. Will you join me in demanding the Senate let our next president decide upon Ruth Bader Ginsburg's replacement? Thanks for upholding our democracy! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hi there, I'm just quickly reaching out to let you know that there are only ten days until this election is over, and we're going to have to keep fighting up until the moment polls close. I'll tell you why: Republicans still outnumber Democrats in the district, and now radical right special interest groups are throwing their weight behind my opponent because she'll rubber stamp their out of touch policies. I know it's not going to be easy to keep this seat. But, that's all the more reason to fight tooth-and-nail until we win this race. We simply can't afford to let up. I know we can do this. But, I will need your help. Can you donate a few dollars today to help us continue our fight until Election Day?

There's a lot that happens every single day, so it can be easy to forget that the election is in one month. But, let's be clear: that's reallllly soon. And we're going to need to use every single one of these next 31 days to show Orange Countians that they need to vote for Harley Rouda. Can you help us do that by donating right now? With coronavirus continuing to spread and affecting even our highest officeholders, two things are more clear than ever: we have to follow science, and we've got to protect folks' healthcare.

Our end-of-month fundraising deadline is in just hours. With mail-in ballots being delivered in just over a month, hitting our goal this month will be a huge part of determining how many people we can reach with Harley's message before they return their ballots. Hitting our August fundraising goal is critical since all of Orange County will be able to vote by mail this year instead of going to packed polling places on Election Day. So, can you donate right now to our campaign? This election is one of the most competitive races in the entire country. Period. POLITICO has called our race a "toss-up" and Inside Elections thinks it's the most competitive race in Orange County. That means we have just over a month to convince enough Orange County voters to mail in their ballots for Harley -- and it won't necessarily be easy.

You know the type. You answer the phone, you say hello, you're waiting on the line, and then finally a monotone voice announces that the IRS is after you. It's extremely frustrating.

Hi there -- our end-of-quarter deadline is tonight at midnight -- and, in all honesty, hitting our goal is an essential step towards giving our grassroots campaign the momentum we need to keep this seat blue on Election Day. That's why I have to ask: can you donate to our campaign today? We know this race isn't going to be easy. It wasn't easy in 2018 when Harley became the first Democrat to win this seat ever. And it won't be easy today. Corporate special interest groups are flooding our race with Big Money, POLITICO has rated our race a toss-up, and Republicans make up the majority of our district.

Hi there. June is our second to last chance to post the kind of end of quarter numbers that will silence the NRCC once and for all. A new rating just showed that our race is the most competitive in all of Orange County. That's a sign to the NRCC that they should jump straight into our race and try everything they can to flip it red. Our best bet to fend off these attacks is to post record high end of quarter fundraising numbers. Will you help us do that by donating to our campaign today? I'm just going to say it bluntly: we need a huge fundraising showing this June. With the election just months away, hitting our target this end of quarter is non-negotiable.

Harley sent out an email yesterday about the profound repercussions of Trump's attacks against the USPS. In it, he swore that he'd protect USPS and our democracy -- no matter what lies Trump and his administration spew. We've forwarded it below for context! He's already making good on his word. Today, our campaign joined leaders in a safe rally in support of the USPS (check out Harley speaking at it below!). Harley will always stand for what's right and try to make good on his word -- that's what made him the most productive freshman member and why we need him in Congress. Will you donate now to help us keep him there? Thank you!!! \-- Rouda HQ \---------- Forwarded message --------- President Trump openly admitted to blocking USPS funding to stop Americans from voting safely and securely. Let me repeat: the President of the United States of America publicly confirmed that he is actively sabotaging our right to a free and fair election. This is bigger than petty partisan politics; it is an attack on the foundation of our nation. This is a war waged on the bedrock principles of our republic -- the right to use your vote to make your voice heard and hold elected officials accountable. This is a "where were you and what did you do to stop it" moment in history. With the election right around the corner, I need your help to keep defending our democracy. Can you give now? I'll keep doing everything I can to protect our elections, including questioning Postmaster General DeJoy, supporting efforts to preserve USPS, and sounding the alarm -- but I need your help. The Trump Administration and complicit Republican members of Congress have sought to undermine our democracy -- but we need to show them that the power still rests with the people. Can you help me do that by chipping in to our grassroots campaign and allowing me to bring the voice of hardworking, everyday Orange Countians to Congress?

Hey -- it's Alyssa, Harley's campaign manager. I'm reaching out because Harley's on his way to meet Michelle for their debate. However, it's unlikely she'll even turn up. We want to show Harley that, even though his opponent is refusing to engage, we still think he's doing the right thing by trying to facilitate a debate. That's why we're going to try to flood him with donations for the rest of the night -- it'll be the perfect way to show him that we support his effort and to help us reach our end-of-month fundraising goal. Will you donate right now to our campaign? Harley's opponent is doing everything she can to get out of debating Harley. She even just tried to blame her absence on the fact that a local Democratic group is going to be watching the debate. We've already told her that we're trying to make this as fair as possible, but she won't even engage the possibility of a debate.

Yesterday, I sent a letter to Michelle Steel's campaign team. It was a follow up to another letter we sent weeks ago asking Michelle Steel if she wanted to join Harley in a debate. Check it out >> We all know that debates are essential. They're one of the only ways that folks can get a sense of the candidate they're voting for. Yet, Michelle Steel has left our calls for a fair debate unanswered. That's not fair to Orange Countians. Will you sign our petition if you agree that the people of CA-48 have a right to watch Harley and Michelle debate? Michelle Steel has no problem attacking our campaign on social media -- but she still won't agree to a fair debate. It's time to show the people of Orange County just what Harley and Michelle stand for. Are you with me? Thank you! \-- Alyssa Napuri, Campaign Manager Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Some of you probably saw Harley and me questioning Postmaster General Louis DeJoy about the USPS on Monday -- and you probably also saw how flummoxed he was by some of our most basic questions. Our elected and appointed officials should know their jobs inside and out -- that's what taxpayers pay us for. As one of my neighboring members, I know Harley well. And, I know that when I question him about what's happening to small business owners in Costa Mesa or how climate change is affecting our Orange County beaches or how the district is handling the coronavirus response, he knows exactly what's going on. We need to keep leaders like that in the House. That's why I'm asking if you can donate to Harley's campaign today? We're less than 70 days from Election Day, and Harley is in one of the most competitive races in the entire country. That's why I have to ask if you'll help Harley hit his end-of-month fundraising goal before Monday. Can you donate today?

Hi there -- I just wanted to make sure you saw this note from our finance director, Nicole? Our opponent's campaign is driven by massive donations from Big Money. In fact, her average donation is more than 10 times what ours is. But, we're so proud that our campaign is funded by grassroots donors because that's an indication that Harley's only accountable to everyday folks like you. With our end of the month deadline in a couple of days, will you help us show our opponent that we have the support of everyday Orange Countians by donating to our campaign today? \---------- Forwarded message --------- We emailed you yesterday about how Harley's opponent is stockpiling her war chest. Well, we crunched the numbers and found that the average donation amount to her campaign is over 10 times what ours is. We're proud of that because it means that our campaign is fueled by everyday folks like you. Because our campaign is truly grassroots, we depend on small donations. Can you donate $10 to our campaign today? Our campaign is about serving everyday Orange Countians -- not deep-pocketed special interests. Will you help us send a message to Harley's opponent that our grassroots strength is strong enough to match their war chest by donating today?

November will bring critical elections at every level of government, including our election here in Orange County and a presidential election that will decide our country's future. While Americans across the country are sheltering-in-place and practicing social distancing, this election could call upon Americans to put their health on the line in order to choose who will represent them in office. Every American should be able to vote without worrying about contracting or spreading coronavirus. That's why I'm pushing for vote by mail for all voters. Will you join me? States that have enacted vote by mail policies have seen large increases in voter turnout, and the more people we have weighing in on who will represent us, the stronger our democracy will be.

Hi there, I'm just following up on Nicole's email from the other day about Michelle Steel giving her campaign $1.7 million dollars. Turns out, she's not the only deep-pocketed donor funding her campaign. We just learned that the NRA, the anti-choice Susan B. Anthony Candidate Fund, and the Trump-backing billionaires Sheldon and Meriam Adelson have all given her campaign thousands of dollars. And, because I'm not taking a dime from corporate Super PACs, I'm counting on grassroots donors just like you to donate to our campaign. Can you do that? Thank you so much! \-- Harley \---------- Forwarded message --------- Hey there! It's Nicole, Harley's finance director. With only 19 days until the election, you can bet that I'm keeping my eye on how many small dollar donations we're bringing in and how many big checks our opponent is raking in. So, when I got the FEC notification just minutes ago that Michelle Steel's Q3 numbers were in and saw that she's given herself 1.7 million dollars over the course of this campaign, you can imagine just how motivated I became to show her that we can still beat her with our small dollar donors. But, that's why I've got to ask you: can you pitch in just a few dollars to our campaign right now? Yeah -- you read that right. She's given herself 1.7 million dollars.

The Los Angeles Times just released a story about how Republicans in Orange County are going to flood our district with money to unseat Harley. They think that this District is going to flip back to red. But, we know that they're wrong. But, in order to show them that, we need your help to make sure Harley knocks Tuesday's election out of the park >>> The article cites that Harley's challenger has outraised us in two of the four quarters last year. And, we know that Harley has challengers who can write themselves huge checks and who are happy to take money from special interests. Which means that we're relying on grassroots donors like you. Can you give to Harley's campaign today to make sure this seat stays blue? Thanks for your support! \-- Team Rouda Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

During his time in Congress, he's embraced common sense and values to tackle climate change, address deteriorating infrastructure, confront homelessness, and protect Social Security and Medicare. In 2020, Harley will be facing one of the toughest re-election fights in the entire country, so he's depending on the support of grassroots individuals.

I just saw an absolutely revolting story: that Donald Trump and Dana Rohrabacher conspired to offer Julian Asange a pardon if he said that Russia was not involved in leaking Democratic party emails. That's appalling and is just another example of Trump, Rohrabacher, and their Russian allies' coordinated attempts to hide the truth and place blame on others. We cannot have leaders in our offices who abuse the rule of law. You elected me last year because you saw through Rohrabacher's falsehoods. I'm ready to keep standing up for what's right. But, I need your help to do that. Will you donate to our campaign today? Politics should not be a calculating, power-grabbing game. It should be about representing the American people. I'm prepared to keep standing up for our values and leading this district transparently and honestly. Will you help me do that?

Yesterday, Harley sent out an email to thank you for donating to our local Orange County nonprofits and in the hopes of raising even more money for the organizations. Once again, you all delivered -- and Harley couldn't be more excited. I can tell you firsthand that Harley's been consumed by making sure Orange Countians are protected from coronavirus and its societal side effects. So, it was great to chat with him about our deep appreciation of your generous donations yesterday. He truly admires the way all of you look out for your fellow Orange Countians. I, for one, am proud to be tasked with making sure Harley is re-elected come November because I know that when times are tough, he will go the extra mile to protect his constituents. Better yet, he'll do it with excitement, tenacity, and humility. Will you help us make sure that he's still in Washington to do that by donating to our campaign today? Thank you so much, \-- Alyssa \---------- Forwarded message --------- Hi, A few weeks ago, I asked if you would consider donating to some of our local Orange County organizations that are doing their part to help fight the effects of the coronavirus. You answered with unmistakable force, allowing us to collectively donate almost $15,000 to our local charities. With your donations, we can put food on the table for our recently unemployed Orange Countians. We can support our valiant health care workers who are risking their lives to protect ours. We can help our small businesses who are facing bankruptcy due to closures. As we face another week of sheltering-in-place and as we anticipate more coronavirus cases, I'm asking if you will once again consider donating to these charities? If we step up and help each other now, we will get through this health crisis quicker and find ourselves more connected once it's over. Can you donate today to help our local organizations?

Like so many of you, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death left me stunned and deeply saddened. She was a force of a justice and a woman -- someone who was relentless in her pursuit of justice and grounded by her sense of right. She led a life striving towards making our country a better and fairer place up until her last breath. Her death also left me scared. Scared because I know that this administration will choose short-term political gain over precedent, political process, and a sense of right. And that decision could alter our lives and freedoms for generations. Ruth Bader Ginsburg lived her entire life in search of the good -- for all Americans. Now, it's our time to continue her path and make this election a referendum on what's right. That's why I'm encouraging you: vote, vote, vote. This is your opportunity to make your voice heard. If you need convincing, just look at how much has happened in these past four years. And, if you can, sign up to volunteer! Yes, we would love for you to volunteer for our campaign (and you can do so here!), but if you can't volunteer for us, volunteer for another campaign. Ruth Bader Ginsburg irreversibly changed our country. The opinions she wrote will impact our grandchildren's grandchildren. But, we too have the chance to direct our country's future for generations -- just as she did. That's why I'm begging you not to give up this opportunity. Please do whatever you can to make our country a better place before November 3rd. None of us wants to wake up on November 4th and regret not doing more. You really can make a difference, and together, we will get it done. Thank you! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

We've tried to set up a debate between Harley and Michelle several times. We've emailed her, we've mailed her a letter, we've even used social media to try to get in touch. She still has not responded. It's clear that she's not interested in a debate, but we're still so curious why... Our elected officials are expected to speak in public and share their ideas with the people -- why the hesitation on her part? We're trying one more tactic. We're making a petition calling on her to join a debate today. Will you add your name today? With critical questions facing our country each and every day, we need leaders who are willing to fight for their opinions and policy positions. That's expected of our members of Congress, and that's what Michelle Steel should do as a candidate for Congress. Will you sign on to our petition to request she agrees to a fair debate?

We're living through a pivotal period in history that has the potential to transform our nation. We need leaders who we can trust to guide us through this turning point. Michelle Steel has put the lives of Orange Countians at risk time and time again. She's implied that wearing masks is hazardous to human lives (despite medical evidence), she's called for repealing the Affordable Care Act, and she's stood with Trump through every one of his hateful remarks. Harley, on the other hand, has connected healthcare workers with the protective gear they need, is voting today to strengthen and broaden the ACA, and is standing for human rights each and every day. The choice is obvious in our mind. Will you donate today if you agree that we need at least two more years of Harley? Our quarter ends tomorrow, so this is our last chance to show Michelle Steel and her deep-pocketed allies that our grassroots team is not backing down. We're ready to stand for what's right and make sure Harley has two more years in the House. Can you help us do that by donating today?

We emailed you yesterday about how Harley's opponent is stockpiling her war chest. Well, we crunched the numbers and found that the average donation amount to her campaign is over 10 times what ours is. We're proud of that because it means that our campaign is fueled by everyday folks like you. Because our campaign is truly grassroots, we depend on small donations. Can you donate $10 to our campaign today? Our campaign is about serving everyday Orange Countians -- not deep-pocketed special interests.

Early ballots for Harley's March election are already here, which is a really big deal because this election is the first chance to show how much Harley's constituents approve of his performance in office. Here's the bad news: The NRCC is funneling money into Harley's challengers' campaigns, and one of Harley's competitors is even writing herself checks for half a million dollars. But, the good news is that we know we have a vast network of grassroots supporters who are willing to show Harley just how much they back his performance. Will you donate now and turn in your ballot today to make sure we blow Harley's competitors out of the water in March? We have less than one month until the election, so every bit of support matters a lot.

Hi there -- We just wanted to send along a quick note to tell you what Harley's been doing to help Orange Countians combat the effects of COVID-19: 1\. Harley has connected individuals and private businesses that can manufacture or donate personal protective equipment to hospitals and first responders that are in dire need of this equipment. You can still sign up to manufacture or donate this gear here. 2\. He helped pass the $2.2 trillion coronavirus aid plan, which expands unemployment benefits, provides money for small businesses, gives payments to most Americans, offers relief for state and local governments, and aids hospitals affected by the crisis. 3\. He's rallied around local Orange County nonprofits that are helping those affected by COVID-19. We encourage you to donate to these organizations, if you are able. 4\. He's spoken with economic leaders across the globe about how to make sure Americans are kept on their feet, and he's used this work to help form legislation in Congress. 5\. He's asked you to join our campaign in calling our elderly neighbors. We just had a phone bank to call our seniors earlier today. Keep watching out here for future phone banks. 6\. He helped pass an emergency supplemental bill that allows Orange County businesses to access $7 billion in low-interest loans. If you are a small business owner, we encourage you to apply for these loans by emailing the Small Business Association customer service center. 7\. He's sent around trusted sites for further guidance on the virus. For updates in California, we encourage you to use the California Department of Public Health's website. 8\. He's used public platforms like Facebook and Twitter to share updates and general information about COVID-19. This is a challenging time for all of us, but Harley is determined to be a source of information, help, and guidance while we face this virus. Please reach out if you have any questions about our response or if you have any feedback on what else our team could be doing.

Did you see Katie Porter's email about Harley yesterday? Check it out below! Katie and Harley teamed up to make sure Postmaster General DeJoy was up to the job -- and he didn't even know some of the most basic elements of the USPS. If anyone knows how to ask tough questions, it's Katie Porter. And, the truth is, Harley will always be ready for the hard questions. As a member of Congress, it's exactly what he expects. But, he's also in one of the toughest re-election races in the entire country, which is why he really needs your help. Can you chip in a few dollars to keep him in Congress? Thank you! \-- Alyssa, Campaign Manager \---------- Forwarded message --------- Some of you probably saw Harley and me questioning Postmaster General Louis DeJoy about the USPS on Monday -- and you probably also saw how flummoxed he was by some of our most basic questions. Our elected and appointed officials should know their jobs inside and out -- that's what taxpayers pay us for. As one of my neighboring members, I know Harley well. And, I know that when I question him about what's happening to small business owners in Costa Mesa or how climate change is affecting our Orange County beaches or how the district is handling the coronavirus response, he knows exactly what's going on. We need to keep leaders like that in the House. That's why I'm asking if you can donate to Harley's campaign today? We're less than 70 days from Election Day, and Harley is in one of the most competitive races in the entire country.

Hey -- I just wanted to make sure you saw Harley's email from earlier today. Republicans are set on taking this seat back from Harley. The Congressional Leadership Fund is spending dollar after dollar on ads that are just not true. Reince Preibus just donated $1,000 to our opponent. And, on the whole, the Republican Party and the NRCC are pouring more money into our opponent's campaign than any other challenger this cycle. So, I've really got to ask: can you help us protect this seat from the Republican Party by donating today? Thank you! \-- Alyssa Napuri, Campaign Manager \---------- Forwarded message --------- Look, they've crossed the line. This entire election cycle, my opponent has been backed by the full force of the Republican Party. She's a Trump advisor. She's been endorsed by Newt Gingrich and Republican House Leadership. And she’s received more money from the Republican Party and NRCC than any other Republican challenger this cycle. Now, they’ve gone too far. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, has been airing blatant lies about my tax returns. Let me be clear: Unlike our President, I have always paid my fair share of taxes. I need your help getting this message out to voters. Can you donate to our campaign right now to make sure Republicans don’t win this election because of their lying television ads? My campaign is funded by donations from everyday folks like you -- and that's because I refuse to bow down to corporate interests or super PACs when I’m in Congress. But that means that when my opponent starts funneling money into spreading lies about me just two weeks from Election Day, I rely on you to fight back. That’s why I’m turning to you: can you help me fight back by donating today? Let’s keep this seat blue! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Harley just cast his vote to impeach the President. This was not an easy decision for him -- impeachment should never be an easy decision. But, ultimately, it came down to the fact that the President jeopardized the very tenants upon which our country was founded. That's why we're so proud to work for Harley: he makes decisions based around what he thinks is right, not around what might give him a leg up in the race. And that's also why we're asking if you'll donate just $10 to Harley's campaign to keep him right where he should be: in the House defending our Constitution and fighting for the people of Orange County. Harley says and does exactly what he believes. And that is exactly what makes him such an effective representative. Will you donate to his campaign so that Harley can keep on defending the American people every step along the way?

To finish off this quarter, we're joining with some of the most vulnerable California Democrats in a major final fundraising push. This quarter deadline is one of the most important ones of the entire cycle, so hitting our goal is more important now than ever. Will you help us meet our goal by donating today? These next two years will determine how our government handles the coronavirus, how our economy rebounds after this lockdown, and how our nation becomes more racially just and equal. That's why it's vital that we keep our California Democrats in the House. Will you help us do that by donating to the Keep California Blue fund today?

Hi there -- it's Kaira, Harley's wife. I'm just reaching out to see how your Halloween is going and tell you a little about ours. This Halloween is a bit different than years past: our kids are grown, trick-or-treaters will be sparse, and Harley's election is in just three days. But, truthfully, it feels like a scarier Halloween than any I ever remember having. There are so many things at stake for this election, both in CA-48 and across the country, and truthfully I feel scared of what will happen if people like Harley's opponent are elected. So, this Halloween, I hope you can enjoy the holiday's spookiness and also help us end the real spookiness on November 3rd by donating to Harley's campaign. Can you do that? I've seen Harley's opponent put people's lives on the line during this coronavirus crisis, and it's honestly terrifying. She's supposed to be leading our county as our top official, yet she's going to maskless events and began this pandemic implying masks could be dangerous. It's hard seeing Harley with those same fears for our district and knowing that there's a real possibility his opponent could unseat him and take her policies and beliefs to the Capitol. I want to make sure that doesn't happen. Can you help me by donating to Harley's campaign today? Thank you and happy Halloween! \-- Kaira Rouda Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hi! It's Nicole, Harley's finance director. I'm just emailing you because we need your help if we're going to hit our end of the month fundraising goal. With the election only months away, we're extremely aware that not only are we running in one of the most competitive districts in California, but we're running against one of the most well-funded campaigns in the country.

If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Harley is the only Democrat who has ever held this seat -- and he's been one of the most legislatively productive freshman members since taking office.

1\. I'm so proud of how my team has stepped up to serve our community in this crisis. We've used this campaign's resources to collect PPE for frontline workers in Orange County and raise tens of thousands of dollars for groups doing crucial work. 2\. Even while doing all of that, we're still running a very strong re-election campaign in a very tough district. In fact, before our win in 2018, a Democrat had never won CA-48! 3\. These last few months have made it so painfully clear that we need leaders in office who will put the needs of the communities they represent above political interests.

Hi! Harley's field team here. We wanted to follow up on Harley's email (forwarded below) to see if you can help make some calls for Christy? What we do between now and Tuesday could decide whether Christy wins or loses this election. Every single conversation with a potential voter matters. That's why we're asking if you'll consider signing up to volunteer for Christy's team today? The Republicans are gunning for this seat, and they're giving everything to show their strength before November. That makes it even more important that we share Christy's message with CA-25 voters and let them know that it's more important than ever to hold on to this seat. Will you sign up to volunteer with Christy Smith's team? Thank you! \-- Harley's Field Team \---------- Forwarded message --------- To our north in CA-25, Christy Smith is in a neck and neck race against a Trump enthusiast who's cozy with Big Money. The election will be decided this Tuesday. This seat was firmly red for over two decades before Democrats flipped it as part of the Blue Wave in 2018. Now, the Republican party and its Big Money allies are pouring money into ads in the district to try to take the seat back. Christy really needs our help. Will you donate today to show the Republicans that this seat is staying blue? Flipping CA-25 was part of the historic Blue Wave that flipped seven Republican stronghold seats across California, including my seat. I know that the NRCC is aching to take back these seats, so it's all the more important that we send them the message that we're here to stay. Will you help me send that message by donating to Christy today? Thank you! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Our campaign is dependent on everyday folks chipping in small amounts to our campaign -- it's what makes Harley untethered to Big Money and lobbyists and able to serve the interest of Orange Countians. And $5 is enough to make a huge difference in this election. Can you donate that? Take Rhett Buckley. Even after losing a campus job due to COVID-19, Rhett opened his wallet and gave us $5 -- it's stories like Rhett's that make us so proud to be part of a grassroots campaign. Check it out ⬇️ Shunning Big Money means that Harley can do what he knows is best for hardworking folks in the district without worrying about whether lobbyists will like it.

We're living through one of the biggest health crises of our lifetimes -- it can feel overwhelming, devastating, and all-consuming. However, one way that helps me combat a sense of powerlessness is to take intentional, tangible actions each day that do just a little bit to help our community deal with the crisis.

That's why I'm hoping that you might join me and contribute to these local Orange County nonprofits if you are able >> Meals on Wheels Orange County, OC Food Bank, Project Self-Sufficiency, Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County, and the OC Community Resilience Fund are all organizations in Orange County that are trying to make sure everyone in our community is taken care of and fed.

Hey there -- I just wanted to see if you saw Alyssa's email from yesterday (forwarded below). I've been asking my opponent to join me for a debate for weeks now, and she hasn't said anything about it. Debates are a critical way for voters to see where candidates stand on issues and how they differ from each other. And debates don't end with the campaign -- they're a major part of my duties on Capitol Hill. That's why I'm shocked that my opponent won't even acknowledge our request -- and we can be pretty sure that she's gotten the message. Can you join me in calling on Michelle to join us for a debate? Thank you! \-- Harley \---------- Forwarded message --------- Harley's asked his opponent for a debate. In several different ways. And multiple times. Her campaign still hasn't said a thing about it. We sent another letter to her team today letting them know that Harley's going to be available on August 30th at 6pm in Newport Beach for a debate -- whether or not she decides to actually come debate him. This is where we need your help: will you sign on to our petition to urge Michelle to show up for the debate? Our elected officials are expected to debate. That's just part of the job description and why it's so surprising that in the midst of many crises and with fewer than 75 days until the election, she's remaining completely silent.

Hi there -- I'm reaching out a few hours before our critical end-of-quarter deadline to let you know why your donation right now will go such a long way. We're in one of the most competitive districts in the entire country. In fact, our 2018 underdog victory was the first win by a Democrat in the district ever, and there are more Republicans in this district than Democrats. It only makes sense that POLITICO calls our race a "toss-up," and Inside Elections has named it the most competitive in Orange County. We're also in one of the most crucial times of the campaign. Voters will receive their mail-in ballots in just days, so now is our chance to share my message with undecided voters. And the consequences of this race will reverberate throughout Orange County. My opponent is threatening the ACA, women's rights, LGBTQ equality, and gun control. So, when I say that your donation right now is really important, I mean it. Can you donate today? I really appreciate your support! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hi, A few weeks ago, I asked if you would consider donating to some of our local Orange County organizations that are doing their part to help fight the effects of the coronavirus. You answered with unmistakable force, allowing us to collectively donate almost $15,000 to our local charities. With your donations, we can put food on the table for our recently unemployed Orange Countians. We can support our valiant health care workers who are risking their lives to protect ours. We can help our small businesses who are facing bankruptcy due to closures. As we face another week of sheltering-in-place and as we anticipate more coronavirus cases, I'm asking if you will once again consider donating to these charities?

We looked through every person who has ever donated to Harley's campaign, and we found that 1,708 teachers, 1,640 professors, and 1,351 physicians have given to Harley. That's just another reminder that while our opponent courts corporate special interests and dark money groups, Harley's appealing to everyday Orange Countians. Our end of the month fundraising deadline is tomorrow. Will you help us meet our ambitious fundraising goal to show our opponent our grassroots strength? Look, we have a big challenge ahead of us in November. That's why meeting these monthly goals is so important. Will you help us do that by donating now?

The OC Register just released a story called, "Coronavirus: For 23 Americans stranded overseas, getting home took an act of a congressman." Can you guess who that Congressman was? That's right, Harley was able to get 23 Orange Countians traveling across the world back home in the midst of this global health crisis. Will you read the story to learn more about how Harley did it?

Coronavirus is hitting us all hard, and small businesses are being affected by necessary social distancing. Right now, I'm working to make sure that our small businesses and their employees are protected in this time of uncertainty. Last week, I helped pass an emergency supplemental bill that allows Orange County businesses to access $7 billion in low-interest loans. I want to ensure that all business owners can actually use that money to protect their businesses and their employees. If you are a small business owner, check out more information on the program >> Please utilize programs like the Small Business Administration Disaster Loans. I will continue updating our community of resources at their disposal and fight to protect our small business owners and their employees.

Nicole from our team emailed you yesterday telling you that the NRCC just put Harley's opponent on their Young Guns list. That's a signal to everyone, including the gun lobby, to flood our race with dark money. Harley, on the other hand, is not a Young Gun and is not taking a cent from the gun lobby (or any other corporate special interest group). Rather, he was just awarded the 2020 Moms Demand Action Gun Sense Candidate distinction AND was just endorsed by Brady United Against Gun Violence and by Giffords: Courage to Fight Gun Violence. That's because Harley's working to protect our community and our children from gun violence, while his opponent is actively wooing gun lobbyists. The differences between Harley's views and that of his opponent could not be more disparate. It's critical we keep value-driven leaders like Harley in Congress.

Harley and Alyssa emailed you yesterday about Michelle Steel attending an in-person fundraiser without masks. We just learned this wasn't a one-off. Just a week ago, she took a mask-less photo at a major indoor event for the right-wing leader Charlie Kirk. Check out her individual picture when he was off the main stage ⬇️ Let us be the first to tell you: jeopardizing lives for photo ops and big checks is not good leadership. Frankly, it's wrong, dangerous, and just plain selfish. We can't let someone like that take CA-48. But, the thing is: if we don't finish strong in this final week, that might just happen.

My opponent, Michelle Steel, just announced she'll be calling on Newt Gingrich to help her fundraise. I'm actually glad to hear that. Newt Gingrich was the reason why I left the Republican Party in 1997. So, for her to choose Newt to headline a fundraiser only serves as further validation of how different our priorities are. While Newt and Michelle attempt to restrict rights for LGBTQ folks and take away a woman's right to choose, I am fighting to expand people's rights and promote equality for all Americans. Will you help send a message to Newt and Michelle by donating to our campaign today? As Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich changed Republican politics for the worse. Under his leadership, the GOP shifted from a party focused on small government to one which insisted on government influence over social issues. I knew that I couldn't be a part of the Republican Party when its policies became intertwined with disallowing LGBTQ folks from marrying, restricting women's right to choose, ignoring climate science, and vilifying immigration. People like Michelle Steel and Newt Gingrich will continue to make politics about taking away rights and exacerbating partisanship. I think we should be doing the opposite. If you agree, will you donate to my campaign today? Thank you for showing your values! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hi! I'm just emailing to let you know that Michelle Steel and Newt Gingrich cozied up for a Zoom fundraiser this week. I left the Republican in 1997 because of Newt Gingrich.

Michelle Steel's team just announced that they have $2 million dollars on hand. That's after Michelle Steel misled Orange Countians about the county's coronavirus response performance, after she implied humans shouldn't have to wear masks if dogs don't, and after a video came out of her making homophobic jokes. We've got a long way to go to combat Michelle Steel's war chest, and there's clearly a lot at stake in this election. That's why we have to ask if you can donate to our campaign today >> If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Express Donate: $25 Express Donate: $50 Express Donate: $100 Express Donate: $250 Express Donate: $500 Express Donate: $1000 Or, donate another amount With this massive quarter, Michelle Steel is now the biggest fundraiser of any frontline challenger in the country. With Big Money staunchly in her corner, we can't expect that to change anytime soon. That's why we need to come out strong right now to show Michelle's team that they're up against a massive grassroots team. Can you help us do that by donating today?

These last few months have tested our leaders -- and we've seen far too many fail. But, lucky for us, we have Harley representing us in Congress. From organizing a PPE drive in Orange County, to marching for Black lives, to simply wearing a mask, Harley has stood out for his leadership in this crisis.

Hi there -- I have been contacted hourly by healthcare professionals and first responders with desperate pleas for personal protective equipment. Some have even told me they're planning to stockpile trash bags in case they run out before supplies come in. I'm not going to stand by and watch our healthcare professionals -- and consequently our people -- suffer because bureaucracy and red tape is preventing us from getting the equipment needed to treat those with COVID-19. That's why I'm imploring individuals and businesses that can donate or manufacture gowns, face shields, masks (especially N95 or P100 masks), gloves, swabs, or other resources that could help hospitals during this difficult time. Please fill out this form if you can donate any gowns, face shields, masks, gloves, swabs, or other resources >> We can take action today that will make save lives and protect our community. So, if there is anything that you can do to help our healthcare professionals and first responders, please do it.

I'm with Harley: I'm nervous, folks. It's Election Day, and we know we're in for a race that won't be quickly decided. Just like the New York Times, the LA Times, and The Independent, Harley and I both know that this race is going to be as close as it gets. But, rather than twiddling our thumbs waiting on the results, we're going to keep on fighting to make sure we can keep reaching voters and hitting our budget goals. That's why I'm asking: can you donate $10 right now? Happy Election Day! \-- Alyssa Napuri, Campaign Manager \---------- Forwarded message --------- I've always known this is going to be a competitive race. No matter how long I'm in Congress, it will probably always be competitive -- because this is just a tough district to win in for a Democrat. But, newspapers all over the place, from the LA Times to the New York Times to even The Independent in the UK, are now reiterating that we're in for a nail-biter. So, I'm nervous. Especially because this race has huge consequences for people in Orange County and across the country. Can you help me secure two more years in Washington by donating today? We've got a lot on the line this election. Fundamental rights and basic safety could be stripped away if my opponent wins this race. So, I'm coming to you now, the day before Election Day, to ask if you can donate $20 to my re-election campaign. Can you donate today?

Hi there. Coming off another Election Day, I've been thinking a lot about how our campaigns are funded. So many campaigns are funded by special interests groups with ambiguous names and undisclosed donors, which makes it near impossible to track down where a candidate's support comes from. That's not the way we run our campaign, and that's not the way campaigns should be run. That's why on the 1-year anniversary of the For the People Act making its way through the House, I'm asking if you'll citizen co-sponsor the For the People Act >>> One year ago, I joined my colleagues in the House in passing the For the People Act. And now it's sitting on Mitch McConnell's desk where he refuses to take it up. That's why I need your help to tell McConnell that we want action on campaign finance now. Can you sign on?

It's a reminder of what our earth could look like if we continued to protect it from degradation. But, even now, our environment is continually under threat. Trump's EPA is using COVID-19 as an excuse to stop enforcing environmental protections. I'm calling on President Trump to protect our earth by continuing to enforce these essential environmental protections. Will you join me? We must protect our earth today, so our children and our children's children can enjoy it tomorrow. That's why it is so critical to tell President Trump that we can't stop enforcing environmental protections. Will you add your name if you agree? Thank you for taking action to help protect our earth, and, if you are able, I encourage you to go outside, practice social distancing, and enjoy all that the earth has to offer! Sincerely, \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress. In 2018, Harley defeated the 15-term incumbent Dana Rohrabacher in the very first political campaign of Harley's life. During his time in Congress, he's embraced common sense and values to tackle climate change, address deteriorating infrastructure, confront homelessness, and protect Social Security and Medicare. In 2020, Harley will be facing one of the toughest re-election fights in the entire country, so he's depending on the support of grassroots individuals.

We're only months away from Election Day, and every single thing that we do between now and then to support Harley could be what wins us the election. Showing your support for Harley with a sign on your front lawn is a huge step towards securing that victory. It's what shows your neighbors that Harley's backed by YOUR support. Will you sign up to receive a yard sign today? Here's the thing: yard signs are a cost-effective way for grassroots campaigns, like ours, to get our message out. So, we're also wondering if you would be willing to sponsor any number of yard signs? Just $10 could deliver yard signs to five houses throughout Orange County.

I know that this sounds like a gimmick, but it's true! Trump's been double taxing Californians, so Harley has a plan to fix that and return $4,000 on average to our pockets: he's cosponsored the Stop the Attack on Local Taxpayers (SALT) Act, which lowers state and local taxes for hardworking Californians. So, if you want to reclaim about $4,000, give this article a read and call on lawmakers to pass the SALT Act >>> Since taking office, Trump has been targeting California. That's why we need someone like Harley to stand up for our hardworking Americans. Will you donate now to Harley's re-election campaign to make sure he can do that?

In the midst of this health crisis, the EPA has stopped enforcing environmental protections. That means that our air, water, and lands have never been more vulnerable. This comes after the EPA announced that they would significantly reduce the amount of US waterways protected under the Clean Water Act, harming wildlife and polluting critical drinking water. We have to send a message to the federal government: our water protections are not up for negotiation. Will you add your name? The federal government is telling corporate polluters that they can do whatever they want during this period. That puts everyone at risk, including our residents who rely on clean drinking water and fresh air. Will you add your name if you agree that the EPA must protect our water and stop water protection rollbacks today?

Whoa. The Independent (yes, the news source in the UK that reports on all things across the entire globe) just made a list of seven of what they think are the "most interesting House races to watch on Election Night." Can you guess whose seat is one of the seven. Yes, they think folks better keep a close eye on our race on Election Day, and I'll tell you why: we could lose this seat. Harley won the seat in 2018 as part of the Blue Wave, but that was an anomaly. He was the first Democrat to ever win this seat in a district where Democrats are in the minority. So, we're going to have to come out as strong right now (if not stronger!) to keep this seat out of the radical right's hands. Can you help us do that by donating today?

A week ago, Harley came to me with a question: why are we waiting for our country to protect our healthcare workers and first responders when every moment during this crisis is critical? And a solution: let's cut out the bureaucracy and connect the people with personal protective equipment directly to the people who need it. Yesterday, he did just that. He brought thousands of gloves, hundreds of face shields, and twenty respirators to MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center, protecting the lives of our healthcare workers and all of the patients they care for.

President Trump openly admitted to blocking USPS funding to stop Americans from voting safely and securely. Let me repeat: the President of the United States of America publicly confirmed that he is actively sabotaging our right to a free and fair election. This is bigger than petty partisan politics; it is an attack on the foundation of our nation. This is a war waged on the bedrock principles of our republic -- the right to use your vote to make your voice heard and hold elected officials accountable. This is a "where were you and what did you do to stop it" moment in history. With the election right around the corner, I need your help to keep defending our democracy. Can you give now? I'll keep doing everything I can to protect our elections, including questioning Postmaster General DeJoy, supporting efforts to preserve USPS, and sounding the alarm -- but I need your help. The Trump Administration and complicit Republican members of Congress have sought to undermine our democracy -- but we need to show them that the power still rests with the people.

Harley's asked his opponent for a debate. In several different ways. And multiple times. Her campaign still hasn't said a thing about it.

I am absolutely speechless. Take a look >> It's hard to know where to start with this video -- but it's nearly impossible to deny that it shows just how deep Michelle Steel's homophobia runs. I am not okay with the possibility of our future Congressperson being so outwardly homophobic -- and you shouldn't be either. It could jeopardize some of our country's biggest LGBTQ victories. That's why I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that Michelle Steel does not take office. That starts with asking you if you can donate to Harley's campaign right now. Can you do that? Thank you! \-- Nicole, Finance Director Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Thank you. Monday marked our end-of-month deadline, and, with your help, we hit our fundraising goal. That means a lot -- especially right now. Hitting our goal this month means we'll have the funds needed to reach critical voters before Election Day, including the many Orange Countians who will be voting by mail before November 3rd. It also means that we have a solid base of fundraising that we can use to compete with our special interest-backed opponent. I don't take any of this for granted. I know that every single donation represents your belief in my ability to justly and fairly represent you in Congress. I truly hope to live up to that belief. So, thank you again for all of your support. I couldn't do this without you. Sincerely, \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hi! I know you're probably enjoying the last spooky hours of Halloween, but I couldn't let today pass without sending you a quick note. We're only three days away from Election Day, and if we don't have a huge fundraising weekend, we honestly could lose this election.

So, that's why I've got to ask: can you donate today?

We'll be honest: we know this is going to be a tough race, and the Republicans aren't going to make this easy for us.

There are harmful chemicals, called PFAS, found in everyday household items that could cause health issues ranging from cancer to infertility to impaired child development. And, while our communities are breathing in harmful toxins and drinking polluted water, Trump is doing absolutely nothing to protect us. That is terrifying, which is why I'm doing everything I can to make sure that we regulate these chemicals, clean up contamination, and protect public health. Will you join me? I introduced a bill to hold PFAS polluters accountable for their role in contaminating our water, air, and environment with these detrimental chemicals. And I also helped pass the PFAS Action Act of 2019. But we can't make any difference on ridding PFAS without action from the Senate.

Hey -- the election is in fewer than eight weeks, and we've got some updates for you: 1\. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican Super PAC, just injected over a million dollars to this race -- almost all of which is going directly to attack ads against Harley. 2\. The NRA just endorsed Harley's opponent and gave her an "A" grade, while giving Harley an "F." That's because Harley is going to go out on a limb to protect our students and communities from gun violence, even when it means being targeted by the gun lobby and the NRA. 3\. This race is still ranked a "toss-up" by POLITICO and named the most competitive race in all of Orange County by Inside Elections. That means we need your help right now.

Did you know that many cities across California didn't see a single day of rain in February? That's right, even in wetter places like San Francisco, rain just didn't come this year, setting the scene for a disastrous fire season, a diminished snowpack, and a record-breakingly hot year. And scientists are saying that this is just part of a larger trend: our dry years are just going to continue to get drier because of climate change.

Last week at the presidential debate, Joe Biden reminded us that we're not living with coronavirus, like Donald Trump would like us to think, we're dying with it. So, when my opponent, who is supposed to be overseeing our response to the virus, completely ignores medical guidance and holds an indoor fundraiser without masks, you can imagine my indignation. This isn't just a matter of breaking rules -- she's risking lives once again for no good reason. I refuse to let my seat go to someone who consistently puts the people she's supposed to be representing in danger. I'm going to fight every single day up until Election Day to make sure that doesn't happen. But, I need your help to do that. Can you donate to my re-election campaign today? Tomorrow marks just one week until Election Day. And I know I keep saying this, but I really cannot highlight it enough: we are not in a safe seat.

Michelle Steel has a lot of money on hand -- millions of dollars of it -- thanks to Big Money, the NRCC, and her own corporate salary (on top of the $1.7 million she's made off taxpayers while in office!). In fact, the NRCC is giving more money to Michelle Steel than to any other frontline challenger in the entire country. Just this quarter, they donated $200,000 dollars to her campaign.

I'm truly frustrated, folks, so I'm just going to get right to the point. Across the country, we've made huge sacrifices to fight the spread of coronavirus. College graduates aren't getting handed their diplomas, fourth graders are learning science on a computer, businesses are being closed -- sometimes permanently. But, somehow, our opponent, who is also the top official in Orange County, just decided to attend an indoor, mask-less fundraiser?! If you're as upset about this as I am, I encourage you to make sure she doesn't get the chance to represent CA-48 in Congress: donate now to our re-election campaign >> Let's do this! \-- Alyssa, Campaign Manager Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hi there, Throughout Orange County and the nation, the effects of the coronavirus have rattled our communities and revolutionized our conception of work. For some folks, that's meant responding to life-threatening emergencies every single day. For others, it's been teaching students over Zoom for the first time ever. And, for a lot of folks, that's meant being laid off and forced to search for work in a time of global economic uncertainty. In this context, Labor Day has a powerful and distinct meaning. It's understanding the role of labor in the context of our own lives, as well as its role in our communities. So, I hope you also put aside some time today to reflect upon how this pandemic has affected the jobs and livelihoods of people across our county and our nation. And, I also hope you spend some of your time enjoying the holiday and safely cooling off from the heat. Happy Labor Day! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Donald Trump came to Orange County yesterday, cheering on masses of people who took to the streets to see him and hosting a high-roller fundraiser despite COVID spiraling out of control across the country. Michelle Steel, who is supposed to oversee our response to this deadly virus, was absolutely silent about the president's visit. But, this is nothing new. She's said nothing in the face of countless Trump offenses. We need someone who will actually stand up for what's right, even when it goes against party wishes. That's why we need to re-elect Harley Rouda. Can you help us do that by donating today? We can't be all too surprised Michelle Steel didn't say anything about Trump's super-spreader event in Orange County. She's done this all too many times before! She was silent when Trump called our military heroes "losers," she said nothing when Trump tried to take away health care for those with pre-existing conditions, and she didn't say a thing when he said he was purposefully understating the coronavirus. We need someone to represent us who will actually use their voice. That's why I'm asking: can you donate to Harley's re-election campaign today?

Tomorrow marks 100 days until Election Day. Today, we're celebrating by calling folks across Orange County to tell them why they should cast their ballots for Harley. This is a big deal. It's our opportunity to tell everyone in Orange County that the difference between Harley and his opponent is stark and very significant. While Harley's defending Orange County families, Michelle Steel is putting out faulty coronavirus data and spreading damaging information about coronavirus. Will you join us for this Day of Action by signing up for a calling shift throughout the day? The two-hour slots include a 20-minute training, and you can make the calls from anywhere! If you can't make calls, there's good news: we're also setting an ambitious "100 Days Out" fundraising goal that we know you can help us hit.

Our end of the month deadline is tonight as midnight. Each of these deadlines leading up to Election Day is critical -- they allow us to show that our grassroots support will match every six-figure check Michelle Steel receives. When it comes down to it, we're facing someone who could easily have more money in the bank on Election Day than we do -- not because she has more support but because she's got Big Money on her side. But, we're going to do everything we can to try to match her fundraising each and every deadline. Can you help us do that by donating today? We're so proud that we're running a grassroots campaign. It means we're backed by the people Harley's serving. But, it does mean that we have to work that much harder to match the massive hauls Harley's competitor receives from Big Money.

As more and more people are contracting COVID-19 and increasingly strict quarantine orders are being issued, it is becoming absolutely clear that we must do everything we can to limit potential spreading of the virus. That's why California has been putting increasingly stringent caps on gatherings and why large events continue to be canceled. However, in just a few months, people across the country will be asked to congregate in masses to vote for the next president of the United States.

We all know who we look to when we want coronavirus guidance. Spoiler alert: it's usually not our president. Anthony Fauci has been our most reliable source of guidance on how to fight this pandemic since day one. And, we can't let Trump shuffle blame to him just to save face. Can you sign on to show Dr. Fauci that you're supporting him? Dr. Fauci has made sure to prioritize health and safety since the very start of this pandemic. In large part, he's why we've been able to save as many lives as we have saved. But, we all know Trump has been sputtering whatever guidance he feels like will benefit him on that day -- jeopardizing millions of lives across the country and contributing to the US having one of the highest death tolls in the entire world. We need to show Fauci he has our support. Can you do that by signing on today? Thank you for taking part! \-- Team Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

This week is expected to be one of the worst weeks of this entire coronavirus outbreak in the US. That means that our hospitals will be crowded with infected people, setting the scene for a massive shortage of personal protective gear. We can't let the people who are risking their lives each and every day suffer when we have a way to help them. President Trump has the authority to create enough equipment to stock our hospitals, but he's twiddling his thumbs and taking small steps rather than protecting all of our healthcare workers.

I won't sugarcoat it -- our final FEC deadline before the election is right around the corner, and we need your help to hit our fundraising goal. Unlike Harley's opponent, our campaign isn't funded by Big Money and corporate special interests. Instead, we rely on small-dollar donations from hard working folks like you.

Our race is one of the most competitive races in the entire country. In fact, Inside Elections even named it the most competitive race in all of Orange County. Hitting our ambitious goal this quarter will show Michelle Steel and her corporate interest allies that they can't buy their way to a seat in Congress.

There's reportedly a new ballot drop-off location at Michelle Steel's campaign headquarters -- the problem is that the ballot drop-off is illegal. That's right, an employee of the California Republican Party just told voters in CA-48 to go vote at "convenient locations," while standing in front of an unofficial and illegal ballot drop-off. That makes it seem like Michelle Steel is willing to go so far as to break the law in order to win this race. We're going to win this race fair and square, but we need your help to do that.

Last week, Michelle Steel spoke in front of the Orange County Board of Supervisors and argued that humans shouldn't have to wear masks because the CDC recommends that pets don't wear them.

Kamala Harris made history yesterday. She's the first woman of color to join the presidential ticket of a major party -- ever. And this is just the start. I know that once they take the White House, the Biden-Harris team will continue to break through barriers and make historic leaps every chance they get. But, I also know that they're up against a self-proclaimed billionaire opponent who doesn't play by the rules.

Tomorrow marks 80 days until Election Day. And we are still in one of the most competitive races across the entire country -- against an opponent who's risked lives with her coronavirus guidance, who's publicly made homophobic jokes, and who's standing by Trump at every move. That means these next 80 days are a sprint, and we need to lay it all out on the table. Unlike our opponent, who's raking in big checks from megadonors, our campaign is dependent on everyday folks like you who show that they care about who represents their interests in Congress.

Hi there -- I just wanted to follow up on Alyssa's email (forwarded below). I was shocked to read the article she mentioned in the Voice of Orange County. My opponent has made some ridiculous comments about coronavirus, like when she said it was "species discrimination" that humans have to wear masks even though dogs shouldn't. However, I was incensed that she would downplay coronavirus numbers and seemingly deceive the public on how coronavirus has impacted our county. We must ask for more from our public officials and demand transparency from those in charge of our county's response to the crisis. I'm asking if you'll donate to our campaign today because I will strive to be as open and honest as I can be -- and I hope you'll always hold me accountable to that. Can you donate today? Thank you! \-- Harley \---------- Forwarded message --------- Since the start of this pandemic, our opponent, Michelle Steel, has been overseeing Orange County's response to COVID-19. At best, her performance has been haphazard; at worst, it's been dangerous. Now, she's making completely false claims about how she's handled this crisis and how her response stacks up to the rest of the state. It's just adding insult to injury. Will you take a few minutes to read about how Michelle Steel misled the public on her coronavirus response? In the midst of a global health emergency that has claimed the lives of thousands of people, falsely buffering your county's statistics is more than just inaccurate -- it's morally reprehensible. It also shows how important it is to elect someone who will tell the truth, even if it doesn't make them look good. I know Harley is that leader, but we need your help to send him back to Washington. Will you donate today to help us re-elect him? Thank you! \-- Alyssa Napuri, Campaign Manager Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

An unprecedented health crisis calls for unprecedented action: schools are closed across the nation, sports seasons are proposing unheard of adaptations, and movies are premiering straight on TV -- all to prevent the further spread of coronavirus. But, the Senate is refusing to declare this an emergency, which would allow any voter to vote by mail. Not only is this an emergency, but also it's an emergency that requires we remain at home for our safety and the safety of those around us. Harley's calling on the Senate to pass the Natural Disaster and Emergency Ballot Act of 2020 to make sure Americans can vote safely. Will you join him? This bill will make it much easier to safely vote from home, securing a more fair election and stopping the spread of coronavirus in crowded polling places. This bill just makes sense. Will you show your support for it by adding your name today? Thank you for taking action! \-- Team Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress. In 2018, Harley defeated the 15-term incumbent Dana Rohrabacher in the very first political campaign of Harley's life.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce just endorsed one member of Congress in Orange County. Can you guess who that was? That's right -- the Chamber just backed Harley with their full support for his economically-savvy and business-forward policies.

Will you donate to our campaign today to re-elect him? With our economy hanging in the balance and our government facing difficult business decisions, we need leaders like Harley to guide our decision-making.

My opponent is in charge of making sure Orange Countians are safe from the novel coronavirus. Yet, she's mocking the idea of wearing masks as unsafe and "species discrimination." Masks, to me, make complete sense. In fact, I just wrote an Op-Ed about how masks will allow us to reopen our economy, restore jobs, and return to everyday life. I'm on the side of Orange Countians, and I promise to keep fighting to protect Orange Countians. Will you donate now to help me continue to serve all of you?

We know our opponent has told her fair share of lies during this campaign. But, she's now attacking Harley for not paying taxes (which is false) by using a business owner who owes over $25,000 in taxes. That's right. The mega TV buy they're pouring their money into attacks Harley for something he did not do by using someone who did the very thing they're accusing Harley of. That's crossing the line. I'm here to set the record straight: Harley has paid his taxes. The guy in Michelle Steel's ad has not. Check it out >> With only 18 days until Election Day, we know our opponent is going to pull out every trick in her hat. But, you and I both know the truth: Harley's a public servant who will stand for what's right.

Our seat is one of the most competitive in the entire country. In fact, Harley's win in 2018 was the first Democrat win in this district ever. Seriously. Now, the radical right is coming after Harley with everything they've got. And, that's probably because they think they can win back this seat -- and, honestly, for good reason: Democrats are in the minority in this district. Will you watch KTLA's clip about just how competitive this race is and then donate to help us keep this seat blue? With only ten days until Election Day, what we raise right now could make the difference between whether we win or lose this race. We know the radical right is chomping at the bit to get this seat back, which means that it's up to us to show them that their big dollar checks can't win them this election.

Last night, Harley debated... an empty chair. You heard that right. He went to debate his opponent, and she never showed -- calling the debate biased because a local Democratic group wanted to have a watch party of the event. The truth is: Michelle Steel has been ignoring attempts to hold a debate for weeks. From our standpoint, she was just looking for an "out" from this event. We need leaders who will be accountable to voters by actually engaging in thoughtful, fair debates before the election. Will you donate right now to help us elect Harley? Harley's in Congress because he wants to include your voice in our country's most important issues. And, he knows that one of the best ways to show you that he'll do that is through a live, moderated, and fair debate with his opponent.

Hi! This quarter had to be a big one to show the NRCC, corporate special interest groups, and Republican megadonors that we're not giving away this seat without a fight. I couldn't be more excited and thankful to say that you all helped us reach our fundraising goal! That puts us on a trajectory to match our opponent's war chest and make our case to voters come November. Thank you. I'm going to level with you: we have a tough next four months ahead of us. POLITICO ranked our election a "toss up" and Inside Elections named it the toughest race in all of Orange County.

Hi -- it's Harley's campaign team, and we just wanted to let you know that Harley's Republican challengers have already started attacking Harley in their fundraising material. Their campaigns, backed by Big Money, have outraised us in the last two quarters using shady tactics like this one. We want to come out hard behind Harley this month to show Harley's opponents that the people of Orange County are going to make sure that we don't go anywhere. Will you help us do that by setting up a recurring donation to Harley now? Harley's opponents may have war chests of special interest money behind their campaigns, but we know that our grassroots strength will propel us to victory. Will you commit to a recurring donation to help us show Harley's challengers just how strong our campaign is?

In 2018, I was part of a wave of frontline Democrats who won back seats that had been in Republican hands for decades. Now, we are all facing Republican challengers backed by deep pockets who have targeted our districts. That's why we're standing together to show them, the NRCC, and big corporate PACs that we're not leaving without a fight. Will you help us fight back by donating to our Keep California Blue fund? My race was just ranked by POLITICO as a "toss-up." And my colleagues' races aren't looking surefire, either. That means the GOP campaign arm is going to dump cash into our challengers' races. That's why we need your help to level the playing field and show that we can match anything they throw at us. Will you help us do that by donating to our Keep California Blue fund?

Hi there! Did you see Nicole's email about this quarter? It's a really big one for us because it's one of our final chances to show how many grassroots supporters back Harley before the November election. Especially after a new rating indicated that Harley's race is the most competitive in Orange County, these fundraising numbers are very important. Will you help us bring in record fundraising hauls this quarter by donating to our campaign today? Thanks! \-- Rouda HQ \---------- Forwarded message --------- Hi there. June is our second to last chance to post the kind of end of quarter numbers that will silence the NRCC once and for all. A new rating just showed that our race is the most competitive in all of Orange County. That's a sign to the NRCC that they should jump straight into our race and try everything they can to flip it red. Our best bet to fend off these attacks is to post record high end of quarter fundraising numbers. Will you help us do that by donating to our campaign today? I'm just going to say it bluntly: we need a huge fundraising showing this June. With the election just months away, hitting our target this end of quarter is non-negotiable. That's what will show the NRCC and the massive special interests that we're not going anywhere. Can you donate now to help us reach our ambitious June fundraising goal?

Harley's vote to impeach the President of the United States will not be about party, polling, or politics. It will be about the President abusing his power, jeopardizing our bedrock principle of free and fair elections, and failing to uphold his solemn oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. And that's exactly what Harley stands for: representing the interests of the people of Orange County -- not catering to partisan politics or special interests. But, for him to keep doing that, he needs your help >>> We've seen some politicians make decisions like these based on how many votes they think it'll earn them. But Harley doesn't vote based on how it'll benefit him, he cares about how his vote will affect his community. So, he's casting his vote to impeach this president, and he will continue to vote in line with his morals and for this community.

Hi there. This Fourth of July probably feels quite different than other ones you've had before. There won't be mass gatherings, big fireworks shows, or parades full of folks from your town. But, I encourage you to spend some time thinking about the founding of our nation: the freedom that the colonists fought for from the British -- freedom that only included some Americans. Today, we're still working towards freedom. And, I'll work tooth and nail to continue expanding freedom for every single American. This Fourth of July, let's remember these words: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." On this day, and every day henceforth, let's commit and recommit to America's ideals of equality, liberty and justice for all. Happy Fourth! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

2020 is on track to be one of the warmest years in recorded history. Globally, we had the hottest January ever recorded, and it didn't rain once in cities throughout California in February. Those are records we don't want to be breaking, but it looks like President Trump is leading us on that trajectory. That's why I'm backing a climate plan that prioritizes aggressive climate action by creating new green jobs, re-joining the Paris Climate Agreement, and investing in renewable energy technology. Will you join me? Here in Orange County, we see the effects of climate change every day: from rising sea levels to unseasonable heat waves to horrific fires. The only way that we can begin to reverse climate change and protect our society, economy, and environment for generations is to take bold action today. That's what I'm doing. Will you join me?

Michelle Steel is the one in charge of our county's response to the coronavirus outbreak. This is what she just said about wearing masks ⬇️⬇️ That flies in the face of scientists' recommendations.

Hi there. I just wanted to reach out because tomorrow is our end of the month fundraising deadline. I'm so proud of the grassroots campaign we're running, but we're up against Big Money, the NRCC, and a competitor who's writing herself six-figure checks. That makes it all the more important to have strong showings each month that represent our broad network of grassroots supporters. Will you donate today to help us reach our grassroots fundraising goal this month? In CA-25, we just saw a seat we flipped in 2018 fall to a Trump-backing Republican. It was historic that I was elected last election cycle, but I can't take it for granted that I'll be re-elected this year.

Hi there -- I just wanted to check in to see if you saw the email that Harley sent around yesterday? This moment is far too important to let partisan politics divide us -- and, friend, we're proud that Harley always prioritizes Orange Countians, that he truly cares about our community. We hope you will consider joining him in supporting any of the amazing charities listed below. On Team Harley, we're still committed to doing everything we can to win this election in November. But this won't be possible without you. If you are able (and we really mean that), will you consider pitching in to help re-elect Harley? With gratitude, \-- Nicole \---------- Forwarded message --------- We're living through one of the biggest health crises of our lifetimes -- it can feel overwhelming, devastating, and all-consuming. However, one way that helps me combat a sense of powerlessness is to take intentional, tangible actions each day that do just a little bit to help our community deal with the crisis. If we each do just a little bit (or a lot!) to help those in need, our community will get through this crisis stronger and more smoothly. That's why I'm hoping that you might join me and contribute to these local Orange County nonprofits if you are able >> Meals on Wheels Orange County, OC Food Bank, Project Self-Sufficiency, Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County, and the OC Community Resilience Fund are all organizations in Orange County that are trying to make sure everyone in our community is taken care of and fed.

Since the get-go, our opponent has made it crystal clear she has no interest in debating Harley -- even though that's one of the most important ways voters get to know what the candidates stand for. We're left grasping at straws why she's not giving Orange Countians a chance to see her take on some of our most pressing issues. But, Seinfeld's Jason Alexander helped moderate a "debate" between Harley and Michelle, using her previous statements about critical questions. We think it shows you just how important it is to make absolutely certain Harley's elected in five days, but we'll let you be the judge. Will you watch the clip and then donate to our campaign? Michelle Steel has spread dangerous anti-mask rhetoric, promoted homophobic views, and wants to repeal the ACA. You can even hear it for yourself in our "debate"! Let's be clear: these are bigoted, dangerous statements. And they aren't for the good of California's 48th district. They're good for the radical right and its special interest allies.

With your help, Congressman Rouda defeated Russia's favorite candidate, Dana Rohrabacher, in 2018. Now, a Wall Street Journal article has named Shawn Steel, of Shawn Steel Law Firm (where County Chairwoman Michelle Steel works and makes $325,000 on top of the $1,700,000 she's made off taxpayers during her time in office), as one of the key individuals involved in a pay-to-play scheme to connect Chinese Communist Party leaders with President Trump. Perhaps Michelle Steel isn't involved in her husband's attempts to compromise our national security and elections. But then why did she not even respond when Harley called upon her last year to join a pledge denouncing foreign interference in U.S. elections -- what are she and her husband hiding? It's time for Michelle Steel to denounce foreign interference in our elections once and for all. Will you join us in calling on her again to protect the sanctity of our free and fair elections?

Hi -- I want to make this brief and to the point: we really need your support today. Here's why: 1) There are 99 days until Election Day! That means we need to increase our fundraising right now. 2) Our end of the month deadline is Friday. Hitting our monthly fundraising goal will send the message that Harley's not going to back down. 3) Harley's opponent, Michelle Steel, brought in over $1 million last quarter. With Big Money, the NRCC, and her own deep pockets all funding her campaign, we can expect that she'll keep having huge fundraising performances. What do you say: can you give now?

How we respond to this moment matters Investing In Our Future To Overcome Our Present Our country has been battling a healthcare crisis and a growing wealth inequality crisis for decades. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated ## Investing In Our Future To Overcome Our Present Our country has been battling a healthcare crisis and a growing wealth inequality crisis for decades. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated the growing inequalities with millions now unemployed, losing their health coverage and struggling to pay bills while our country is at its most vulnerable. The delta between the haves and have-nots has been put on full display for the world to see. How we respond in this moment will define our children’s generation. We have an opportunity to change the trajectory and save our planet. We just have to take it. Going back to the way things were is not an option because the way things were wasn’t working for the majority of Americans. We can, however, meet this moment with bold common sense action, centered around all people and prioritize the safety and future of our families. COVID-19 has made the case for single payer healthcare, stronger workers rights and a true living wage. These issues are the starting point for how we rebuild our country, but much more can be done. When we reopen our economy, we’ll need to jumpstart it with a robust plan that puts all Americans back to work, uniting everyone in common purpose. This is the time to tackle the existential crisis of our time. It’s time to enact solutions that will give the people a Green New Deal and save our planet. Saving our planet with solutions that create a new economy and protect frontline communities is not a radical idea. The Green New Deal is pragmatic in its approach and offers a solution that matches the scale of the problem. We have less than 10 years to make drastic changes or face irreparable damage to our planet. We must shift to 100% renewable energy, rid our dependence on fossil fuel, and drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Half-measures and empty promises will not be enough. The toughest part about this transition will not be the mass behavioral change needed to accomplish it, but the elimination of anti-environmental lobbying. We must stop fossil fuel lobbyists and major polluters from buying inaction and deregulation. Every year, the world’s five largest publicly owned fossil fuel companies spend approximately $200 million on lobbying designed to control, delay or block binding climate-friendly policies. Long Island’s biggest polluter, responsible for the Bethpage Plume, has already donated over $3 million dollars to political campaigns for the 2020 election. Allowing corporations to destroy our planet for short-term profits jeopardizes our long-term survival. I am the only candidate in my race that has signed the No Fossil Fuel money pledge. A Green New Deal means a new green economy centered around frontline communities, job creation and saving our planet. Investing in our future will help us overcome our present and ensure a habitable planet for our children and grandchildren. The climate crisis is a national security threat, as it is the greatest threat to our survival. Stopping fossil fuel subsidies and leveraging our bloated military budget for funding will start us down the path of creating a sustainable planet. We can kickstart our economy by prioritizing funding for large-scale infrastructure projects centered on frontline communities that include affordable green housing, smart roads, solar and wind energy creation, water purification, and energy efficient transportation — and grow from there COVID-19 has shown us that Americans can rally and achieve incredible things when we are united in common purpose. Our future needs to be a priority. If we believe in solving our climate crisis, we must not support representatives who take money from the corporate polluters and anti-environment groups. We must demand a government who prioritizes the long term stability of our planet. A Green New Deal is our promise to our children that we are fighting for them. We cannot let them down. I am the only candidate in my race that has signed the Sunrise Movement’s Green New Deal pledge to fight for a Green New Deal. ## Support a future where we come first I’m rejecting corporate PAC donations because my policies can’t be bought by corporate lobbyists. Every dollar helps keep our people-first movement going. MAKE A CONTRIBUTION #### Please stay safe, staying home if possible, and social distancing if you absolutely need to go out.

Much is at stake, as the country is not in great shape. It’s vital that this election be transparent and fair, and that everyone who is legally entitled to vote in November can do so and do so safely." Donate to our GOTV Fund ➜ Hi Team, Sri emailed you yesterday about our new plan to Get Out the Vote this fall, as it looks increasingly likely that we will be continuing social distancing into the weeks leading up to November. We know voting in this year’s election will look different than it has in the past, so we need to make sure that we’re prepared to help voters cast their ballots, no matter the circumstances. The data is clear, team: If we achieve a record turn-out in TX-22 in 2020, this district WILL flip blue. Can you make a donation to our GOTV fund to help Sri and our team ensure that not even one voter sits this election out because they are afraid or don’t have the information to vote? >>> TX-22 has been named one of the top pick-up opportunities for Democrats in 2020. Last month we were named to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's prestigious Red to Blue list, and this month Cook Political Report singled our district out, proclaiming that Democrats “have a good chance” of winning this seat! Sri’s message is catching fire, team. Houston families are tired of political grandstanding and do-nothing representation. While our opponents compete in a race to the far right, Sri is focused on helping the community now and bringing common sense solutions that work for Texans to DC. We will win this election if we’re able to provide voters with the information they need to safely cast their ballots. Donate now to help us get out the vote and ensure commonsense leadership prevails in 2020!

Team, We’re faced with an unprecedented health crisis and we’re using our campaign platform to get the word out about staying safe and following the CDC’s recommendations for social distancing by canceling all in-person events and moving our organizing efforts online. This is especially important in our district which is one of the most diverse in the country, with many multi-generational families living under the same roofs. Please be mindful in practicing social distancing, especially with your family elders. We’re monitoring things on a daily basis, and will be sure to share any critical updates with you. We also remain committed to the work we have ahead of us to win in November, including raising the resources to continue getting the word out about the important issues at stake in this race: affordable healthcare, lowering prescription drug prices, and protecting Medicaid and Social Security. Our decisive win in the primary shows we have the support and the votes to win this race and flip our district. Help us bring science and common sense back to Washington. If you’re able, can you pitch in anything you can spare to help us?

Pollsters, pundits and political leaders are predicting that the path to a House majority for either party will run squarely through our district. Furthermore, Rachel Bitecofer, an elections analyst, proclaimed this week that “Losing a slew of House races in the heart of the Republican Party’s economic and political powerhouse…” would signal a permanent end to the conservative hold of the White House. But this is more than just another high profile campaign, team. This is about creating a path forward for all Texans and their families. While our Republican opponents continue their race to the bottom by making wild and outlandish statements in their party runoff -- our campaign remains focused on addressing the very real issues facing our community today. Fixing a broken healthcare system, solving our current economic crisis, and bringing common sense solutions to Washington are what Team Sri is all about.

Friend, Over the past few weeks our campaign has listened and learned from the narratives and experiences of Black communities across this district and nation. Resiliency, trauma, strength, collective spirit -- it pains me that decades after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, we, as a nation, have only just begun the process of truth and reconciliation. Understanding history is a part of this process. On this day, in 1865, over 250,000 enslaved Black Americans received word that they were declared legally free. After centuries of oppression, the resiliency and individual agency of Black America would not be denied. Whether in Congress or in statehouses around the south, Black political leadership grew, even in the face of constant threats. We should honor the offspring of enslaved Black Americans who have continued to provide light in times of darkness. Quite literally, Americans such as Lewis Latimer (invented the carbon light bulb filament) to Garrett Morgan (invented the three-light traffic light) have powered our society. Black history, black innovation, black agency - this part of our history does not get taught, and therefore, we must not let up the fight for justice. Juneteenth must serve as a reminder that, though emancipation is a cause for celebration, it also serves as a cause for reflection: the struggle for equal rights under law continues to this day. We must not fill these spaces with empty promises. We must continue to fight for equity in our criminal justice system with the understanding that Black lives matter. We must fight for equal access to education, housing, health care, and a fair economic system. Last week our campaign released Part I of our Civil Rights Act for the 21st century. We will continue to release subsequent parts in the coming weeks. This is my commitment to you, that I will fight to end racist and discriminatory practices against Black communities and people of color in our nation. Thank you, Dr. Pritesh Gandhi Dr. Pritesh Gandhi is a Houston born, first-generation American, Fulbright scholar, and physician. As a primary care doctor for the underserved, Dr. Gandhi has seen firsthand the critical need for expanded health care access that is both quality and affordable.

I can't express what that moment meant to me as a son of immig Friends -- Almost 12 years ago my immigrant grandmother voted for the first time as an American. She cast her mail-in ballot for then Senator Obama. I can’t express what that moment meant to me as a son of immigrants, as a native Houstonian, to see her on that rocking chair, in her pink housecoat, filling out that ballot for O-B-A-M-A. Her story was wrapped in complexities - lost her mother at a young age, fought mental illness most of her life, raised 4 children in a new land, struggled with diabetes. And yet, she was the most confident, matter of fact person I knew. Loved Marvin Zindler (Houstonians get this), the Houston Rockets, and her grandchildren - in that order. Her story is the American story. I’m on the ballot as a Democratic candidate for the US Congress in Texas’ 10th Congressional District. And like my grandmother, I won’t mince words. Our nation suffers because we lack diversity in DC, not just of race and ethnicity, but also of professional experience. I am a public service physician, lead a nonprofit health clinic, and have dedicated my life to working at the intersection of social justice, public health, and poverty. There is no guarantee of the outcome for the democratic experiment that defines America. But, my grandmother knew that her vote mattered. That in her vote, she had the power to hold this nation accountable to its founding values of justice and freedom. This is a moment in our nation’s history that calls for electing experts to leadership. I'm so grateful that all of you have been in this fight with our campaign over the past 18 months. If you haven’t gotten out and voted yet, now is the time. Polls are open until 7 PM tonight. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

When I launched Serve America ahead of the 2018 midterms, my goal was to elect a new generation of service-driven leaders to public office with an authentic commitment to their communities and our cou Team, When I launched Serve America ahead of the 2018 midterms, my goal was to elect a new generation of service-driven leaders to public office with an authentic commitment to their communities and our country. These public servants made our House majority possible, and they are leading the charge to expand and strengthen that majority this November. That’s why I was so proud to endorse Dr. Pritesh Gandhi in this primary season. The perspective and expertise he gained from a lifetime of service is exactly what we need more of in Congress. For the past four months, Dr. Gandhi has donned Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) every day and treated COVID-19 patients in his East Austin clinic. As the Associate Chief Medical officer of a non-profit, federally qualified public health center, Dr. Gandhi largely serves uninsured and underinsured members of your community who work in essential businesses—they’re cashiers at grocery stores, meat packaging workers, and day laborers. The patients Dr. Gandhi sees are your neighbors, and in many cases the thing that binds them together is non-existent or insufficient health insurance and inadequate access to health care. For the better part of two decades Dr. Gandhi has spent every day fighting to improve each and every community that he called home. And, in that fight, he has picked up the stories of the people he has fought for along the way— the man with pancreatic cancer who was repeatedly denied testing or the immigrant mother whose family lives every day under threat of deportation or the community fighting for access to clean drinking water. You can count on Dr. Gandhi to bring these stories with him to Congress next year, where he will cut through the partisan rhetoric to amplify the voices of the people we all aspire to serve. I’m proud to stand with Dr. Gandhi and eager to work with him in Washington, but I need your help to get him there. His runoff election is on Tuesday!

Hey friend - Did you get a chance to read yesterday’s email from Pritesh? As of today we are just one month away from our July 14th runoff and the stakes for this campaign have never been higher.

Senator Harris stands with Dr. Gandhi because he is a fighter for his patients and their families, but she needs your help to get him to Washington. Chip in now >> Friend, When I think of someone who is a fighter for the people, I think of someone like Dr. Gandhi. That’s why he’s earned my endorsement in this race. He is on the frontlines in the middle of a national pandemic treating COVID-19 patients at his nonprofit health clinic in East Austin. Dr. Gandhi knows his duty to his patients extends beyond the walls of the exam room. That’s why he has spent his entire adult life in public service. He has testified on paid sick leave at the Capitol, rallied for a women’s right to choose, and two years ago, led a movement of health care professionals at the border in Tornillo to stand up for those children separated from their families. He isn’t about ideology, he is about action. It’s why he started a group, “Doctors Against Gun Violence,” lectured around the nation on climate change and early childhood education, and has worked on initiatives ranging from microfinance for women-headed small business to micro-nutrient supplementation for children living in poverty. And, this November, Dr. Gandhi is going to be elected to the United States Congress, so he can continue to fight for his patients and their families. But, I need your help to get him there. Dr. Gandhi faces a critical FEC fundraising deadline at the end of the month and needs your support. Will you make a contribution to Dr. Gandhi today and send him to Washington so we can fight side-by-side? Dr. Gandhi is running to replace Congressman Michael McCaul. McCaul is an ardent backer of President Trump and an obstacle in the House to virtually every one of our priorities. Dr. Gandhi is the progressive fighter who can defeat McCaul in November and help make progress in Washington for working people. From paid sick leave and immigration reform to lower prices for prescription drugs and protecting a woman’s right to choose, I know Dr. Gandhi will be a champion for our shared values. I can’t think of anyone better to represent the TX-10 community, especially in the midst of this pandemic, than Dr. Pritesh Gandhi and that’s why I’m so proud to give him my endorsement. * * * Join Senator Kamala Harris in supporting Dr. Pritesh Gandhi for Congress by giving a donation now >> If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: GIVE $5 » GIVE $25 » GIVE $50 » GIVE $100 » Custom donation » * * * As a frontline physician and community health advocate, Dr. Gandhi has the skills to bring common sense reforms to Washington that will strengthen health care access for all families.

I like to think of myself as a pretty even tempered man, but right now I couldn't be more angry. Friend, I like to think of myself as a pretty even-tempered man, but right now I couldn’t be more angry. In the midst of this pandemic, as cases continue to rise each day in Texas, our state officials are moving forward with their lawsuit to repeal the Affordable Care Act. If they’re successful, 23.3 million Americans will lose access to health care -- including 2 million Texans. Sign now: Hands off the ACA >> It’s no secret that things are getting worse here on the ground in Texas. As a frontline physician, I can tell you firsthand that we’re nowhere near the end of this pandemic. The reckless steps taken by our state officials to reopen our state, without basic public health interventions funded and implemented, have created a surge in COVID-19 cases. Numerous Texas cities now lead the nation in rising COVID-19 cases, including several parts of our TX-10 district. Even this morning -- we received news that the Trump administration is pulling COVID-19 resources from Houston! Where are our Texas leaders, friend?? For Texas to persevere and get through this pandemic, we need elected officials who will prioritize the health and wellbeing of our citizens -- not the whims of corporations and special interests. As our state officials move forward with this lawsuit to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and begin briefings in court tomorrow, I will be fighting alongside you. I’m running for Congress because I’m sick and tired of seeing our politicians play fast and loose with the lives of Texans. You deserve representation that will put your health and safety first -- and that’s the campaign I’m running. If you have a moment, I hope you’ll join me by signing our petition to call out this dangerous lawsuit and the elected officials standing behind it.

We’re seeing record hospitalizations, ICUs in major metro areas are at or near capacity, and the problem is getting worse each passing day. Simply put, this is bad. Here is the thing, folks: It didn’t have to be this way. Our Governor here in Texas issued a mask order only yesterday, something that should have been done weeks prior. And earlier this week, our Lt. Governor openly bragged about ignoring Dr. Fauci. Given the poor leadership modeled by the federal government, why should we expect any different?

DO NOT INGEST TOXIC CHEMICALS Gandhi For TX Logo Ingesting Toxic Tweet Hello, As a trained public health professional and physician, it’s my responsibility to inform the public that there is absolutely no truth or scientific evidence to back Donald Trump’s idea that COVID-19 patients may benefit from being injected with disinfectants. But as a human being with common sense, I’m outraged that I would even have to state that in response to such flagrantly irresponsible and negligent statements from the President of the United States suggesting that patients be injected with toxic chemicals. Donald Trump has no regard for the dangerous consequences of his comments. Whether or not he tries to defend them as “jokes," there has been nothing remotely funny about Trump’s attitude and response to the COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed over 51,000 American lives. While healthcare workers continue to risk their safety every day to treat the coronavirus, Trump continues to ignore the advice of healthcare officials, including Dr. Fauci, who Trump has taunted and threatened to fire for not agreeing with his methods. The American public needs Dr. Fauci to counter Trump’s haphazard response efforts and ignorant misinformation regarding COVID-19. We must protect Fauci's job so that he can continue to give us the facts that will help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Sign the petition right away to help keep Dr. Fauci’s job safe >> SIGN THE PETITION Be well and stay safe, Dr. Pritesh Gandhi We have a lot of work to do before the runoff election, so we need your help to push us to the finish line.

Hey friend, Did you get a chance to read Dr. Gandhi’s email from yesterday? Honestly, I’ve never seen him more fired up than he’s been over the last couple days. As a physician, and one who particularly focuses his practice on helping our most vulnerable Texans, he’s absolutely furious at our state leaders for their dismissal of this public health crisis. More than just about anyone, Dr. Gandhi sees the real human impact of these shameful political actions in his clinic on a regular basis. I know that if we can bring him to Congress, we’ll finally be able to turn the tide on these bad actors. Will you help us get him there? We’re still $5,300 away from our end of quarter goal this Tuesday: [[URL REDACTED]] -Anna On Jun 27, 2020, at 11:27 AM, Dr. Pritesh Gandhi wrote: Friend, We’re facing a major crossroads internally with our campaign as we try to keep ourselves on the path to victory, but it’s nothing compared to what Texas is currently facing. Our leaders have failed us, friend. With COVID-19 cases rising at a previously unseen speed in our state -- our elected officials continue to miss (or ignore) the memo that it’s time to get serious about health care. After recklessly re-opening our state at a speed, our medical community warned against, they’re spending this week filing briefings to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and strip health care away from millions of Texans. I’m running for Congress because I can’t let our government continue to put our state at risk. If you’re with me, I hope you’ll consider giving to our campaign ahead of this quarterly deadline.

Friend, In just four days we will not only meet our quarterly deadline (our biggest deadline of the cycle!), but we’ll also officially be two weeks out from our July 14th runoff election. What happens in these next couple days will make or break this campaign, so I wanted to give you two scenarios that we’re looking at: We meet our end of the quarter deadline goal: If we make our quarterly goal, we will have the money in the bank to make the most of our final push to the runoff. That means fully funded ad plans and the ability for our GOTV volunteers to use the very best mobilization tools. With our final days fully fueled, we will be well on our way to winning on July 14th and flipping TX-10 blue in the November election. Help us win >> We don’t meet our quarterly goal: If we don’t meet our Tuesday night goal, we will be waking up on Wednesday morning to make cuts to our GOTV plans. Some of our ads will immediately need to be taken down, and our mobilization efforts will quickly be scaled back. Our ability to reach voters will take a massive hit. Donate >> Friend, our ability to win and send Dr. Pritesh Gandhi to Congress relies entirely on the motivation of our grassroots supporters. Pritesh cannot win without you. If you want to be with us for the long haul, I hope you’ll commit to a donation today so we can bring transformative leadership to Washington. Not only is Pritesh a celebrated doctor and advocate for our community’s most vulnerable -- he’s also recognized by the Austin Statesman as our best opportunity to turn this district blue!

Today, the Supreme Court issued a ruling stating that employment discrimination protections apply to LGBTQ+ individuals! This historic news now cements into law that people cannot be fired for being g Friend, Today, the Supreme Court issued a ruling stating that employment discrimination protections apply to LGBTQ+ individuals! This historic news now cements into law that people cannot be fired for being gay or transgender -- a crucial step forward in the fight for LGBTQ+ equality. But even with this historic ruling, gay and transgender people still face rampant discrimination. Just two days ago, the Trump administration reversed non-discrimination protections for transgender individuals seeking health care or health insurance coverage. In other words, health insurance companies can choose not to cover, and doctors can choose not to treat, gay and transgender people. SIGN: Tell Trump health care is no place for discrimination That is unacceptable. As a doctor, I believe that LGBTQ+ health care is health care \-- no exceptions. I’m proud to work at a non-profit, community health clinic designated as a LGBTQ+ Health Care Equity Leader by the Human Rights Campaign. I’m dedicated to fighting for equality in the care that all clinicians provide. The protections the law has extended to the workplace must extend to our health care system. That’s why I’m stepping up to demand that Congress fight back against the Trump administration’s health care equality rollbacks. And if you agree, I’m asking you to add your name and make your voice heard. >> Sign the petition June is Pride month. But while we celebrate the milestones that have propelled equality for the LGBTQ+ communities, we must recognize that the ongoing struggle for justice still continues.

We need to start preparing NOW for a safe and secure election. Team, This November, it’s important to make sure that no one has to choose between casting a ballot and keeping their family safe and healthy. In order to protect both our democracy and our communities, we need to start preparing NOW for a safe and secure election. It’s unfortunate (but not surprising) that Sen. Cornyn is refusing to take action. He says that if voters “can go to the grocery store they can go to the polls.” All 50 states, including Texas, already allow many people to vote by mail -- and with social distancing in effect across the country it’s not hard to see why it’s only common sense that we should allow everyone to do so now. DONATE TO DEFEAT SEN. CORNYN >> With The Hill reporting that Sen. Cornyn is facing his “toughest race yet,” it’s obvious why he doesn’t want more Texans to vote by mail. But Texans (and all Americans) deserve a senator who puts our physical health and safety ahead of self-interest. I’ve worked my entire life to do what’s right, from flying rescue missions in Afghanistan to taking on both parties and the Pentagon to open ground combat roles to women. That mission will continue in the Senate, and you can bet I’ll never put partisan politics ahead of Texans’ safety. But I need your help to win this race. If you’re able to do so, will you make a donation to my campaign today to help me defeat Sen. Cornyn this November and fight for ALL Texans in the U.S. Senate? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Express donate $5 >> Express donate $10 >> Express donate $25 >> Express donate $50 >> Or, donate a different amount >> Thanks, MJ Hegar DONATE It's clear we need a real leader for Texas and a Senate that prioritizes our health care.

With the election coming up quickly, I want to reach out and ask if you can donate to a candidate for U.S. Congress that I have known and worked with for more than 15 years, Stephen Daniel. Dear friend, With the election coming up quickly, I want to reach out and ask if you can donate to a candidate for U.S. Congress that I have known and worked with for more than 15 years, Stephen Daniel. During our time working together, I have been consistently impressed by his integrity, hard work and commitment to helping others. From fighting for justice for his clients to serving as a steward for his community, Stephen is one of the best we have. Stephen is emblematic of the common sense that we need to restore in Washington. He approaches every problem with a level head and works to find the best solution for everyone, not himself. He follows his moral compass, not the whims of whatever is easiest. He never ceases to do right by his clients, his family or his friends, and that’s what makes him a good man. Stephen is running in Texas's 6th Congressional District. This is a district we can win this year and I need your help to get it on the radar of the folks in Washington. Beto O'Rourke barely lost the district during his run for Senate in 2018 and the explosive growth of our area has made it even more competitive. Please join me in supporting my colleague and friend Stephen with a donation to his campaign today. You can click this link to donate.

While no block-walking is allowed... View this email in your browser Contribute # What Addison is doing amid Covid-19? With the COVID-19 virus among all of us in the USA, In District 83, The District I am running in for Texas House of Representatives, There have been multiple confirmed cases in Lubbock with thousands in surrounding counties around the South Plains and the Permian Basin. While I and my family are staying indoors, to help this situation, and campaigns at a standstill, with just digital campaigns being allowed, I wanted to reach out, and ask for your help during this time. Yes, my campaign still needs funding as there are monthly bills due, but in the end, I only care about helping others in the state. When our Texas Governor announced his Executive Orders during this year, I campaigned and sent responses back to him, and every legislator in office, with every single order, letting them know the concerns I have, and the people I have spoken with have on their minds. While Governor Abbot has done some good for Texas and communities throughout the state in the past, he has failed our state, and amongst them that has failed is my opponent in HD83, Burrows, who rushed to reopen Lubbock, who contacted Ken Paxton just to reopen gun shops, while thousands were unemployed and going hungry, who had a parade July 4th, with large crowds. Who is making it hard for cities and all county officials to do the job they are elected to do, especially during this time, only worrying about property taxes, when most people may not even be able to pay their rent, or house payment. The questions still remain, how do we proceed and how do we recover from this? What are we doing as a state to help these people? I have been campaigning digitally, and not going door to door this election, unlike what I did for the primary, which I won with 54% of the votes. and among this comes digital ads, direct mail mailers, and newspaper ads. This all comes at a price, and I'm running a very low budget campaign, especially since amid this pandemic, peoples pocketbooks ae worn thin, but we need this funding if we want to flip Texas Blue in November/ If you can just chip in anything you can afford, this campaign and continue to prosper and we can achieve our goal! # Remember as the days continue to go by, practice good hygiene and social distancing to avoid spreading or catching Coronavirus. * Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

Hi Alex, Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act. The bill would give Medicare the power to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies. With over 6 million senior citizens on Medicare, Californians would benefit greatly from this bill. In total, it’s projected to save the program $450 billion. And it’s not just Medicare recipients -- these savings would be passed on to all Americans, making lower-priced drugs more widely available. Will you join me in calling on the Senate to pass H.R. 3 so we can lower the out-of-control prices of prescription drugs? Sign the Petition In recent years, the out-of-control pricing on pharmaceuticals has been a severe financial strain on seniors and others. We’ve seen people going without life-saving medication and rationing their prescriptions. Alex, this is just wrong. That’s why I support H.R. 3. It’s time to bring some common sense back to our drug pricing, and ensure that no one has to go without medication they need to live. Although the bill has passed in the House, it now has to go to the Senate, where Mitch McConnell has already said he’ll refuse to consider it. So, we’re speaking out. We’ve started this petition to send the message that the American people are sick of pharmaceutical companies making life-saving drugs unaffordable. Will you join us? Tell the Senate to pass H.R. 3 and lower the out-of-control prices of prescription drugs.

Alex, With less than 40 days until the election (can you believe it?!), we're continuing to fire on all cylinders. We've got volunteers and interns making calls, delivering signs, and knocking on doors each and every day. If you want to get involved, please follow this link, and we'll get in touch! This week, we released our latest TV ad, "Promise." Colin Allred campaigned as "an independent voice for North Texas - not a party line politician." But he broke that promise as soon as he got to DC, voting with Nancy Pelosi 100% of the time. I know that sounds hard to believe, but it's a fact. I'm not a politician; I'm a businesswoman who will solve problems and help get people back to work. If you haven't watched this ad yet, you can check it out below. I also joined forces with Dan Crenshaw and a group of young, dynamic Texas congressional candidates to release "Texas Reloaded." This ad has been billed as the "greatest joint political ad of all time," and I'm truly amazed by all of the positive coverage it has received over the last few days. It was a ton of fun to work with this group of candidates who share my belief that we must defend our common sense Texas way of life from the progressive agenda. Check out "Texas Reloaded" below! I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed making it. Finally, as I touched on at the beginning of this email, we are remaining very active out in the community. Often that means masks and social distancing, but we've adapted to the realities of campaigning in 2020, and my campaign team will not be deterred. One of the events I went to this week was a candidate forum in Garland, that was held for members of the Vietnamese American community. I'm running to represent all residents of District 32, and I enjoy the opportunity to participate in events such as this. Our final quarter of fundraising ends in just a couple days, and it's critical that we report a strong number. So if you have been thinking of supporting our campaign financially, now is the time to do so. Thank you and I hope you have a great weekend!

# Right now, a bunch of Washington-based groups are pouring millions into Montana. They're running attack ads about my record that, to put it plainly, are just flat-out false. Here's the truth: As Governor, I've worked with Republicans and Democrats alike to get things done for all Montanans. We have expanded affordable health care, protected our public lands, and passed one of the strongest campaign finance laws in the country. If you can, consider donating to our campaign before tonight's important end-of-month deadline to help us overcome these attacks and win this race: If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $10 now Chip in $25 now Chip in $50 now Chip in $100 now Chip in $250 now Another Amount The thing is, working across party lines always just seemed like common sense to me. Why wouldn't we work with anyone and everyone who is interested in improving people's lives? But that's not how Washington works these days. Instead, it runs on big corporate interests and dark money. And these groups will spend whatever it takes to keep the wheels churning in their favor. I'm running for Senate to get big money out of our politics and bring a common-sense attitude to Washington. And with all this outside money pouring in, we're counting on donations from folks like you to win. That's why I'm asking: Will you pitch in whatever you can ahead of tonight's end-of-month deadline? We'll put your contribution to work right away building a winning campaign: If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $10 now Chip in $25 now Chip in $50 now Chip in $100 now Chip in $250 now Another Amount In this election, we have an opportunity to make a real difference in people's lives both here in Montana and across the country.

# When I decided to run for Senate, I knew it would be an uphill climb. The corporate special interests who have captured Washington for too long will spend any amount of money to keep their grip on power. And since I got into this race, that's exactly what they've done — to the tune of over $26 million on attack ads here in Montana. In my time as Montana's Governor, we've been able to look past the partisan food fights to bring people from across the state together around issues that matter to all of us. We've worked with Republicans and Democrats alike to expand affordable health care, protect our public lands and outdoor spaces, and pass one of the strongest campaign finance laws in the country. That kind of common sense is exactly what scares the big corporate interests into opening their wallets. They're spending big to stop us from bringing Montana values to Washington. We have just one week until our August fundraising deadline and our campaign isn't taking any money from corporate PACs. Instead, we're counting on contributions from people like you to reach our goal. Will you make a donation today to help? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $10 now Chip in $25 now Chip in $50 now Chip in $100 now Chip in $250 now Another Amount Washington is a place where talking about something has become a substitute for doing something. That's no accident. Big corporate interests spend millions to keep it that way. I'm running for Senate to change that and make real progress on the issues that matter to all of us — just like we've done here in Montana. Thank you for making this campaign possible.

When the Big Sky is your backyard, there are more interesting things for a kid to do. I made my pocket money the same way a lot of kids my age did: I delivered newspapers before school. It was while I was out delivering papers that I first saw the governor's house. If it wasn't on my route, I don't think I would have known it was there. But it was my love for the Big Sky that years later inspired me to run for public office in the first place. I know that there is something special and irreplaceable about this place we call home, and I've dedicated my life to protecting our Montana lands and values. Now, my wife and I are raising our kids in the same house I once delivered newspapers to. As Governor, I've worked with folks from both sides of the aisle to get things done for Montana. Together we've strengthened our economy, expanded access to quality healthcare, invested in public schools, and created job training and career opportunities for the next generation. And as Montana's next Senator, I will bring our Montana values — common sense, unity, family, and good old-fashioned hard work — to Washington, to get things done for working folks and families across the country. But I can't get there without your help. Our campaign is facing a big test in just a few days — our last end-of-month fundraising deadline.

Friend, With parents juggling working from home, remote learning, and the stresses of the pandemic, it's time to talk about safe firearm storage. One mistake could cost lives, and right now especially, we need to be doing all we can to keep families safe. While the coronavirus may have made this problem more immediate, unlocked and unsupervised handguns have been dangerous to families long before social distancing measures and will continue to be dangerous long after unless we take action today. Every day, 8 kids or teens are unintentionally shot because of easy access to a firearm. Demand Congress pass Safe Storage laws today >> SIGN HERE The Prevent Family Fire Act protects all our families, but as I'm sure you know, the NRA is doing everything they can to stop even common sense laws like this from passing. That's why I, along with gun safety group Brady PAC and many of my colleagues, are working to get 100,000 gun safety activists to stand with us in this fight.

Hi Alex, I am proud to support a fellow west coast conservative, Brian Maryott in his run for Congress in California’s 49th Congressional district. Brian is campaigning to win back a key seat in Southern California needed for the GOP to reclaim the House Majority on November 3rd. Brian is in a tough race against a radical opponent, Mike Levin. In Congress, Levin votes strictly on party lines siding with AOC and Nancy Pelosi over 99% of the time. And he is one of the most radical freshman members of Congress. I know that this district deserves better leadership and a common sense leader like Brian. It’s up to us, Alex, to send Brian Maryott to Congress. As a committed conservative, I know that Brian will defend law enforcement, protect and enhance our healthcare system, support our veterans, and ensure future generations can live out the American Dream. Alex, with just 17 days left until the most critical election of our lifetime, Brian needs our support now more than ever.

Brian is the common sense candidate in his race, and I look forward to working with him in Congress to secure our borders and protect our free-market principles.

Alex, Many hard working Americans are getting back to work, and leaders around the country must do the same, to ensure our small businesses have the resources they need to prosper. I know how important it is to get Southern Californians back on their feet. That’s why I was the first candidate to push for a safe, responsible reopening of our local economy and small businesses. As a Certified Financial Planner, I know firsthand what it takes to get people out of debt and on the road to financial success. We must take specific steps to help our economy recover in this critical time. The last thing our nation needs is more government regulations and bureaucratic policies. And Alex, my opponent Mike Levin, Gavin Newsom, and their radical allies support policies that are a major step backward for American workers and are drastically preventing economic growth coming out of this pandemic. Mike Levin, was silent on this reopening, mute on the struggle of local business owners, quiet on the long-term economic impacts of a prolonged shutdown, and silent on how Congress can help this economy recover. He supports plans that would increase taxes across the board and destroy American jobs. Worst of all: Levin supports repealing tax cuts that delivered wage increases to many Americans over the past three years. I know that many Californians are concerned about future generations, and I recognize that our nation needs common sense leadership and representatives who are willing to speak up and take action.

If you would prefer not to receive future emails, visit here. There are just hours left until Election Day! Alex, tomorrow is our last chance to finally chase the radical Rep. Mike Levin out of Congress and make room for a bipartisan, common sense leader. To do that, we all need to make a plan to vote. If you haven’t already mailed in your ballot, it must be postmarked by November 3rd, tomorrow. Or, if you plan to vote in person, make sure you know the location of your polling place. Voting is fundamental to our governmental process and it is a right we must never take for granted. It is time to return the House to the people and rid it of partisan games. That starts by defeating the partisan Mike Levin who is a staunch advocate for the most progressive policies presented by the socialists in his party. We have the power to change Congress for future generations and to clean up the D.C. Swamp from career politicians. All it takes is a vote to put an end to failed leadership and radical agenda items... We are so close to finishing this fight, Alex, and my campaign could not have made it this far without you. I know that Mike Levin’s agenda is too radical for Southern California and is not the right direction for our country. I have remained committed to exposing Levin’s partisan voting record, and I will never stop fighting for better solutions for our district. If you can spare just $5, $10, or $20, it will go the distance and help us finish this last leg of the race strong! Thank you for your commitment to our movement thus far and we hope you will get out and vote! See you at the polls tomorrow!

If you would prefer not to receive future emails, visit here. Alex, I have been so honored by the outpouring of support that I have received from across the district. The voters of Southern California agree that it is time to restore common sense leadership to our representation in Washington, D.C. Over the past several months we have been building strong momentum in this race, despite the radical left spending millions of dollars to spread hate across this district. In the face of their lies, I wanted to take a moment to remind you, Alex, of what I stand for. * Protecting our precious coastline and environment * Enhancing our world class healthcare to expand choices and lower costs * Ensuring a vibrant economy for everyone * Preserving the peace for current and future generations These are the things that I will stand for if elected. As a small business owner, I know that integrity and common sense are the two most important things we take to work with us each day, and I promise to bring both of them to work on your behalf as your next representative. I greatly appreciate the support you have given me so far, Alex. I hope that I can continue to count on it in the next few weeks ahead of November’s critical election. Thank you!

The end of September marks the most critical fundraising deadline that this campaign will have as we near November’s election. However much we raise this month will determine how many available resources we have for next month -- the last full month of the campaign before Election Day. This race is one of the most competitive in the country… but you already knew that. Pelosi and the Democrats know that Mike Levin’s seat is vulnerable, so they are flooding this race with millions.

Hi, Alex, With so little time left until November’s election, I wanted to take a moment to remind you what I am fighting for and what is at stake in this race. Since the beginning of this campaign, I have been working towards one goal: to bring common sense leadership back to Southern California on behalf of the people of the 49th congressional district. There is a lot of uncertainty in the world right now, from concerns about healthcare, to when we can expect our children to go back to school. In times like these, we need steady leadership, not a radical agenda. We need a candidate dedicated to improving our healthcare system, not trying to dismantle it. I am focused on protecting and enhancing healthcare here in Southern California as well as making sure that it is reliable and available for everyone. I believe all Americans deserve access to quality healthcare, but not through a socialized Medicare approach. I’m also running to make sure we apply a common sense approach to improving our environment. We are so fortunate to have the beautiful coastline that we do, and I want to make sure that we are protecting it so that our children and future generations can enjoy it. We can protect our coastline with pragmatic ideas — we don’t need to spend hundreds of billions of dollars reshaping our economy to do it. I hope that I can count on your continued support as we finish this race strong.

Because of your support,we now have the momentum needed to face Mike Levin and his warchest as we head into the final month before Election Day. Thank you! Alex, thank you for your continued support and commitment to our movement. My finance team told me that we met our fundraising goal late last night! Because of your support, we now have the momentum needed to face Mike Levin and his warchest as we head into the final month before Election Day. We have received overwhelming support in these last few weeks. I am confident that we are building the grassroots momentum we need to WIN back this seat and the House majority for the GOP. It’s hard to believe that after all this time, the election is just a month away. And Alex, let me tell you, the Democrats are ready to deploy even more money into this race to secure this seat for the radical Mike Levin. While Mike Levin may have millions of dollars from coastal elites, we have patriots like you in our corner. I am very grateful that our grassroots movement is activating to return this seat to common sense leadership. It is time we turn the tides and rid Congress of members like Levin who vote strictly on party lines and choose supporting special interest groups over the people they represent. Americans deserve leaders who are going to put their interests first instead of siding with radicals the likes of Pelosi and AOC. With such little time left until Election Day, your support has never been more important than it is today. So, I am asking once more if you will join my fight and make a donation of any amount so we can deliver a huge WIN in Southern California on November 3rd? DONATE TO MAKE AN IMPACT Again, thank you for your unwavering support and I hope to count on you as we press on to victory.

Less than 40 days to go! View this email in your browser ## Road to Victory: 36 Days Until Election! Dear Alex, With 36 Days to go until Election Day, I wanted to take a moment to give you some updates on our campaign. We will send out a campaign newsletter every week, to make sure you're "in the know". I'm asking you to trust me with your vote, so the least I can do is make sure you know what I believe in and what my priorities are as your Congressman. Last week, we released our latest ad, highlighting our coalition of students who support our campaign to restore common sense leadership to the 49th District. Our "Students for Maryott" coalition is a diverse group of young leaders who have had enough of progressive left policies in our country, so they decided to get involved in local politics. Check out the video here! As parents, we all know that there are a variety of factors that impact the potential for a child's future - we also know that few, if any have more impact than a great education. I've always believed that the path to the American Dream is through a quality education. As Congressman, I will work to ensure that our families and students have as much choice in their education as possible. It sounds simple enough, but the concept of choice in education, healthcare, and future economic opportunities for our young people is under constant threat from legislation proposed by the very hard left "progressives" - and while their heart may be in the right place, their ideas are naive and reckless. I will fight for our young children and their parents to have maximum access to choices in education. That will include support for charter schools, removing barriers to private school start-ups, education-related tax credits for lower income families, strong support for fair and equitable school vouchers, and strengthening district support for homeschooling. And yes we absolutely can and must do these things while continuing to strive for and maintain an excellent public school system. Don't let anyone ever tell you we can't give teachers and students choices without destabilizing the public school system! It is a defeatist and unacceptable excuse. Competition strengthens a strong organization - it doesn't threaten it. That's all for right now! Thank you for following along as we work nonstop to represent YOU in Congress. Alex, you deserve a representative who cares, and that's why I'm running - I care about creating a better future for you and your family.

Your campaign brief for June 27, 2020 View this email in your browser Hey Alex - Dan Crenshaw here. I hope you are well. This week, I announced that federal support for COVID-19 testing sites in Houston would be extended beyond the original June 30th deadline, and set the record straight about the strength of our testing capacity. I also called out Democrats for road blocking meaningful police reform and called on Americans to hold the line and cancel 'cancel culture.' Follow me on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for regular updates and news you can use. As always, thank you for your support. Now, here’s your brief: FEDERAL SUPPORT EXTENDED FOR COVID-19 TESTING SITES Federal support for COVID-19 testing sites in Houston has been extended amid a recent uptick in cases. Houstonians have been inundated over the last few days with headlines about how the federal government was abandoning Houston and that our testing capacity would be severely diminished. But that was all false. The June 30th deadline for transition to local control of testing in Houston was well known by state and local officials. Texas was well prepared for this, and your ability to go get a test was never threatened. I spoke with Admiral Giroir at the Department of Health and Human Services, who is responsible for leading our testing strategy, and he agreed to extend federal support for testing in Houston past the June 30th deadline. But we must not allow fear-mongering politicians to hold us hostage to fear. Governor Abbott is taking targeted steps to address a new uptick in cases, which I support. But universal lockdowns were never the right response, and we can never go back to them. I’ll continue to push for smart reopening strategies that balance our health care concerns with economic concerns. Houston is well-prepared to handle this uptick in cases, and we will get through this together. DEMOCRATS BLOCK POLICE REFORM The last couple days have been pretty shocking. Nancy Pelosi would rather call Republicans murderers than work with us to improve policing. Every attempt to work on common sense, bipartisan reforms was blocked. Why? Because it isn’t about police reform, it’s about November. Democrats blocked even having a debate on Senator Tim Scott’s commonsense proposal to improve policing, which I have cosponsored. In the House, Republicans weren’t allowed even a single amendment on the Democrat bill that would lead to less policing. All of us - especially cops - want to address this issue. But Democrats cannot afford to have Republicans offer serious solutions to improve policing. This is why Congress doesn’t work. HOLD THE LINE. CANCEL 'CANCEL CULTURE' George Washington. Abraham Lincoln. Ulysses S. Grant. Teddy Roosevelt. None of these beloved figures in America’s story are safe from the outrage mob that has swept across America in recent weeks. The mob has targeted an ever-growing list of statues, books, movies, television shows, and even food brands. It needs to stop. We must hold the line and cancel 'cancel culture.' The Fourth of July is right around the corner, and it’s time to remind ourselves that America is great. Our Founders signed their death warrant when they signed the Declaration of Independence, all so that we could live freer and more prosperous than any other group of people in human history. That’s worth celebrating, not canceling.

WOW! These past 8 months have been a blur. Running for Congress is a major endeavor, but also an amazingly rewarding experience. From meeting with Alex, WOW! These past 8 months have been a blur. Running for Congress is a major endeavor, but also an amazingly rewarding experience. From meeting with small businesses in Allamakee, Dubuque, or Winneshiek county, or spending time with Farm Bureau members throughout the district, to meeting new people and building new friendships, I am honored to take on this challenge to fight for the principles that we believe in. Less government, and more common sense solutions for Iowans. This campaign has never had more momentum than it does right now. From our grassroots infrastructure to our fundraising operation IN Iowa, we're firing on all cylinders, and it's a testament to you. When our fourth quarter finance numbers are published, it will send a message that together we are going to win this race and have the resources to get our message out. We will post our largest fundraising quarter by a clear margin thanks to your generous support. Our number of individual donors has also increased exponentially. I am humbled by your support and inspired by your belief in my ability to lead. It would be a tremendous honor to represent you in Washington, and I am so grateful for everything you have done to put our campaign in the position it is. Undoubtedly, we're going to ask you for more resources and more of your time. We're going to ask you to recruit your friends to support my campaign and join our cause. We need you. I need you. However, today, I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support and prayers for my family as the campaign intensifies in the coming months as I head back into legislative session here in Iowa. Happy New Year and may you and your family have a fantastic start to 2020. Ashley Hinson Paid for by Ashley Hinson for Congress This email was sent to [[EMAIL_REDACTED]]. Click here to unsubscribe.

With just two weeks left until the November 3rd election, Ashley has been busy traveling to every corner of Iowa’s First District. This year's election is critical, and Ashley Hinson is determined to unseat liberal Congresswoman Abby Finkenauer and bring some Iowa common sense back to Congress. We must defeat Congresswoman Finkenauer in this election to make sure she doesn’t take ownership of this seat. Ashley Hinson has repeatedly visited every county in Iowa’s First District, asking for support and answering questions from voters. In the midst of the pre-election hurry, Ashley recognizes the importance of family time. She and her husband Matt took their two sons to Bloomsbury Farm for a fall outing. The facility is still recovering from the devastating derecho, and recovery efforts are still underway. Aside from being a wife, mom, and state legislator, Ashley is also wearing the hat of a part time teacher for her two boys, Max and Jax, as they are now back in school. Ashley spent time with conservative patriots in Tama County to honor first responders in the district and meet supporters. This was an opportunity for citizens to meet representatives and honor the service of men and women that selflessly serve IA-01. Senator Chuck Grassely spent time in Waverly campaigning for Ashley and shared his thoughts on a relief bill that would help small business owners in Iowa after the pandemic’s effect on the economy. Senator Grassely believes that one relief package will not be successful in solving a multitude of different issues brought on by the pandemic, and that individual actions will need to be taken instead. If you would like to support Ashley Hinson in this election as she fights to be IA-01’s conservative voice in Congress, please donate here. Any amount you can give has a tremendous impact on the outcome of this race and gets Ashley one step closer to giving Washington a big dose of Iowa common sense.

Abby Finkenauer has called Medicare for All the only thing that makes sense right now and that's UNACCEPTABLE here in Iowa. We need leaders who are going to lead by example and stand up for this community rather than sow divisiveness when our community is rebuilding itself. Alex, I am running to defeat Congresswoman Finkenauer to bring real leadership and common sense back to Congress. I want to help rebuild and improve our infrastructure, make healthcare affordable, and invest in our Iowan children’s education. Government should NOT stand in the way of Americans living their lives and chasing their dreams.

Alex, Today is the moment we’ve been waiting for since I launched my campaign for Congress in May of 2019. It’s time to send Congresswoman Finkenauer and her party’s liberal agenda packing by getting to the polls. I’m running for two very important reasons, and their names are Max and Jax, and they are our boys. As a mom, my mission is to leave them a stronger community and a better country. I’m truly worried about the direction the country is headed under a Speaker Pelosi led House with Congresswoman Finkenauer by her side. Congresswoman Finkenauer wants to increase taxes at a time when we need economic growth now more than ever. I’d work to make the tax cuts passed by Republicans permanent. She believes government is the solution to every problem, I believe in smaller government and more transparency. It’s time for new leaders who will put people before politics. I’m ready to tackle the issues that really matter to Iowa families -- reforming our broken healthcare system, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, securing our border and putting money back in the pockets of hard working Iowans. I’d also work to ban former members of Congress from becoming lobbyists. Simply put, I’ll work to clean up Finkenauer and Pelosi’s Washington. Today, we have the chance to fix that and send some Iowa common sense to Washington. It’s time for new leaders who will put people first, not politics and special interests.

For Immediate Release June 2, 2020 Email: [[URL REDACTED]] Phone: 319-343-6556 Ashley Hinson: Honored to be the Republican Nominee in Iowa First’s Congressional District Marion, IA – Ashley Hinson, Republican candidate for Congress in Iowa’s 1st district, won the Republican Primary today. The campaign goes into the general election with nearly $1.1 Million Dollars Cash on Hand and the campaign infrastructure needed to win this race. Here is a video statement from Ashley Hinson. “I’m honored to be the Republican Nominee for Congress in Iowa’s First Congressional District,” said Hinson. “The election in November will be a clear choice. Do we want to get the government out of the way and give our workers the tools they need to get our economy roaring again, or do we want to pursue a liberal agenda of higher taxes and more regulations?” Hinson continued, “I’m ready to tackle the issues that really matter to Iowa families -- reforming our broken healthcare system, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, securing our border and putting money back in the pockets of hard working Iowans. Republicans, Democrats, and Independents are all invited to join my team. Together, we can send Iowa common sense to Washington.” Since launching her campaign, Ashley has established herself as one of the strongest House candidates in the country. Ashley was recently elevated to the highest tier of the ‘Young Gun Program’ by the National Republican Congressional Committee after establishing her clear path to victory. National political forecasters believe the 1st Congressional District will be one of the most competitive races in 2020. The Cook Political Report has rated IA-01 as “Toss Up”. Ashley has a record of winning tough elections. She won in 2016 in a swing district to help hold the Iowa House majority and outperformed the Republican ticket by 5-8 points across House District 67, the heart of IA-01. She won 9 of 13 precincts in House District 67 in spite of Democratic outside groups outspending Republican outside groups. An Iowa native, Ashley is the first woman to represent Iowa’s 67th House District, which covers Hiawatha, Robins, Cedar Rapids and Marion. Prior to serving in the Iowa House, Ashley was an award-winning reporter and anchor for KCRG-TV9 in Cedar Rapids. Ashley currently lives in Marion with her husband Matt and their two sons.

We are in the era of Trump, after all — a time when decency and honor are no longer applicable to their conduct or policies. But when Senator Lindsey Graham reminisced yesterday about the “good ole days” of segregation, in his official capacity as chairman of one of the most powerful committees in the United States Senate, it made my stomach turn. Referencing such a dark chapter in American history with fondness is shameful in any context, as was the excuse he gave afterward. You were joking? I’m sorry, Senator Graham, but NO ONE is laughing.

Jaime Harrison is exactly that, and the good news is that he can win. In fact, a poll released today has him up by a point — 47 to 46!

Alex — Common sense would suggest that Donald Trump shouldn't be checking out of Walter Reed today. He's likely still shedding the virus, making him a risk to everyone around him. But Donald Trump has never had much of a relationship with common sense. Let's assume for a second that Trump — whose age and weight put him in a high-risk group — is in fact healthy enough to be discharged. In that case, look no further than the world-class health care he’s had access to since his diagnosis. Alex — If quality health care access is good for Donald Trump, then why isn’t it good for ordinary Americans? Donald Trump has said he would preserve protections for those with pre-existing conditions, even as his administration is in court asking a judge to dismantle those very protections. This is exactly what Democrats are fighting for in this election. Health care access is a matter of life and death, and we can’t afford to let Republicans dismantle basic protections during a public health crisis.

When Democrats Turn Out Alex, In a dangerous polling shift, Democratic Representative Xochitl Torres Small \-- one of our endorsed candidates \-- has just had her race in New Mexico’s 2nd congressional district moved from “tilt Democrat” to “toss-up,” according to Inside Elections. In 2016, Representative Torres Small flipped the historically red district by fewer than 4,000 votes \-- making history while helping Democrats take back the House. Since then, she has led with the mantra that “common sense solutions don’t come with a party label” \-- and she’s now working to protect her seat and block the GOP’s full-fledged efforts to flip New Mexico red. But AP News has reported that Rep. Torres Small’s Trump-endorsed opponent, Yvette Herrell, had “one of the biggest fundraising quarters for a Republican congressional candidate in state history” after calling on Donald Trump and his Republican loyalists to campaign for her \-- and state numbers show that Republican voter registration is outpacing Democrats in the district by more than twice the margin of victory in 2018. Democrats have warned us that this presidential election could be decided in the House if Donald Trump decides to contest election results and if voter turnout is low. Despite our Democratic House majority, Republicans hold a majority of state delegations in the House. We cannot afford to lose any Democratic seats \-- that’s why we’re mobilizing to provide crucial support to Rep. Xochitl Torres Small’s campaign in the last stretch of the election. We’re aiming to raise $5,000 by TONIGHT to help Rep. Xochitl Torres Small overcome the GOP’s targeted smear ads against her, reach the voters she needs to win, and protect the Democratic House majority. You more than anyone know that the fight against Republican tyranny must be a collective effort. Small-dollar donations are known to be the driving force in tight race victories; will you pitch in $10, $25, $50, or anything you can today to help us reach our goal and protect Rep. Torres Small’s crucial Democratic seat? With your help, we’ll protect and expand our House majority and exile Trump’s far-right agenda from power. We can’t thank you enough for all you’re doing to move our country forward. When Democrats Turn Out DONATE Paid for by When Democrats Turn Out PAC PO Box 15320 Washington, DC 20003 Unsubscribe

Team Wittman -- Can you believe we have less than 50 days until Election Day? Now is the time where we need to step up and give our all to the cause. When you wake up on November 4th, who do you want to be representing you in Congress? Is it a man who has openly supported Socialist policies like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All? I have lived in the district for over 30 years and understand the family and economic values we hold dear in our communities, like affordable healthcare, a strong national defense, and common sense solutions to our nation's problems. We cannot let our opponent outwork us — I need your help. That's why I am inviting you to join me this Saturday, September 19, for lawn sign distribution parties throughout the district! It will be a fun-filled event with food, music and camaraderie with our volunteers, the campaign team and me. What takes place at a sign distribution party? You may: * Pick up your own signs for your home or properties to display * Pick up signs to distribute to your supportive neighbors * Pick up signs and a list of addresses that have requested a sign and help deliver on Saturday (contactless delivery; just leave at the front porch) Join us at any of the following locations on Saturday, September 19: * 4:30-5:30PM — King George/Caroline at 15496 Paige Road, Woodford, VA 22580 * 6:30-7:30PM — Hanover/New Kent at 6039 Mechanicsville Turnpike, Mechanicsville, VA 23111 Food for volunteers will be provided at the event. Please RSVP to [[URL REDACTED]] and include how you are willing to help. Thank you so much for the continued support you have shown me during my tenure in Congress, and I look forward to serving you and the First District for another 2 years.

Our planet is sending us a message. One we cannot afford to ignore. # Mark Kelly for Senate Friends - Since September, 15.6 million acres of Australia have burned in one of the country’s worst fire seasons. The fires have now killed at least 25 people, destroyed almost 2,000 homes, and an estimated 1 billion animals have been lost. This is a global emergency we cannot ignore. Australia’s fires are spreading more quickly because of drought and record high temperatures. Both of which are made worse by climate change. While this may be happening thousands of miles away in Australia, right here in the United States we have a Congress that is letting us down. Their failure to act is a price we will all have to pay in the years and generations ahead. That’s why we need to elect people like Mark who have a special perspective on our planet and are serious about addressing climate change. So if you’re ready to join us in this fight, sign on today and make your voice heard: If you’re ready to get serious about climate change, sign our petition and join Mark. This is an issue that deserves our full attention, future generations are counting on us to act. Join Mark -- demand action on climate change Make no mistake, our planet is sending us a message. We cannot afford to ignore it. And we can guarantee that it isn’t going to fix itself. That’s why we need your support on this mission so we can restore common sense and a trust in science and facts back to Congress. Thank you for taking this issue seriously, Team Kelly Climate Change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. If you agree that it’s time to send leaders to Congress who are serious about tackling this issue, sign our petition today. ADD YOUR NAME * * * This email was sent to [[EMAIL_REDACTED]].

On Friday, my team sent an email about Pete Sessions’ repeated attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and strip health care coverage from hundreds of thousands of Texans. I want to reassure y’all: as your next representative I will NEVER allow that to happen on my watch. Health care is too important for our community, especially during a global pandemic. Yet, when Republicans gain power, their first thought is to their own reelection chances, then to their corporate backers, and lastly to their own party. It’s never about their constituents and it’s never about the good of the country. I’m running to change that — to bring back common sense to our Congress and a prosperous future to our community. But before I can get to work for Central Texas, I need your help to win on November 3. Can you chip in to my campaign today.

Rick Kennedy (D-Central Texas) is running for the open seat in the 17th District. Chip in to his campaign here >> * * * Dear Brown, Trump and his enablers are trying very hard to get Americans to ignore the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. But in a cynical acknowledgement of reality, they are now requiring attendees at Trump's Tulsa rally to release the campaign of liability should they contract the disease at the event. You can't gaslight a virus. Apparently Trump's lawyers realize that. On a positive note, we've got momentum to restore common sense and competency to Washington. As of yesterday morning, only eleven days into the month, we surpassed our previous record and are having our best fundraising month ever. Having the resources to get our message out is critical - so we can't rest on that accomplishment. This is only at the beginning. We need to build on the momentum. My remaining Republican opponents are "more of the same" candidates. You deserve much better. Demand Better by pitching in now.

Dear Brown, Please find below our press release from yesterday. To protect the health and safety of our team and the general public, we'll be running an entirely virtual campaign until further notice. * * * AUSTIN, TX, March 12, 2020 - Rick Kennedy's statement on campaigning during a pandemic: We are in unprecedented times with events often moving faster than we can absorb. But certain truths still hold--we must not panic, we must take all common sense precautions, we must listen to the facts, however scary, from our health care professionals, and we must look after each other. With these precepts in mind, we intend to campaign for the runoff election. Now, more than ever, we need experienced, calm & intelligent leadership in Congress. We are considering many options on how best to campaign. They include: * Holding remote town halls * Offering one-on-one FaceTime calls with Rick during selected times * Online forums with county party members * Ramping up phone banking * Current event messaging for our texting teams * Pausing all blockwalking activities until the situation improves and best practices can be implemented In closing, we don't know how long these times will last, so let's be kind to one another. * * * I speak often about how most policy decisions seem to be aimed at winning the next election rather than making sure we are as strong and prosperous in 50 years as we are now. And about how recent policy decisions have left us less prepared to confront a crisis as such as the one we now face. I only wish we been handed a less stark scenario to demonstrate the need for calm, logical, fact-based and forward-looking leadership in Washington. Please help us get there. $10 $25 $50 $100 $250 Other Thank you, Rick Paid for by Rick Kennedy for Congress Rick Kennedy for Congress 2203 Emmett Pkwy Austin, TX 78726 [[URL REDACTED]] To unsubscribe, please click here.

Dear Brown, With over 80,000 Americans dead, and more than 30 million out of work, the impact of COVID-19 have been devastating. The lack of preparedness and divisiveness in our response - a stunning failure of the most basic responsibility of government. Despite the administration's hollow declarations of victory and calls to get back to normal, the virus is still with us, and our capacity to manage it has grown only minimally. There is no back to normal, only forward to a new normal. Let's shape our new normal together. A new normal in which we don't offer up our senior citizens as human sacrifices to revive the economy. A new normal in which everyone has access to health care regardless of employment status. A new normal in which we invest in education, infrastructure, and preparedness so that we're ready for every challenge thrown at us. It's time for Central Texans and all Americans to shock the political class, to overcome the gerrymandering and the dark money, to stand up and scream that we're done with the status quo. Let's get back to common sense, for the common good. Please pitch in if you can. We can do this - together.

Image Alex, Hard work and a commitment to helping others has been the driving force for Governor Parson. So when the COVID-19 pandemic came to Missouri, he made it his mission to protect the health and well-being of all Missourians. During this crisis, Governor Parson mobilized medical professionals, organized task forces, and signed the largest recovery budget in Missouri history to keep our state safe. Our hospitals are NOT overwhelmed, and things are improving, which is why the governor made the decision to move forward and begin reopening Missouri's economy, today. He is still focused on keeping Missourians healthy, but he also knows that it's time to get everyone back to work so that they can continue pursuing the American Dream. Governor Parson’s plan is deliberate and data-driven. He knows that it’s up to each one of us to do the right thing so that we can move our state forward. Missourians have each other’s backs and will continue to put others first. While Missouri reopens and Missourians get back to work, Governor Parson’s campaign will resume as many normal operations as possible. This includes fundraising. To help us catch up we are launching a 72-Hour Campaign Kickstart Fund. Governor Parson is more dedicated than ever to continue working hard for the people of Missouri with common sense, trust, honor and integrity. He can't do it without your help, Alex. Missourians can accomplish anything. Governor Parson knows this and is ready to start rebuilding Missouri, together.

Image Alex, Governor Parson addressed Missourians tonight after a big win for Team Parson. Watch it here >>> The Governor wanted to thank you for all your hard work, Alex. But the hard work doesn’t stop now. Mike will take on our liberal opponent in just a few months, and we need all hands on deck to win in November! As the Governor said tonight, there is no shortage of radical left politicians who want to promote extreme policies in Missouri that would halt the progress we have made for job creation and our economy. That's why the Governor's opponent has been endorsed by leading liberals in the country like Elizabeth Warren, who supports massive new government programs and tax increases for working Missouri families. Governor Parson served 6 years in the United States Army, and spent 22 years in law enforcement – these experiences taught him the importance of public service and helping people in their most difficult times. The Governor is leading our state by putting the people of Missouri over politics. In 90 days, Missourians will again vote and decide which vision to support for the next 4 years. Elections matter, and we have a clear choice this November. I choose to support our strong, conservative leader, Governor Mike Parson. Our Governor continues to do the hard work to move Missouri forward with common sense, faith, honor, and integrity. Join us in fighting for our state's future, any amount helps.

Image DAILY UPDATE: Missouri Department of Transportation Takes Steps to Assist with COVID-19 Response Image March 26, 2020 Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) Director Patrick McKenna and Missouri Department of Mental Health Director Mark Stringer provided updates at today’s press briefing If you have questions about what precautions you should take, please visit [[URL REDACTED]], or call our 24/7 hotline at 877-435-8411. To watch the Governor’s press conference, please click here. Governor Parson Reminds Missourians to Take Care of Their Mental Health “We realize this is a challenging, uncertain time for Missouri and the nation,” Governor Parson said. “Mental health is something everyone should focus on not just right now, but going forward as Missourians continue to cope with the after-effects of COVID-19. We’re going to get through this together, but we have to take care of ourselves mentally and physically.” The Department of Mental Health (DMH) serves people of all ages with mental illness, substance use disorders, and intellectual and developmental disabilities. The Department serves approximately 170,000 people a year through both institutions and community programs. In response to COVID-19, DMH has taken a number of steps to ensure its services continue with as little disruption as possible. The Department has worked with partners across state government to make it possible for community providers to do much of their work by telephone, rather than the traditional face-to-face requirement. Service providers have also dramatically increased their use of telehealth, and DMH is exploring ways to stay in touch with people who cannot afford cell phones or extra minutes. For psychiatric hospitals and rehabilitation centers, DMH has worked with other state departments to share best practices, policies, and procedures during times of crisis. Public visitation is temporarily suspended at all DMH facilities and offices statewide. For Missourians struggling to cope with this pandemic, the federal Disaster Distress Helpline (800-985-5990) is an important resource. It is staffed with mental health professionals who can talk with you and, if you need more help than they can provide, connect you with services here in Missouri. Specifically, they can connect you with the Access Crisis Intervention (ACI) system. This system is staffed with professionals linked to state certified mental health and substance use disorder services. The ACI system is free and completely confidential. Missouri Department of Transportation Takes Steps to Assist with COVID-19 Response Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) Director Patrick McKenna also provided an update at today’s briefing. MODOT has announced a free, temporary overweight permit that allows haulers to transport up to 100,000 pounds on any Missouri highway, including interstates, through April 30, 2020, as long as the following criteria are met: * A copy of the special permit and a bill of lading must be in the possession of the operator of the overweight vehicle during its operation and shall be produced for inspection upon request to any Missouri law enforcement official and/or any MoDOT employee. Motor carriers can find this document at [[URL REDACTED]] * The load must carry supplies and/or equipment in the direct effort to prevent, contain, mitigate, and treat the effects of the COVID-19 virus. This includes shipments of livestock, poultry, feed, and fuels. Any fuels being transported can be hauled at 100,000 pounds or up to the manufacturer’s specifications of the tank type being operated – whichever results in the lower weight. To ensure the continued transportation of essential supplies, equipment, and individuals, the Missouri Department of Revenue has also issued the following extensions in coordination with MoDOT: * Sixty-day extension of driving privileges: This extension applies to individuals with CDL or non-CDL license expiration dates of March 1, 2020, through April 30, 2020. For example, an individual with a CDL expiring March 1, 2020, will have until May 1, 2020, to complete the required license renewal in their local license office. * Extension of CDL medical certificates: This extension applies to individuals holding a CDL or CLP with a current medical certificate that has been issued for a period of 90 days or more and has an expiration date of March 1, 2020, through April 30, 2020. These individuals have been granted an extension of their medical certification until June 30, 2020. This relief will give Missouri’s commercial drivers additional time to complete the required medical exam and to submit an updated medical certificate to their local license office so their Missouri driver record can be updated. * Both of these extensions have been applied automatically, so no additional action is required by eligible drivers to qualify. In addition, MoDOT is making an effort to keep interstate highway rest areas open to the traveling public and commercial motor carriers. The rest areas are being cleaned and disinfected on a more frequent basis. Call to Action: What Missourians Can do to Combat COVID-19 Social distancing is one of the most important steps Missourians can take to combat the spread of COVID-19. * Follow the statewide social distancing order: Avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people. Avoid eating and drinking at restaurants, bars, or food courts – use drive-thru, delivery, or pick-up instead. Do not visit nursing homes, long-term care facilities, retirement homes, or assisted living homes unless to provide critical assistance. * People may still visit a variety of places, including grocery stores, gas stations, parks, and banks, so long as necessary precautions are taken and maintained to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, including maintaining at least six feet of distance between all individuals that are not family members. * Exercise common sense: If you feel sick, stay home. Do not go to work. If someone in your household has tested positive for COVID-19, keep the entire household at home. Do not go to work. * Take extra precautions: If you are an older person, stay home and away from other people. If you are a person with a serious underlying health condition that can put you at increased risk (for example, a condition that impairs your lung or heart function or weakens your immune system), stay home and away from other people. * Protect yourself and others: Avoid discretionary travel, shopping trips, and social visits. Practice good hygiene and stay home as much as possible. Image Share Governor Parson is working each day to respond to COVID-19 and protect the health and well-being of Missourans.

Meuser for Congress Alex -- Good afternoon and welcome to our Week-End Update. I want to begin by thanking all of our campaign volunteers, supporters and committed Republican voters in the 9th District for signing my petitions. Today, we made our initial filing to qualify for the ballot. Our campaign asks that you continue to circulate and sign petitions. On Tuesday, we will be filing our final supplemental petition signatures. If you have additional petitions and need to arrange a pick-up, please contact our Field Campaign Manager Rob Bresnahan at [[URL REDACTED]] As part of my commitment to applying business practices to government, I am determined to only spend tax dollars in a manner that benefits our District. As a Congressman, it is not sufficient to simply talk about spending tax dollars more responsibly. We have to walk the walk. For 2019, our office returned $159,962 or 11.8% of our annual office budget, to the U.S. Treasury. WFMZ covered the story. This week, our nation's economy continues to show strength. January's job’s report came in strong and serves as another reliable indicator of our economy’s strength. Unemployment is low and more jobs are coming. In fact, we have over 1 million open jobs across the nation. Closing the skills gap by increasing job training programs and apprenticeships is essential to developing a 21st Century Workforce. A recent Press-Enterprise editorial highlighted that Vo-Tech seniors are earning $18 an hour to start. The Pledge to America’s Workers is driving skills training and placing more workers in well-paying jobs nationwide. President Trump has proposed a significant funding increase for career education. CTE schools play an essential role in our District and nationwide in developing a 21st Century workforce. President Trump is putting workers first and putting America first. On Wednesday, I attended an event with the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) where they awarded White House advisor Ivanka Trump an award for her support of manufacturing. She was the inaugural recipient of the association's Alexander Hamilton Award. Ivanka Trump understands the issue of ensuring that Americans are equipped with the skills necessary for the jobs of today and tomorrow. The President’s Budget for America’s Future doesn’t saddle future generations with debt. To ensure that we always maintain fiscal restraint, I introduced the BASIC Act to provide a full outlook on how new federal spending impacts national debt. This is common sense. In that same vein, I recently spoke at a recent hearing with Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought about the budget about the issue of a runaway national debt. Thankfully, the President’s budget proposal exercises fiscal restraint, roots out waste, fraud, and abuse, and focuses funding in critical areas like national defense, skills training, and veterans. President Donald J. Trump leads from the front, proving the government can do more with less. I applaud Acting Secretary Russell Vought on working to reform government, not reduce available programs. This week, I attended a meeting alongside the Republican members of the House Budget Committee with the Office of Management and Budget Director and Staff to discuss the President’s budget in detail. In News You Won’t Read In The Mainstream Media: President Trump and Congressional Republicans are investing in forgotten communities. These policies are spurring investment to revitalize hurting communities and unleash their economic potential. * President Trump’s historic tax cuts established Opportunity Zones to incentivize long-term investments in low-income communities nationwide. * There are 8,760 designated Opportunity Zones, home to nearly 35 million Americans in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and 5 Territories. Our District contains 10 Opportunity Zones. * Opportunity Zones are projected to spur $100 billion in private investment in these communities. * Opportunity Zones are a powerful vehicle for bringing economic growth and job creation to the American communities that need them the most. * The median family income in these communities is 37 percent below the State median. * The average poverty rate in an Opportunity Zone is more than 32 percent. * President Trump launched the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council – which has already identified more than 180 regulatory reforms to encourage investment. One of my top priorities is to foster economic revitalization in our District. We have 10 Opportunity Zones tracts in our District. This program will help to create an opportunity for all by spurring new jobs, promoting long-term investment, and building greater prosperity for generations to come. The Opportunity Zone incentive offers capital gains tax relief to investors for new investment in designated areas. Investment benefits include deferral of tax on prior gains as late as 2026 if the amount of the gain is invested in a Qualified Opportunity Fund. The benefits also include tax forgiveness on gains on that investment if the investor holds the investment for at least ten years. (Pictured below at a meeting last year with White House officials in Tamaqua discussing federal Opportunity Zones) This week, I penned an editorial that ran in the Wilkes Barre Times-Leader regarding the House Democrat’s failed impeachment effort. The editorial was entitled, “Let’s bridge troubled waters,” and can be read by clicking here. I have spoken at great lengths about the impeachment efforts and how they were a completely partisan witch-hunt against our President. My hope is that with this sad chapter in American history in our rearview mirror, Democrat leadership in the House will be willing to work with Republicans to start working on the priorities that are truly important to Americans. The New Hampshire Presidential Primary took place on Tuesday and it was certainly a tale of two different elections. First, President Trump was victorious, which is not really news as he ran without serious opposition. But what is news is the amazing number of votes he received. (See chart below). President Trump received over double the number of votes President Barack Obama received in 2012, President George W. Bush received in 2004, President Bill Clinton received in 1996 and President Ronald Reagan in 1984. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party's presidential contest continues to be an unmitigated disaster. Each candidate continues to promote agendas that are far-left and it does not appear they are any closer to having a nominee. Every Primary Election has proven one thing... President Trump is in a solid position and I believe the below political cartoon encapsulates the current state of the race. On the Campaign Trail: Our team continued to travel around the District attending events and collecting petition signatures. We attended a Young Republican petition signing party last weekend with an impressive group of young patriots. We had a great conversation about current affairs. We attended the Carbon County GOP Dinner on Wednesday. (Field Campaign Manager Rob Bresnahan, Beaver Meadow councilman Jim Leonard and Tom Gerhard pictured below) Today, President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will take a lap in The Beast prior to the start of the Daytona 500. Keeping America Great. Start Your Engines. On a final note, I enjoyed a very proud moment as a father as I was afforded the opportunity to congratulate the Dallas High School Mountaineers football team, the team my son competed on, for their great season last year. Dallas High School finished as the runner-up for the Pennsylvania State AAAA Championship.

It was an exciting few days after Monday’s news that Donald Trump, Jr., had endorsed Corky and selected him “Make America Great Again” Candidate of the Week. Alternate text The endorsement came a little more than two weeks after President Donald Trump announced his support of Corky, with Trump, Jr. tweeting to his more than 5 million followers: “Proud to name @CorkyForSenate this week's #MAGA candidate of the week! Corky is a West Point Grad & Army vet who will fight to put America first & defend our God-given rights. We need to flip this seat to protect our Senate majority!” The younger Trump’s endorsement included a link to WinRed, a fundraising platform endorsed by the Republican National Committee and President Donald Trump, and this video, in which he urges Republicans in New Hampshire to support Corky’s efforts to unseat Jeanne Shaheen. Alternate text In related news, Corky was a featured speaker at the June 27 opening of the Trump Victory office in Bedford. Joining him as speaker were Matt Mowers, GOP First Congressional District candidate, and Corey Lewandowski, President Trump’s 2016 campaign manager, shown here speaking to the gathering. The enthusiastic crowd of supporters was thrilled to launch the President’s re-election effort in New Hampshire and to hear from Corky and Matt, both of whom have earned the President’s endorsement and who will help turn New Hampshire Red again! PS – And closing out this week, Corky learned Students for Trump is also endorsing his run for U.S. Senate! Alternate text State Senator Birdsell and Other N.H. Legislators/GOP Activists Endorse Messner for U.S. Senate State Senator Regina Birdsell, representing the critical Republican strongholds of Derry, Windham, and Hampstead, has announced her support of U.S. Senate candidate Corky Messner. A key player in the effort to ensure election integrity, Birdsell is a veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard and has represented the 19th District since 2014. She previously was a N.H. House member from 2010 to 2014, chairs the Rockingham Republican Committee, is former co-chair of Florida Senator Marco Rubio’s New Hampshire primary campaign, and was a member of the board of Seacoast Republican Women. Alternate text "I recognize the true conservative in this race is Corky Messner. Corky will work with the N.H. Legislature and not against it. Corky has the common sense and the independent spirit we need in the United States Senate," says Birdsell. "I am honored to be part of Corky's winning team!” “Regina believes as I do that individual liberty and economic freedom have made this country great,” says Corky. “She is a true champion of the Granite State and its residents, and I welcome her support as we work to defeat career politician Jeanne Shaheen.” In addition to Birdsell, the Messner campaign has announced endorsements from State Representatives Norm Major, Dennis Acton, Michael Yakubovich, Alan Bershtein, and Aboul Khan, and GOP activists Nick Gray, Danielle Rieger, and Gary and Lucy Brockney. Greeting Our Legislators Image Corky stopped by the Whittemore Center at UNH this past week to greet New Hampshire legislators. Our State Representatives were attending their last session in Durham, and he took time out to chat with Corky before heading to work. Many thanks, as always, to New Hampshire’s great citizen legislators and for the GOP leadership of Rep. Dick Hinch! Things are Looking Up: Great Job News Points to Economic Comeback Good news as we close out the week -- 4.8 MILLION jobs were created in June, despite predictions that number would be around 2.9 million.

Read story here. “I thank the Association and its members for this endorsement,” says Corky. “I have always believed in the right to bear arms, envisioned by our Founders and protected by our Constitution, and the National Association for Gun Rights has been a steadfast ally in the fight against relentless attacks on our Second Amendment freedoms." "At a time when the Second Amendment is under assault by anti-gun politicians in both parties, it's encouraging to see a candidate make protecting the right to bear arms a centerpiece of his campaign." says NAGR PAC Director Dudley Brown. Lakes Region State Senator French and Others Join Rapidly Growing List of Messner Endorsers Image State Senator Harold French, who represents Laconia and the surrounding Lakes Region towns, has endorsed Corky Messner. Also endorsing Corky in his bid to unseat incumbent Democrat Jeanne Shaheen are State Representatives Chris True and David Love, and prominent Republicans Cody Belanger, Tina Harley, Nicole Martin, David Scott, Alex Talcott, Ray Tweedie, and Dan Wheeler. “I am humbled by the support of Senator French and the many others who have recognized that we represent the best chance of defeating Senator Shaheen in November. Their endorsements will help us continue the fight to restore New Hampshire’s conservative values and common sense to the U.S. Senate," says Corky. Sen. French, a Franklin resident, has represented District 7 since 2016. The well-known auctioneer and real estate broker previously served in the House. Also supporting the Messner campaign are Rep. Chris True of Sandown, who represents Rockingham-District 4, who like Messner is an Army veteran and is serving his third term, and Rep. David Love of Derry (Rockingham-District 6), who was elected in 2018 and believes in smaller government and lower taxes. Rounding out the latest list of endorsements are: * Cody Belanger of Epping, Selectman, former Area Vice Chair of the New Hampshire Republican State Committee and central Rockingham County GOP activist; * Tina Harley of Seabrook, a member of the New Hampshire Federation of Republican Women and Team Trump supporter; * Nicole Martin, a Bedford area activist and a New Hampshire Trump delegate; * David Scott, Strafford County GOP activist; * Alex Talcott of Durham, financial planning specialist and adjunct instructor in accounting/finance and management at the University of New Hampshire; * Ray Tweedie of Rye, Rockingham County Register of Probate, former State Senate candidate and Seacoast community activist; and * Dan Wheeler of Merrimack, a Marine Corps veteran and retired Sergeant with N.H.

Tap or click to read more >> Veteran. Businessman. Conservative. Image Contact Us Volunteer Thank You, New Hampshire! We Did It!! Corky is now the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate, thanks to the support of Granite Staters who want change in Washington, and a return of conservative values and common sense. Alternate text "I humbly thank the voters of New Hampshire for their support. Granite Staters are tired of career politicians and Washington bureaucrats,” said Corky on the win. “They deserve a U.S. Senator committed to individual liberty and economic freedom, a political outsider who understands how to revitalize our economy and bring common sense and New Hampshire values to the issues we face. This November's election is critical to this state and this nation, and I look forward to working with President Trump to keep America great." And while he’s pleased with the win, he noted on Primary Night, “We are not celebrating -- we’re unifying.” Alternate text Alternate text The day after the primary win, Corky joined GOP candidates at a unity breakfast, to present a united front with the November 3rd general election looming. Gov. Chris Sununu was on hand, as were other Republican primary winners, such as First District Congressional candidate Matt Mowers and Second District Congressional candidate Steve Negron. Also attending was Don Bolduc, who vied for the GOP nomination. He and Corky shook hands and agreed that a united front is critical if Republicans want to be successful in November. In The News Corky made the radio talk show rounds following his primary victory, speaking Wednesday with NH Today host Jack Heath, and Chris Ryan of NH Now. As he thanked the voters of New Hampshire, he urged GOP unity and reminded listeners he will beat incumbent Jeanne Shaheen in November. Go, Corky! (Click here to listen to the Heath interview and here for the Ryan chat.) Alternate text New Hampshire Loses a True Public Servant Alternate text Corky attended the public memorial service Friday, Sept. 11, for former Governor Stephen Merrill, who passed away Sept. 5. In a statement, Corky noted that Merrill “was a true public servant and his passing is a profound loss for those who knew him personally, professionally and politically. He was a man of integrity, a true conservative who never wavered in his beliefs. He is credited with creating the phrase ‘the New Hampshire Advantage’ -- a reference to our lack of sales and income taxes -- and believed, as I do, in less government, individual liberty and economic freedom. My prayers are with his family and friends at this difficult time.” Remembering the Day That Changed America Corky shared his thoughts on the anniversary of 9/11: "Today is a somber day, one that commemorates a horrific event in our nation’s history. As we pause to reflect on the loss of life, grieve with the families who mourn their loved ones, and honor the selfless first responders who gave their lives saving others, we stand strong and united as Americans. The senseless acts of terrorism that occurred Sept. 11, 2001, changed our lives forever, but we will continue to move forward and celebrate this nation’s values of liberty and freedom."

Will you chip in $10 for my friend Tom? A couple of years ago, I too was in my first election for Congress, and it was an honor to be afforded the opportunity to represent Wisconsin in Washington. But let me tell you something, Friend. I was prepared to enter a city with left wing politicians and partisan dysfunction, but I wasn’t expecting quite the mess that I’ve experienced in my last two years. I need principled Conservatives like Tom to fight with me in Washington. Will you join me in helping him? I don’t think we can disagree about this: we have some big issues facing our country. We need common sense solutions and main street values to help solve them. Unfortunately, in Washington, we’re getting a lot of big government -- even socialist -- ideas to try to solve them. You and I both know, we don’t need that. We need someone like Tom. A proven Conservative and former small business owner who has the exact type of Wisconsin values that Washington could use another dose of. Now -- I need you to help Tom in order to send me another ally in Washington. Chip in $10 for Tom right here. Thank you, Bryan Steil CHIP IN $10 FOR TOM FacebookTwitter Preferences | Unsubscribe

Priorities, principles and protecting Wisconsin No images? Click here Dear Friend, This has been an unprecedented few weeks that has been filled with high stress, uncertainty and the unknown of what is to come. More than ever, we need strong leadership for Northern and Western Wisconsin to stand up for common sense in Washington. Just like you, our campaign has to adapt. In the primary, and in every campaign I've run, we've relied heavily on the best way of getting a message out: face-to-face contact and grassroots support. That's going to have to change for this special election. I’m asking you to help support us financially as we re-tool and re-organize to win – only with a slightly different campaign than we had planned. We can't go door-to-door to meet with voters and spread our positive message. So, we will have to rely more heavily on media like TV, radio, and digital. Chip in $5 Chip in $10 Chip in $50 Finally, I want to remind you that you have the option to request an absentee ballot, if you'd prefer to do your civic duty without worrying about standing in line on Election Day. You can do that by going to [[URL REDACTED]] and filling out a simple form there. You'll ensure your vote counts, and you won't have to worry about heading to your polling location on Election Day.

It’s why I’m running for Congress and asking for your support to get there. Here’s the deal: we’re only a few days away from our most critical fundraising deadline before Election Day. There’s a lot on the line and on the ballot this year, and that’s why we must hit our End-of-Quarter goal. Will you chip in to get us closer to reaching our goal and flipping MI-03?

But, we’re only a few days away from a fundraising deadline that could make or break the results of this race.

Alex, We're so glad to have you on our team. Every day, it feels like the news is full of some new assault on environmental protection, racial justice, women’s and LGBTQ rights, and sheer common sense. I know that America is a place where courage and conviction can make a difference. I’ve walked the halls of Congress to successfully advocate for bills that protect Americans and the environment. I’ve marched with Marines to protect our country with blistered feet for miles over rough terrain, only to dig deep and keep marching. When the going gets tough, the tough get going. Will you consider becoming a founding member of our campaign by pitching in $5 or more? My values are why I decided to return to San Diego to take care of my mom, a retired public school teacher who is living with Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer’s Disease. Together, we have navigated complex health care systems and made tough choices about her long-term care. My mom’s sense of humor and positive attitude in the face of her health care challenges remind me that even in the darkest of days, hope is possible. In San Diego, we are blessed with beautiful weather and a diversity of cultures, languages, and ideas. But too many San Diegans are struggling to keep up with the rising costs of housing, to access affordable health care, and to pay for prescription drugs. We are concerned about the safety of our neighborhoods and schools. And we are outraged at the way human beings are being treated at our borders. It’s time for us to set the bar higher for what we can achieve. To take climate change seriously, to stand up to the corruption in Washington, and to start treating our military families and veterans with respect -- by bringing our troops home from endless wars and making sure that when they get back, they have a place to live, food to eat, and the services they need to thrive. I’m running for Congress because I believe that we can do better -- and that I have the determination, creativity, and experience to make a difference in Washington. My pride in my country is rooted in the values that America stands for. It’s time we restored those values to Washington.

Michiganders can disagree and still have respect for one another. However you feel about the current stay-at-home orders, we all can agree that people should never threaten violence to intimidate or make their point. While lawmakers should be focused on responding to this pandemic, the Michigan State Legislature instead had to cancel its legislative session to avoid the threat of armed protesters. As we continue to deal with COVID-19, I get that Michiganders are frustrated. I, too, am frustrated by this global pandemic. Like you, I want everything to return to normal – and for people to return to work – as soon as it’s safe to do so. But threatening the safety of others, to prevent them from doing their work, is wrong. Now is not the time for partisanship. For us to get through this, we must remember that the enemy is the coronavirus, not each other. During times of crisis, America has persevered when we stood together. In order for us to protect public health and defeat this deadly virus, we have to use common sense, respect science and listen to medical experts. Their advice is to continue practicing social distancing, wearing a cloth mask if you have to leave your home and staying at home when you’re sick. People have a constitutional right to protest. This includes the right to carry signs with hateful slogans and swastikas, and wave confederate flags. You can carry semi-automatic weapons inside our State Capitol. And you can even exercise these constitutional rights against the expense of your own health, and the health of the police officers there to protect you. While Michiganders have those rights, we also have the right to speak out against that behavior, and stand with the vast majority of Michiganders who do not agree with their actions. The protesters in Lansing have been unsafe for so many reasons, and disturbing to watch. Their actions are putting every Michigander, and every community across our state, at risk. We should be working together to find ways to help and protect our fellow Michiganders. We also need to face the facts: Michigan is one of the states with the most deaths due to COVID-19. Our Governor is taking difficult – but necessary – actions to slow the spread of this deadly virus. Together, we will get through this. I’m going to continue focusing on my work in Congress to pass legislation that helps to minimize the health and economic impact of this pandemic for all Michiganders. Dan Congressman Dan Kildee – a Flint native – is proud to represent Michigan’s Fifth District. As a Democratic party leader, Dan is fighting hard to ensure every American has access to quality health care, clean water and a good-paying job. The path to protect the Democratic majority in the House runs right through the Midwest, and as Heartland Engagement Chair, Dan's job is to protect and elect Democratic candidates.

Sadly, the political rally we all witnessed at our State Capitol in Lansing was disturbing. I certainly respect everyone's First Amendment rights, including the right to protest their government. To see protesters not following health guidelines puts every Michigander, and every community across our state, at risk. Their selfish actions also were disrespectful to the police who were required to protect them and every health care worker on the frontlines saving lives. I hope that everyone who attended yesterday’s political stunt in Lansing remains healthy and safe. But let’s face it: after their demonstration, protesters got back into their cars and drove home, not knowing if they themselves are now carriers of COVID-19 virus in their communities for days and weeks to come. Their actions will likely mean that a stay at home order will be necessary even longer in Michigan. We have to face the facts: Michigan is one of the states with the most COVID-19 cases. As of today, over 2,000 of our fellow Michiganders have died. Our Governor, Gretchen Whitmer, is taking difficult – but necessary – actions to slow the spread of this deadly virus. We are all in this together. This is tough and frustrating, but we have to use common sense, respect science and listen to the medical experts. To the vast majority of Michiganders who are staying at home to save lives, thank you for doing your part. If you haven’t taken my coronavirus check-in survey yet, you can do so here→ Tell Me More Together, we will get through this and I am committed to doing everything I can to minimize the health and economic impact of this for all Michiganders.

With just 10 days to go until Election Day, let us give you 10 reasons why you should support Adam in the final stretch to make sure we win on Nov. 3. View this email in your browser Alex, There’s A LOT at stake in this election: our health, our rights, and the literal survival of our planet and democracy . With just 10 days to go until Election Day, let us give you 10 reasons why you should support Adam in the final stretch to make sure we WIN on Nov. 3. 1\. He would be the youngest person in Congress. At age 27, Adam is the youngest Dem congressional nominee in the country. And if elected, would be the youngest sitting Congressperson. Let’s invest in the next generation of progressive changemakers. 2\. Adam will stand up for working families. Growing up in post-Recession Indianna, Adam saw firsthand how corporate greed destroyed working and middle class communities. That’s why in Congress, he’ll always stand up to special interests and fight for working people. 3\. He will fight for middle-class tax cuts — including cost-saving, common sense health and education solutions like Medicare for All and Universal Pre-K. Will you donate $10 today to send Adam to Congress? CHIP IN $10 4\. This campaign is helping flip Florida blue. Our race is in a dead heat right now, and so is the state of Florida. If we can flip this district, our victory will help ensure Donald Trump is defeated in Florida and becomes a one-term president. 5\. He will protect the environment and ensure no one gets left behind. Adam supports the Green New Deal to make sure that our community and environment survive for future generations. 6\. He has a plan to create over 30,000 good-paying green jobs in FL-3. Adam believes everyone deserves a good union job with a living wage. 7\. Adam will fight for dignity and justice for all. From comprehensive immigration and criminal justice reforms, to caring for our veterans and people with disabilities, Adam will fight to ensure that in the wealthiest country on earth, everyone is treated fairly and gets a dignified life they deserve. Will you donate $10 today to help us get out the vote in the last 10 days of our campaign? CHIP IN $10 8\. He will fight to end predatory business practices. Adam’s day job is catching corporate fraud. From cash bail to Big Pharma price-gouging, Adam will stand up to greedy corporations that cheat and rip off working people everyday. 9\. He will fight for small business. Adam successfully started two companies on his own, and knows the struggle of small business owners trying to provide good benefits for their employees while growing their businesses. That’s why he’ll fight to make Medicare for All a reality, and will make sure the federal government provides direct investment and assistance to help small businesses thrive. 10\. He has the cutest dog! Look at his pomsky puppy Pummel! Will you chip in $10, or whatever you can to help us get out the vote and win this race? With the election just 10 days away, your contribution now will make an immediate impact >> Thank you for supporting Adam throughout this campaign.

I hope everyone got to see my letter to the editor in the Dillon Herald Melissa Watson Logo MWW Letter To The Editor Dillon Herald: Letter To The Editor “My name is Melissa Ward Watson, and I am running for Congress in SC Congressional District 07. Never in a million years did I think I would run for the House of Representatives because I always viewed running for office as someone else’s responsibility. What changed? Storms started coming more frequently, flooding started happening a little too often, the quality of our roads began to deteriorate, and poverty levels kept climbing. That is when I knew I had to do something. I grew up in the quaint community of Dillon where I graduated from high school in 1995. My parents, Hezekiah Ward, Jr. and Mary Ann Smiling Ward, were hardworking people just like all the people in Congressional District 07. My sisters and I were raised in a household where both parents earned a living wage that provided for our family. We were not rich, but we managed to have a respectable lifestyle in a respectable community. Imagine my surprise when I recently learned that of the 3 poorest counties of the state, 2 are in District 07. One of those is the town in which I grew up. The other is the town where my father was raised. The same statistic is true when it comes to education and infrastructure. As I was driving through the area just yesterday, I was concerned about the rising water levels of the Great Pee Dee River. Once again, it had overflowed its banks. Years ago this was a rarity. Today, flooding is commonplace. Flooding is just one of the many issues we face. Healthcare, education, infrastructure, and women’s health are other issues that are of deep concern to me. These are the reasons why I am running for Congress, and these are the reasons why I am running now. We can not afford two more years of Tom Rice. We need leadership right now that is going to hold Washington accountable and bring common sense solutions to help our everyday families and businesses right here in South Carolina. The problems facing our communities don’t just affect Democrats or Republicans or Independents or people that don’t vote. They affect all of us, and I’m going to Washington to make sure that we can finally get our families and our communities the leadership they deserve. Please join me on this journey.” We need a bold leader like Melissa who will fight for everyday people. Pitch in now to support Melissa Watson.

Friend, South Carolina is currently experiencing the third worst COVID-19 outbreak in the world. Things are so bad that Taiwan donated 92,000 surgical masks to our frontline healthcare workers, because we are failing to keep them safe. Friend, I’m gonna keep it real: This is a disgrace. Our state’s refusal to address this health crisis has cost thousands of lives, and there is no end in sight. Our leaders are STILL failing us. Earlier this week, Gov. McMaster ordered schools to reopen for in-person classes in the fall, despite warnings from superintendent Molly Spearman, the Palmetto State Teachers Association, South Carolina Education Association, SC for Ed, and the American Association of Pediatrics. And incredibly, South Carolina STILL doesn’t have a mask mandate in place! Even Alabama has issued a mandate to wear face masks in public. This isn’t just about common sense — it’s about common decency. Everyone should be wearing a mask right now — if not for yourself, then for your loved ones, your neighbors, and your community. The CDC is predicting that we could get this virus under control in just 4 to 8 weeks if we all wear masks — yet our own congressman, Rep. Ralph Norman, continues to walk on the House floor without one. Friend, I’m angry. I’m angry because I’ve seen the human toll of COVID-19 firsthand — I lost my granny to this virus in April — and I know that we can prevent other families from feeling the pain that I felt. All we have to do is put politics aside and come together as a South Carolina community. But as angry as I am, I’m not giving up. I will keep working to build the kind of grassroots movement that can elect better leaders for our state. That’s what this all comes down to — a better South Carolina. A stronger community. We will get there. Thanks for standing with me, — Moe DONATE * * * Moe Brown served as team captain for the USC Gamecocks and brought 5,000 jobs to the state through his work with the Department of Commerce.

Now more than ever, we're committed to fighting for the people of TX-21 and ensuring everyone has what they need to stay safe and healthy. Alex – In this time of great uncertainty for our country and Texas communities, we need to remember one thing: We have weathered great crises in the past, and it’s our hope and compassion that will get us through each day in the present. That’s why I’m running for Congress: to make sure every Texan has equal opportunity to thrive, and to ensure the people of TX-21 have a representative that will tackle tough problems with compassion, common sense and decency. Beating a GOP incumbent in Texas is no easy task, but I can’t sit by and watch as people like my opponent, Chip Roy, vote against the health and safety of our communities, putting vulnerable lives on the line. When a vital vote recently came up to make sure Texas families get the support they need to help weather the coronavirus pandemic, Chip voted against the bill – despite overwhelming bipartisan support, including from the president. This was a vote against small businesses, against unemployment benefits and paid sick leave, and against providing access to free testing for the virus. While this was perhaps his most dangerous vote against the people of TX-21 yet, it’s an all too frequent pattern from Chip Roy. He’s voted against bipartisan legislation to lower prescription drug costs, saying he was “glad” drug companies “made a lot of money.” He single-handedly delayed vital disaster relief aid last year, $4 billion of which was headed to Houston for families and businesses hurt by Hurricane Harvey. And, in the face of millions losing their jobs and health care, he still wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. The facts speak for themselves: Chip Roy can’t be relied on to do what’s right for the Texans he swore to serve. I promise to do the opposite, and by following one simple rule: If a policy makes people worse off or senselessly pushes the most vulnerable to the side – I’ll work my heart out to defeat it. And if a policy helps the people who are relying on me to fight for them, I’ll spend my every waking moment making it happen. Because that’s what the people of this district, this state and this country deserve – especially in a time of crisis. Chip Roy has unequivocally failed this basic test. But ousting Chip Roy and flipping TX-21 blue is going to take major resources – especially with all the lobbyist and corporate PAC money lining Chip’s campaign coffers. We’ve set a goal to raise another $4,500 by midnight tonight. Please, will you give $10 now to defeat Chip, flip this Texas district blue and expand our House majority? DONATE $10 DONATE $25 DONATE $50 Other Texas families deserve an elected leader that will fight head-on for them in times of crisis. I’ll be that leader, and you can bet that I’ll fight as hard for your kids and grandkids as I would for my own precious granddaughters. I’m keeping you all close to my heart and in my prayers in these trying times.

As a professor, I value education, and as a state senator, I will fight for our students and schools. Can you help? View this email in your browser Dear Friend, As parents send their children off to school this week, we think of their year ahead and wonder what the future holds. There is a lot of uncertainty in our schools right now. As an educator myself, I know. Unfortunately, our Governor and Republican Senate leadership are refusing to hold a special session to spend funds allocated to us through the CARES Act. While other states are providing additional grants of tens of millions of dollars to K-12 and higher education to address COVID-19 related expenses, South Dakota allows $900 million of stimulus money to go unspent. The Congressional legislation says it must be spent by December 31, 2020. We can do better! We need strong voices in Pierre who will stand up for our students and our schools. As a state senator on the appropriations committee, I fought to follow the law and ensure teachers received 2% cost of living adjustments this year. I have sponsored and supported bills to fund an early childhood education council, and I have passed bills to help our deaf and hard of hearing students get the educational services they deserve. I know you share my values for education in South Dakota. With the election only 68 days away, and absentee voting beginning in 22 days, we need to reach out to our voters now. Can you chip in $25 dollars to help keep a thoughtful, responsible, and effective policymaker in our state senate? We need common sense leadership now more than ever. Together, we can create a South Dakota that works for ALL of us. Sincerely, Reynold F.

Not only do the latest polls show him leading Martha McSally by 7 points, but the Cook Political Report has updated their rating of Arizona’s presidential contest to “Lean Democrat.” But Martha McSally is willing to take dark money and rely on Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump’s campaign cash to hold onto a seat she couldn’t even win in the first place.

A critical update on the ACA for you: Recently, the House passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act, a bill from Congressman Scott Peters, which builds on the Affordable Care Act by keeping premiums down, expanding access and affordability for our community. No American should ever have to choose between health care and basic necessities — especially as we face the most dangerous global health pandemic in modern history. This is common sense to most. But just over a week ago, President Trump asked the Supreme Court to Strike down the ACA in its entirety. We should enhance our existing health care system, not dismantle it. If you agree, sign on to show your support for the ACA and the Affordable Care Enhancement Act » COVID-19 is far from defeated in the United States, so it is absolutely necessary that Americans have access to affordable health care right away.

Today marks the 50th anniversary of Earth Day -- a time for us to reflect on how far we've come and how far we still have to go. # At a time when so many are facing hardship and uncertainty, we understand if you cannot afford to donate right now. We are just grateful to be in this fight with you. Senator Markey and all of us on Team Markey are here for you — fighting for you. We will get through this together. * * * Alex - Today marks the 50th anniversary of Earth Day — a time for us to reflect on how far we’ve come and how far we still have to go. Donald Trump and the fossil fuel industry are posing massive threats to our planet. They’re ignoring all of the warnings from climate scientists that we are quickly running out of time to save our planet. The need to pass the Green New Deal has never been more urgent, and the good news is that our climate army has never been stronger. We must keep fighting and organizing, and I need your help to do that. Will you make a $3 donation to my campaign today to help me continue leading the fight for the Green New Deal in the Senate? We can win this fight, but I cannot do it alone. When Earth Day started, climate change wasn’t yet in our lexicon. I began sounding the alarm of a warming planet at the Democratic National Convention 40 years ago, and at the time, I was a lonely voice in this fight. But with your help, we’ve made immense progress. Now our movement has the chance to win this fight once and for all with the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal is just common sense. The planet is warming. The storms are getting more dangerous. This is our chance to unleash a green revolution. There has never been a more urgent or necessary moment for this revolution. As we look to recover from this pandemic, the Green New Deal sets a blueprint for how we save our planet and stimulate our economy. The Green New Deal will create millions of good-paying jobs in a way that puts frontline communities first. Black and Brown families have always breathed different air than white families in our country. They’ve borne the brunt of the most consequential effects of climate change and coronavirus, and they must be at the center of our fight to save the planet and our economy. And when I win this race, that is what we are going to do together. My promise is that we will pass the Green New Deal in my next term. But I’m counting on you to join me in the trenches. Make a $3 donation to my campaign today to make sure we win this race. We have come so far in the past 50 years, and we cannot let our opponents and the fossil fuel industry stop our progress now.

Friends, I hope you are having a wonderful holiday season and that you are enjoying the blessing of friendship and family. April and I enjoyed Christmas with our four daughters and family but are now turning our full attention to Iowa. The Iowa caucuses are only 32 days away and I want to fill you in on our plans. On January 3rd, April and I kick off our “From Montezuma to Tripoli” tour with an event in Tripoli, Iowa. From there our campaign bus (nicknamed “big blue”) will make 40 stops across rural Iowa communities that no other campaign visit and end in Montezuma, Iowa on January 27th. Our only break will be a few trips to the Granite State of New Hampshire for some important events and town halls. Our Iowa trip is themed around “sending a message” to the Democratic Party that our country needs a moderate, economic focused, problem solver to beat Trump and start getting Washington working again. The trip will highlight several important issues, including: The Rural Economy: Creating jobs in rural America is one of the central challenges of our time, and we’ve invested the time and have the vision to do just that. As legendary Iowa journalist Chuck Offenburger said in his endorsement of me (Delaney is the Real Deal): “There’s not been any other candidate who’s come even close to Delaney in how he’s worked Iowa in this election cycle.” I’m committed to rural America and on this trip, I will be asking rural Iowa to caucus for me and send a message to the DNC that our party is not just about the coasts! Healthcare: Pulitzer prize-winning Iowa journalists Art Cullen called my BetterCare healthcare plan “the best plan out there.” On the debate stage, I was the first candidate to point out the flaws in the Medicare For All proposal and since then almost all the major candidates have followed my lead and backed away from proposals that eliminate private health insurance as an option. The problem is, most of them don’t have a vision for universal healthcare which is what our country needs. I’m committed to building a common sense universal healthcare plan and I'm asking Iowans to caucus for me if that’s what they think we need! Jobs: Trump is going to run on the economy and while most of the other candidates are talking about impeachment, class warfare or upending the entire economic model of the United States, I will be talking about “jobs, jobs, jobs.” My dad was a union electrician and he taught me the only political lesson I will ever need: “if you care about workers, vote for the Democrat.” I want to get the Democratic Party back to that message. As the only candidate in the Iowa caucus who was a leader in business and served in Congress, I known how to create jobs with good pay. So I'm asking Iowans to caucus for me if they want the Democratic Party to be the party of jobs! You have been an amazing supporter and a great friend to our campaign. But we need your help one last time. If you want to see the tour schedule and participate in an event, click here. If you want to support our fundraising goal for the month so that we can get our message out, please click here. We have a $500,000 goal for January and we need your help in getting there.

My far-right opponent’s ad just went up, and it’s as bad as you think. Kim Olson for Congress Alex, GOP frontrunner and former Trump administration official Beth Van Duyne just released her newest ad. In it, she refers to immigrants as “criminal illegals” and claims the Democrats want to open our borders to violent felons. She claims she’ll bring common sense back to Washington, but if history tells us anything, it's that she’s more likely to bring her extremist, fear-mongering crusade against immigrants of all backgrounds to Congress. We need to fight back against the hate and lies. We have our own message to share with voters -- one that focuses on what brings us together, not divides us.

Common sense. Kim Olson for Congress We’re sending out emails to remind you why Kim decided to run for Congress, but before we get into the second email of our series, can you make a $5 donation to this campaign today to help us hit our end-of-quarter goal? We’re $7,939 short! DONATE Alex, Here’s what makes sense to us: It just makes sense for Texas to expand Medicaid, because when our families are healthy, our schools are healthy, our economy is healthy and our future is brighter. It just makes sense to take weapons of war off our streets, because our children shouldn’t have to go to school scared that their school will be the next to make national headlines for the worst reason. It just makes sense to take urgent action to slow the threat of climate change, because our future generations have a right to clean air, water, food and life. In Congress, Kim is going to put common sense before politics. If you need proof, just look at her resume. Things that we all take for granted today, Kim had to fight for. The women who pilot fighter jets in combat zones are able to serve their country because of barriers Kim broke. In the Pentagon, Kim was put in charge of modernizing the Air Force’s policy on sexual assault, making systemic change where it was so badly needed. And when these women veterans come home, an organization that Kim led will be there to help them make the jump from the military to the civilian world. Here’s what you can count on: Kim won’t back down, she’ll work across the aisle to get real change accomplished, and she’ll be a warrior for the people of TX-24. But right now we need your help. We still just under $8,000 away from our end-of-quarter goal with just two days remaining to make up the ground. So, if you’re able to, please make a donation to our campaign today to make sure Kim is our nominee and we flip TX-24 in November.

Today, the Supreme Court issued a ruling stating that employment discrimination protections apply to LGBTQ+ individuals! This historic news now cements into law that people cannot be fired for being g Friend, Today, the Supreme Court issued a ruling stating that employment discrimination protections apply to LGBTQ+ individuals! This historic news now cements into law that people cannot be fired for being gay or transgender -- a crucial step forward in the fight for LGBTQ+ equality. But even with this historic ruling, gay and transgender people still face rampant discrimination. Just two days ago, the Trump administration reversed non-discrimination protections for transgender individuals seeking health care or health insurance coverage. In other words, health insurance companies can choose not to cover, and doctors can choose not to treat, gay and transgender people. SIGN: Tell Trump health care is no place for discrimination That is unacceptable. As a doctor, I believe that LGBTQ+ health care is health care \-- no exceptions. I’m proud to work at a non-profit, community health clinic designated as a LGBTQ+ Health Care Equity Leader by the Human Rights Campaign. I’m dedicated to fighting for equality in the care that all clinicians provide. The protections the law has extended to the workplace must extend to our health care system. That’s why I’m stepping up to demand that Congress fight back against the Trump administration’s health care equality rollbacks. And if you agree, I’m asking you to add your name and make your voice heard. >> Sign the petition June is Pride month.

When I launched Serve America ahead of the 2018 midterms, my goal was to elect a new generation of service-driven leaders to public office with an authentic commitment to their communities and our cou Team, When I launched Serve America ahead of the 2018 midterms, my goal was to elect a new generation of service-driven leaders to public office with an authentic commitment to their communities and our country. These public servants made our House majority possible, and they are leading the charge to expand and strengthen that majority this November. That’s why I was so proud to endorse Dr. Pritesh Gandhi in this primary season. The perspective and expertise he gained from a lifetime of service is exactly what we need more of in Congress. For the past four months, Dr. Gandhi has donned Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) every day and treated COVID-19 patients in his East Austin clinic. As the Associate Chief Medical officer of a non-profit, federally qualified public health center, Dr. Gandhi largely serves uninsured and underinsured members of your community who work in essential businesses—they’re cashiers at grocery stores, meat packaging workers, and day laborers. The patients Dr. Gandhi sees are your neighbors, and in many cases the thing that binds them together is non-existent or insufficient health insurance and inadequate access to health care. For the better part of two decades Dr. Gandhi has spent every day fighting to improve each and every community that he called home. And, in that fight, he has picked up the stories of the people he has fought for along the way— the man with pancreatic cancer who was repeatedly denied testing or the immigrant mother whose family lives every day under threat of deportation or the community fighting for access to clean drinking water. You can count on Dr. Gandhi to bring these stories with him to Congress next year, where he will cut through the partisan rhetoric to amplify the voices of the people we all aspire to serve. I’m proud to stand with Dr. Gandhi and eager to work with him in Washington, but I need your help to get him there. His runoff election is on Tuesday!

DO NOT INGEST TOXIC CHEMICALS Gandhi For TX Logo Ingesting Toxic Tweet Hello, As a trained public health professional and physician, it’s my responsibility to inform the public that there is absolutely no truth or scientific evidence to back Donald Trump’s idea that COVID-19 patients may benefit from being injected with disinfectants. But as a human being with common sense, I’m outraged that I would even have to state that in response to such flagrantly irresponsible and negligent statements from the President of the United States suggesting that patients be injected with toxic chemicals. Donald Trump has no regard for the dangerous consequences of his comments. Whether or not he tries to defend them as “jokes," there has been nothing remotely funny about Trump’s attitude and response to the COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed over 51,000 American lives. While healthcare workers continue to risk their safety every day to treat the coronavirus, Trump continues to ignore the advice of healthcare officials, including Dr. Fauci, who Trump has taunted and threatened to fire for not agreeing with his methods. The American public needs Dr. Fauci to counter Trump’s haphazard response efforts and ignorant misinformation regarding COVID-19. We must protect Fauci's job so that he can continue to give us the facts that will help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

I can't express what that moment meant to me as a son of immig Friends -- Almost 12 years ago my immigrant grandmother voted for the first time as an American. She cast her mail-in ballot for then Senator Obama. I can’t express what that moment meant to me as a son of immigrants, as a native Houstonian, to see her on that rocking chair, in her pink housecoat, filling out that ballot for O-B-A-M-A. Her story was wrapped in complexities - lost her mother at a young age, fought mental illness most of her life, raised 4 children in a new land, struggled with diabetes. And yet, she was the most confident, matter of fact person I knew. Loved Marvin Zindler (Houstonians get this), the Houston Rockets, and her grandchildren - in that order. Her story is the American story. I’m on the ballot as a Democratic candidate for the US Congress in Texas’ 10th Congressional District. And like my grandmother, I won’t mince words. Our nation suffers because we lack diversity in DC, not just of race and ethnicity, but also of professional experience. I am a public service physician, lead a nonprofit health clinic, and have dedicated my life to working at the intersection of social justice, public health, and poverty. There is no guarantee of the outcome for the democratic experiment that defines America. But, my grandmother knew that her vote mattered. That in her vote, she had the power to hold this nation accountable to its founding values of justice and freedom. This is a moment in our nation’s history that calls for electing experts to leadership. I'm so grateful that all of you have been in this fight with our campaign over the past 18 months. If you haven’t gotten out and voted yet, now is the time. Polls are open until 7 PM tonight. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

I like to think of myself as a pretty even tempered man, but right now I couldn't be more angry. Friend, I like to think of myself as a pretty even-tempered man, but right now I couldn’t be more angry. In the midst of this pandemic, as cases continue to rise each day in Texas, our state officials are moving forward with their lawsuit to repeal the Affordable Care Act. If they’re successful, 23.3 million Americans will lose access to health care -- including 2 million Texans. Sign now: Hands off the ACA >> It’s no secret that things are getting worse here on the ground in Texas. As a frontline physician, I can tell you firsthand that we’re nowhere near the end of this pandemic. The reckless steps taken by our state officials to reopen our state, without basic public health interventions funded and implemented, have created a surge in COVID-19 cases. Numerous Texas cities now lead the nation in rising COVID-19 cases, including several parts of our TX-10 district. Even this morning -- we received news that the Trump administration is pulling COVID-19 resources from Houston! Where are our Texas leaders, friend?? For Texas to persevere and get through this pandemic, we need elected officials who will prioritize the health and wellbeing of our citizens -- not the whims of corporations and special interests. As our state officials move forward with this lawsuit to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and begin briefings in court tomorrow, I will be fighting alongside you. I’m running for Congress because I’m sick and tired of seeing our politicians play fast and loose with the lives of Texans.

Why Pritesh is the fighter we need: Dr. Gandhi is a safety-net physician and national advocate for frontline workers, and he’s running for Congress on a progressive platform of expanding health care coverage and protecting coverage for pre-existing conditions, and fighting for a woman’s right to choose. Can we count on you to join our team? DONATE » * * * Friend, The moment we’re in has exposed our broken health care system and Republican efforts to further undermine it. Frontline workers, like Pritesh, are recycling their PPE or going without it altogether as they battle a pandemic that could have been prevented. It’s a moment that demands a fighter, friend -- for Texas and for our nation. Why Pritesh is the fighter we need: Dr. Pritesh Gandhi is a physician and community leader who has made it his priority to fight for families most vulnerable to the coronavirus. His clinic serves over 20,000 uninsured and underinsured Texans: people who often can’t afford health care or prescription drugs and who oftentimes are on the frontlines of the pandemic themselves, from grocery store cashiers to people who deliver groceries. As a doctor, he fights day in and day out -- both to make sure his community stays healthy and to demand that doctors and nurses all across the country get the protective equipment they need. His public health background has made him a critical voice in this time of crisis, as he’s using his national platform to demand increased testing and contact tracing. [Watch now] What Dr. Gandhi is fighting for: Dr. Gandhi is running on a progressive platform informed by his life and work experience. Every day, he sees children and parents in his clinic who can’t afford health insurance. He sees the social, economic, legal, and political determinants of health play out in his exam room. And as a doctor in the middle of a pandemic, he knows we have to be prepared for the next time a pandemic hits. That’s why he’s fighting for lower prescription drug prices and to expand Medicaid in Texas so every American can afford to receive high quality health care. That’s why he’s fighting to expand affordable housing and build a fairer and more compassionate immigration system. And that’s why he’s using his platform to demand that we restore and expand our pandemic preparedness response program, not slash it like the Trump administration has done.

Hey friend, Did you get a chance to read Dr. Gandhi’s email from yesterday? Honestly, I’ve never seen him more fired up than he’s been over the last couple days. As a physician, and one who particularly focuses his practice on helping our most vulnerable Texans, he’s absolutely furious at our state leaders for their dismissal of this public health crisis. More than just about anyone, Dr. Gandhi sees the real human impact of these shameful political actions in his clinic on a regular basis. I know that if we can bring him to Congress, we’ll finally be able to turn the tide on these bad actors. Will you help us get him there?

Our leaders have failed us, friend. With COVID-19 cases rising at a previously unseen speed in our state -- our elected officials continue to miss (or ignore) the memo that it’s time to get serious about health care. After recklessly re-opening our state at a speed, our medical community warned against, they’re spending this week filing briefings to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and strip health care away from millions of Texans.

Friend, Over the past few weeks our campaign has listened and learned from the narratives and experiences of Black communities across this district and nation. Resiliency, trauma, strength, collective spirit -- it pains me that decades after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, we, as a nation, have only just begun the process of truth and reconciliation. Understanding history is a part of this process. On this day, in 1865, over 250,000 enslaved Black Americans received word that they were declared legally free. After centuries of oppression, the resiliency and individual agency of Black America would not be denied. Whether in Congress or in statehouses around the south, Black political leadership grew, even in the face of constant threats. We should honor the offspring of enslaved Black Americans who have continued to provide light in times of darkness. Quite literally, Americans such as Lewis Latimer (invented the carbon light bulb filament) to Garrett Morgan (invented the three-light traffic light) have powered our society. Black history, black innovation, black agency - this part of our history does not get taught, and therefore, we must not let up the fight for justice. Juneteenth must serve as a reminder that, though emancipation is a cause for celebration, it also serves as a cause for reflection: the struggle for equal rights under law continues to this day. We must not fill these spaces with empty promises. We must continue to fight for equity in our criminal justice system with the understanding that Black lives matter. We must fight for equal access to education, housing, health care, and a fair economic system. Last week our campaign released Part I of our Civil Rights Act for the 21st century. We will continue to release subsequent parts in the coming weeks. This is my commitment to you, that I will fight to end racist and discriminatory practices against Black communities and people of color in our nation. Thank you, Dr. Pritesh Gandhi Dr. Pritesh Gandhi is a Houston born, first-generation American, Fulbright scholar, and physician. As a primary care doctor for the underserved, Dr. Gandhi has seen firsthand the critical need for expanded health care access that is both quality and affordable. In Congress, he will strive to keep science-based solutions and common sense above political grandstanding. * * * Congress is in need of a check-up -- help us send a doctor to Congress!

We’re seeing record hospitalizations, ICUs in major metro areas are at or near capacity, and the problem is getting worse each passing day. Simply put, this is bad. Here is the thing, folks: It didn’t have to be this way. Our Governor here in Texas issued a mask order only yesterday, something that should have been done weeks prior. And earlier this week, our Lt. Governor openly bragged about ignoring Dr. Fauci. Given the poor leadership modeled by the federal government, why should we expect any different? This pandemic has underscored the need for more scientists and public health experts at the highest levels of our government. Folks, if you believe, like I believe, that we need more public health experts in Congress, click here to watch today’s interview with Brooke Baldwin on CNN and chip in to our campaign. Click here to watch the interview and chip in to send a doctor to Congress >> At the close of the interview, Brooke asked me about people gathering for this fourth of July weekend. Folks, this is tough, but I told her that the most patriotic thing you can do is stay home and if you do go out -- please wear a mask and maintain social distance.

Senator Harris stands with Dr. Gandhi because he is a fighter for his patients and their families, but she needs your help to get him to Washington. Chip in now >> Friend, When I think of someone who is a fighter for the people, I think of someone like Dr. Gandhi. That’s why he’s earned my endorsement in this race. He is on the frontlines in the middle of a national pandemic treating COVID-19 patients at his nonprofit health clinic in East Austin. Dr. Gandhi knows his duty to his patients extends beyond the walls of the exam room. That’s why he has spent his entire adult life in public service. He has testified on paid sick leave at the Capitol, rallied for a women’s right to choose, and two years ago, led a movement of health care professionals at the border in Tornillo to stand up for those children separated from their families. He isn’t about ideology, he is about action. It’s why he started a group, “Doctors Against Gun Violence,” lectured around the nation on climate change and early childhood education, and has worked on initiatives ranging from microfinance for women-headed small business to micro-nutrient supplementation for children living in poverty. And, this November, Dr. Gandhi is going to be elected to the United States Congress, so he can continue to fight for his patients and their families. But, I need your help to get him there. Dr. Gandhi faces a critical FEC fundraising deadline at the end of the month and needs your support. Will you make a contribution to Dr. Gandhi today and send him to Washington so we can fight side-by-side? Dr. Gandhi is running to replace Congressman Michael McCaul. McCaul is an ardent backer of President Trump and an obstacle in the House to virtually every one of our priorities. Dr. Gandhi is the progressive fighter who can defeat McCaul in November and help make progress in Washington for working people. From paid sick leave and immigration reform to lower prices for prescription drugs and protecting a woman’s right to choose, I know Dr. Gandhi will be a champion for our shared values. I can’t think of anyone better to represent the TX-10 community, especially in the midst of this pandemic, than Dr. Pritesh Gandhi and that’s why I’m so proud to give him my endorsement. * * * Join Senator Kamala Harris in supporting Dr. Pritesh Gandhi for Congress by giving a donation now >> If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: GIVE $5 » GIVE $25 » GIVE $50 » GIVE $100 » Custom donation » * * * As a frontline physician and community health advocate, Dr. Gandhi has the skills to bring common sense reforms to Washington that will strengthen health care access for all families.

View this email in your browser Alex, Everything is on the line in this election—health care for more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, Dreamers’ ability to remain in the only country they’ve ever known, our chance to fight back against Big Pharma’s price-gouging, the right to join a [[URL REDACTED]] our very democracy. Right now, Washington works great for the wealthy and well-connected—just not anyone else. But we can change that by electing leaders who will put people first. That is why I am endorsing Isaac McCorkle for Congress. Ike grew up in a working class family with a tough single mom. He understands the struggles of working Americans, and he’s fighting for Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and immediate relief for people who’ve been hit hard by this pandemic and economic crisis. Ike has the courage, candor, and common sense we need in government. But first, this grassroots team needs to send Ike to Washington. Anything you’re able to chip in today will send a clear message that we’ve got Ike’s back and make sure the McCorkle campaign hits its powerfully important fundraising goal by October 23rd: If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Express Donate: $25 Express Donate: $50 Express Donate: $100 Express Donate: $250 Express Donate: $500 Or, donate another amount Alex, Ike’s team has set an ambitious goal for this final stretch to November 3rd, and they need to raise $40,000 in the next twelve days. Anything you give will help power Ike’s organizing and advertising, and help fight back against attacks from Ken Buck and his GOP allies. And because Ike’s campaign is grassroots funded, anything you’re able to give today will make a powerful difference. So if you can pitch in $25 or whatever makes sense for your budget right now, please help power the McCorkle for Colorado campaign to victory right now. We don’t have any time to waste.

I'm honored to receive the endorsement of the National Wildlife Federation. Protecting our environment and our oceans is one of my top priorities. This comes on the heels of a yet another Trump administration attack on the planet. Just last week, Trump bypassed Congress and common sense to reopen more than one million acres of our most pristine public lands in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. It's not complicated: all of these dangerous failed policies boil down to one simple message: corporate profits are worth more than the planet and our families' health. I have always been and will always be an advocate for our public lands, waterways, oceans, and the people, animals, and plant life that rely on them, so I'm honored to have the support of the National Wildlife Federation in this fight. I'm proud to have the support of the National Wildlife Federation in this fight. Join them in supporting this campaign. Chip in $7 right now. Stand with us and let's make it count this November. Donald Trump and his anti-science, anti-environment actions have disastrous consequences that ripple throughout the world. Undoing Trump's damage and then leading with progressive, science-first policies? That sounds a lot better to me. I stand with the National Wildlife Federation. They stand with us. Because we all have a role to play in this struggle. And that's why I'm asking for your support. Because we must win in November and lead with our pro-science, pro-working-families agenda.

As of this week, we’ve started a podcast: On Duty with Amy McGrath. We know that so many folks are going through a challenging time right now. If you’d like to hit pause on these emails while this crisis is at its worst, just let us know here. Team, nothing about this moment is normal—that’s just a fact. This is a tough, scary, uncertain time for a lot of people, and I’m holding so many of you in my thoughts every step of the way. One way we’re keeping things moving, even under these circumstances, is by staying focused on what this campaign is all about: making sure Kentucky has a leader in Washington who truly listens—both to the people she represents, and to the people with the greatest expertise in the challenges we face. That’s why we’ve started a podcast, On Duty with Amy McGrath, in which I sit down (virtually) with policy experts and members of the community to discuss the issues that are driving this election and what we’re trying to achieve for Kentucky. Now more than ever, we need a direction for our country grounded in common sense, compassion, and solidarity—not self-serving political games. I can’t wait for you to hear the conversations we’ve been having—and maybe even get you involved as well. The first episodes are up now.

This public health crisis is already a threat to our democracy—we must act to protect citizens (and their right to vote). We know that so many folks are going through a challenging time right now. If you’d like to hit pause on these emails while this crisis is at its worst, just let us know here. Team, defending our democracy starts with making sure every eligible American has a chance to make his or her voice heard. But that goal is under serious threat from the COVID-19 crisis, which is already forcing election delays as we saw here in Kentucky. In several states, voters were forced to make an unthinkable choice between their ballot and their health. This isn’t one of those problems with no good answer—we have an obvious solution in front of us. And millions of Americans put it to use, safely and effectively, in every election: voting by mail. That’s why I believe it’s critical that states allow every single voter to vote by mail in 2020. If you agree, add your name now and let’s raise our voices together. This isn’t an outlandish ask. It’s common sense, and already common practice in several states and for Americans overseas or those who can’t physically make it to a polling location. I voted by mail for 24 years while I was in the military, and let me tell you: It works just fine. I’m proud that Gov. Beshear is making strides to expand mail-in voting for our primary on June 23. And while I sincerely hope that in-person voting will be possible come November, I have to ask: Honestly, when our democracy is at stake, why leave anything to chance? Voters shouldn’t have to choose between staying safe or voting in this consequential election. Of course, Mitch and his allies have ridiculed the idea of voting by mail—even though many of them frequently take advantage of it themselves. In the middle of a pandemic, we must take aggressive steps to ensure our democratic process is intact without endangering our communities—add your name to my call to expand voting by mail across the country. Thank you, Amy Add Your Name → P.S. Kentucky’s voter registration deadline for our primary election has been extended to May 26—anyone can register or update their registration online right now.

1,400 people have made investments in 2019 in this movement that we’re building together. Wow Alex! We ended 2019 with a bang. 1,400 people have made investments in this movement that we’re building together. People like James from Ludington who gave $50, Keith from Muskegon who gave $25, and Tiannette from Zeeland who gave $13 before the ball dropped and our 2019 fundraising deadline ended. 2020 is a pivotal election year for West Michigan and we’re in a unique opportunity right now to flip Michigan’s 2nd District, and here’s why: First, I have met with hundreds of voters across the District -- many who are Republicans \-- who are fed up with Trump and the GOP. Many Republicans who I have met no longer recognize the Republican Party and are open to a new type of leader… like a pastor from Holland who is pursuing common sense policies. Second, our opponent Representative Bill Huizenga is currently being investigated by the nonpartisan Office of Congressional Ethics for serious campaign spending violations, which makes his seat vulnerable this cycle. Whether or not he is found guilty, Bill’s campaign spending habits call into question his commitment to integrity, transparency, and fiscal responsibility -- all values we pride ourselves on in West Michigan. Third, I can break molds and cross boundaries to connect with voters in West Michigan. As a pastor, former Republican, and child of Dutch immigrants who grew up here, I have a unique ability to connect with voters in West Michigan -- including those who lean conservative. I believe that our shared common values can unite us to work together for the common good. Fourth, we expect to see record Democratic voter turn-out due to the presidential race and Michigan’s new no-reason absentee voting laws. That means we have even more voters to reach and to share our message with before they cast their votes. And finally, we are continuing to build on the powerful foundation created by Dr. Rob Davidson in 2016. Dr. Rob -- who has fully endorsed my campaign for Congress -- ran for Congress in 2016 and laid the foundation that we are continuing to build our movement on. Believe me, we have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but with your support and the support from folks like James, Keith, and Tiannette, I know that we can win this.

The Federal Election Commission just made their reports available... Image Facebook Twitter YouTube Reminder Primary Day has officially been postponed to July 14th! Team Crafts, The Federal Election Commission just made their reports available for the first quarter of this year. The big take away from this report, shows that after just two fundraising quarters our team has $127,623.27 in the bank! I am thrilled to have the support of so many Mainers like you that have made this possible. The trust and encouragement that you have placed in me is very uplifting. We now have the momentum to take us into November! An important thing to note is our campaign has practiced fiscal responsibility, something that our opponent can not say. While my opponent claims to be a fiscal conservative and a small government advocate, I believe his report shows his lack of fiscal responsibility. As a businessman, I am experienced to pay close attention to the numbers, and it is a clear disregard of resources to spend nearly $500,000 (75%) of all his money raised before April 1st. If he can’t maintain a tight budget in his own campaign, how can he possibly be trusted with taxpayer money in Washington? When you make an investment in my campaign, I value and understand how to maximize each dollar to its greatest worth. It’s just what common sense businessmen do. Throughout this campaign, we have continued to build momentum and strength through numbers that go beyond dollars in the bank. Due to my life, legislative and business experience, I have earned the endorsement of the Maine’s strongest conservative voices, Gov. Paul LePage, and others such as Shawn Moody, Garrett Mason, 50 current and former state legislators, 60 sportsmen and women, 50 veterans, 25 pastors.  In addition, I have earned the support of the Family Research Council as the strongest candidate to protect life. Our team is about Mainers that believe in having a strong, experienced message to take to Washington, protecting our conservative values. Here are three important things that we need from Mainers like you to win back this seat: 1) Contribute $5, $25, $100 or any amount that fits your budget. Your contribution will go a long way 2) Forward this email to five friends and share our Facebook page with your friends list. 3) I ask for your VOTE on July 14th or by Absentee Ballot. NOTE: If you want to request an absentee ballot, you can do so right now at [[URL REDACTED]] Let's continue to work together with President Trump and continue to Keep Maine and America Great!

My name is John Cummings. I'm the blue collar, conservative former NYPD cop who grew up in the Bronx. I didn't just parachute in here from the rich burbs, change my name and become a Socialist like AOC. Hi , My name is John Cummings. I'm the blue collar, conservative former NYPD cop who grew up in the Bronx. I didn't just parachute in here from the rich burbs, change my name and become a Socialist like AOC. I'm real, as real as it gets. A real New Yorker, born and raised in our district. Do you remember what it was like on 9/11? The chaos, the violation, knowing innocent people had been attacked and murdered through no fault of their own, just for being who they were. That's what happened on 9/11. I lived and worked in the city then. I was here, I know. You know where AOC was on 9/11? Living in a silver spoon neighborhood in Westchester County. She has no concept of the sacrifices those of us in the City made. The restrictions as they tried to root out the remaining terrorists. The fear, the panic. The resolve as we rebuilt our city. That's right, we rebuilt OUR city! It means something different when you were on the ground all along. Now this limousine liberal Socialist from the burbs is content to come here and tear our city down. It breaks my heart. She chased away 25,000 jobs from Amazon that we needed here in my district. Then she advocates terrorizing the very police officers and first responders that saved our city and rescued so many people on 9/11. She doesn't want to ever admit how valuable the NYPD is for us. How 80% of our residents love the NYPD! But I know better! I grew up here in the Bronx, in Parkchester. I lived all my life here, went to church here, went to school here, was an NYPD cop here, and I want to stay here. It's my home! Even now, she doesn't LIVE here. She has a swanky expensive loft in DC, she lives there. Guess she couldn't go without that silver spoon lifestyle! DONATE TODAY No wonder she has an approval rating under 50%! Even in a Democrat district, we are New Yorkers and we ain't stupid. I'm here on the ground, with my neighbors, and have been for decades. I honor the heroes of 9/11 just like my neighbors do! I will work with my neighbors to defend NYPD against limousine liberals like AOC. Will you help us? That AOC wants to blame the cops who save the citizens of our City is insane. 9/11 proved that beyond dispute. I MUST beat AOC in 2020! If she chases our NYPD away, our district and our city is doomed. This is why less than half the voters in my district even have a favorable opinion of AOC. People here aren't crazy radicals, they're Americans, and they will vote for common sense! New York is coming together behind me. Everyone wants this unserious flake AOC gone! Can you chip in $25, $50, $100, $250, $500, or even $1000 to help me? It's time to beat AOC, for the good of America! Can you help me today? America needs leaders who care about people, including cops. Elect me and I will do just that. DONATE TODAY Thank you for your support, John Cummings Former NYPD Officer | Republican for Congress facebook twitter instagram Cummings for Congress PO Box 624 Shirley, NY 11967 Unsubscribe

# Folks -- Thank you for being on our team! We need a strong showing at the precinct caucuses tomorrow, March 7th, at 2:00pm. Can we count on you to be there? There are hundreds of caucus locations across the state. To find yours: 1. Find your voter registration at [[URL REDACTED]] 2. Find your precinct number under "County & District Information" 3. Search your precinct number at [[URL REDACTED]] to find your caucus location Caucuses are all about friends, neighbors, and communities coming together. An important part of caucusing is helping convince folks to support John. Here are some of the reasons why he’s running for Senate and why he’s the best choice to take on -- and defeat -- Senator Gardner. Remember to speak up and show your support for John in your precinct! As a small businessman and brewer, John has a different view of politics. He’s got a proven record -- as Mayor of Denver and Governor of Colorado -- of bringing people together to get results. He helped take Colorado from 40th in job creation to the number one economy in the nation. When the stakes are this high, John is the right candidate to take on Senator Gardner. Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell are going to spend whatever it takes to try to keep their yes-man in the Senate. But despite the mountains of corporate PAC and dark money backing Gardner, polling shows John beating him in a head-to-head matchup. At a time when Washington is rife with division, John Hickenlooper is the independent problem solver we need in the Senate. Here’s where he stands on some of the issues that matter most to Democratic caucus-goers: * Climate change is the greatest threat of our time. John has a plan to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, bring harmful climate emissions under control, and lead the world on this issue. * Health care is a right, not a privilege. We need to cut costs, get to universal coverage by bringing a public option to the health insurance marketplace, and stop Republicans from gutting protections for preexisting conditions. * We must end the stranglehold the special interests have on Washington. John is not taking a dime of corporate PAC money and will work to overturn Citizens United and shine a light on secret political spending in our elections. * The gun violence epidemic in America must end. We need to pass common sense background checks on gun purchases, close the terrorist loophole, and keep guns out of the hands of convicted criminals, such as domestic abusers. Thank you so much for being one of our most dedicated supporters! See you tomorrow! Team Hick Paid for by Hickenlooper for Colorado P.O. Box 18886, Denver, CO 80218 Unsubscribe here

# Hello — The coronavirus outbreak is forcing all Americans to adapt to new at-home routines, from YouTube workouts to conference calls, home schooling, and video chats with our friends across the street and across the country. Our democracy is no different. Every eligible voter should be able to make their voice heard in our elections without facing the long lines, crowds, and health risks of in-person polling places. Now is the time to recognize the impact this pandemic is having on our elections and democracy, and come together to address it before it’s too late: If you agree, sign my urgent petition demanding President Trump and Congress work together to ensure that every American can vote by mail in the 2020 election and beyond. ADD YOUR NAME If you saw what happened in Wisconsin’s elections on Tuesday, you saw a system that was fundamentally flawed. Local election officials and volunteers, typically seniors, were desperately hunting down sanitizer while hundreds of polling places were closed due to health concerns — but Republicans still fought tooth and nail to stop Wisconsin’s Governor Evers from postponing the election to protect the public’s health. It was sheer chaos! There’s got to be a better way to protect public health and our democracy. And in fact, we’ve already found one here in Colorado where we’ve been voting from home by mail for the last few years. It’s time to bring that system nationwide and use Colorado as a model for our country once again. Sign my petition if you agree we need vote by mail in every state for the 2020 elections. ADD YOUR NAME Universal vote at home reform is simply common sense. Unfortunately, common sense does not prevail very often in Washington. To that I say: it’s time we make Washington a little more like Colorado. We’ve proven that vote at home reforms work, so why not expand them to the rest of the United States? Our democracy and our public health are too important for anything less. Thanks for taking action to protect our elections. — John Hickenlooper Paid for by Hickenlooper for Colorado Hickenlooper for Colorado PO Box 18886 Denver, CO 80218 United States unsubscribe

# Hi folks! By now, you should have received your ballot in the mail. Election Day is just around the corner, and we’re running out of time to get our ballots in! I’m running for Senate to bring change to Washington. And I can’t wait to beat Cory Gardner. If you’ve already voted: great! If not, mail in your ballot by June 22nd, or put it in a dropbox before 7:00pm on June 30th. If you need a refresher on voting in Colorado — check out the video we just released tonight! Look, I’ve been honored to serve the people of Colorado as mayor and Governor. But this is by far the most important election I’ve run in my life. Your vote is your voice, and every single vote counts. When I was Governor, we replaced two coal-fired plants with wind and solar energy, expanded health care coverage for 500,000 Coloradans, got free long term contraception for women, and passed universal vote by mail into law in Colorado. It’s time to bring some Colorado common sense to Washington to fight climate change, expand health care and lower costs, and get things done — like universal vote by mail in every state! That’s why I’m running, and why I need your vote. There are only 12 days left before your ballot is due. Time is running out: make your plan to vote today! Together, we will win this election and rebuild our nation and state better than they were before. Thank you for everything, and thank you for voting. — John Paid for by Hickenlooper for Colorado Click here if you would like to receive fewer emails from our campaign.

# It’s caucus day, Colorado! We need all of Team Hick to get out and caucus TODAY so we can get on the ballot and win back this Senate seat. Here’s what you need to know to participate in your precinct caucus today. Caucuses start at 2:00 pm -- but we advise you get there a bit early to check in. There are hundreds of caucus locations across the state. To find yours: 1. Find your voter registration at [[URL REDACTED]] 2. Find your precinct number under "County & District Information" 3. Search your precinct number at [[URL REDACTED]] to find your caucus location Caucuses are all about friends, neighbors, and communities coming together. An important part of caucusing is helping convince folks to support John. Here are some of the reasons why he’s running for Senate and why he’s the best choice to take on -- and defeat -- Senator Gardner. Remember to speak up and show your support for John in your precinct! As a small businessman and brewer, John has a different view of politics. He’s got a proven record -- as Mayor of Denver and Governor of Colorado -- of bringing people together to get results. He helped take Colorado from 40th in job creation to the number one economy in the nation. When the stakes are this high, John is the right candidate to take on Senator Gardner. Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell are going to spend whatever it takes to try to keep their yes-man in the Senate. But despite the mountains of corporate PAC and dark money backing Gardner, polling shows John beating him in a head-to-head matchup. At a time when Washington is rife with division, John Hickenlooper is the independent problem solver we need in the Senate. Here’s where he stands on some of the issues that matter most to Democratic caucus-goers: * Climate change is the greatest threat of our time. John has a plan to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, bring harmful climate emissions under control, and lead the world on this issue. * Health care is a right, not a privilege. We need to cut costs, get to universal coverage by bringing a public option to the health insurance marketplace, and stop Republicans from gutting protections for preexisting conditions. * We must end the stranglehold the special interests have on Washington. John is not taking a dime of corporate PAC money and will work to overturn Citizens United and shine a light on secret political spending in our elections. * The gun violence epidemic in America must end. We need to pass common sense background checks on gun purchases, close the terrorist loophole, and keep guns out of the hands of convicted criminals, such as domestic abusers. Thank you so much for being one of our most dedicated supporters! If you have any questions before or during caucus, please call our caucus hotline at (720) 724-5014. Thank you so much!

# Folks, as our country struggles with an unprecedented public health crisis, we need to make sure we uphold democracy — and protect people’s safety at the same time. While Donald Trump has been attacking vote by mail (even though he voted by mail himself in 2018 AND just last month), Colorado has been successfully voting by mail for years now. No one should have to choose between their health and their Constitutional right to vote. Read John’s message below and then sign our petition to demand vote by mail nationwide in the 2020 election. ADD YOUR NAME Hello — The coronavirus outbreak is forcing all Americans to adapt to new at-home routines, from YouTube workouts to conference calls, home schooling, and video chats with our friends across the street and across the country. Our democracy is no different. Every eligible voter should be able to make their voice heard in our elections without facing the long lines, crowds, and health risks of in-person polling places. Now is the time to recognize the impact this pandemic is having on our elections and democracy, and come together to address it before it’s too late: If you agree, sign my urgent petition demanding President Trump and Congress work together to ensure that every American can vote by mail in the 2020 election and beyond. ADD YOUR NAME If you saw what happened in Wisconsin’s elections on Tuesday, you saw a system that was fundamentally flawed. Local election officials and volunteers, typically seniors, were desperately hunting down sanitizer while hundreds of polling places were closed due to health concerns — but Republicans still fought tooth and nail to stop Wisconsin’s Governor Evers from postponing the election to protect the public’s health. It was sheer chaos! There’s got to be a better way to protect public health and our democracy. And in fact, we’ve already found one here in Colorado where we’ve been voting from home by mail for the last few years. It’s time to bring that system nationwide and use Colorado as a model for our country once again. Sign my petition if you agree we need vote by mail in every state for the 2020 elections. ADD YOUR NAME Universal vote at home reform is simply common sense. Unfortunately, common sense does not prevail very often in Washington. To that I say: it’s time we make Washington a little more like Colorado. We’ve proven that vote at home reforms work, so why not expand them to the rest of the United States? Our democracy and our public health are too important for anything less. Thanks for taking action to protect our elections. — John Hickenlooper Paid for by Hickenlooper for Colorado Hickenlooper for Colorado PO Box 18886 Denver, CO 80218 United States unsubscribe

# Thank you, folks. I am so proud to become your next United States Senator. Tonight, your message is loud and clear — it’s time to put the poisonous politics of this era behind us and come together to move forward. As it looks now, Colorado will have the highest voter turnout of any state in any election in our nation’s history. Clearly, people are saying it’s time to turn the page. It’s time for a different approach. Now it’s time to start solving problems and helping people. And that’s exactly what I intend to do. I want you to know that I am honored by the trust you have placed in me, and I’m deeply committed to the job ahead. We’ve got to get Washington working for everyone. Regardless of which party ends up controlling the Senate, I want you to know that I will work with anyone and everyone to help Coloradans. I’ve always believed it’s my job to represent all Colorado. That’s what it’s going to take to beat this pandemic, tackle climate change, expand health care, work toward racial and social justice, and so much more. There’s a lot to do, and Lord knows the system in Washington is a broken mess. But I’m an optimist. I know this country is ready to begin a new chapter. So tonight, I pledge to you — I will work my heart out for this state that I love. And I will do everything I can to bring common sense and decency to our work. I want to thank Senator Gardner for his service and wish him and his family the very best. And I want to say to everyone that voted for him, I will be your Senator as well. Thank you to my wife Robin and my son Teddy for standing with me and being an essential part of everything I am and everything I do. I can’t thank you enough. Thank you to everyone who volunteered, who endorsed this campaign, put up a sign, talked to a friend, chipped in a few bucks, made phone calls, sent texts, or cast a vote. And thank you to the people of Colorado, for your confidence and trust. I can’t wait to be your Senator. Together, I know we can change Washington. Thank you so much. Let’s get to work. — John DONATE Paid for by Hickenlooper for Colorado Click here if you would like to receive fewer emails from our campaign.

The Committee to Elect Jesse Mermell Friend, My team and I have been checking in with voters across the Fourth District throughout this pandemic to see how you all are doing and what you need. Whether it’s a virtual house party, a community conversation over Zoom, or a simple phone call – we’ve adapted to our new reality and found ways to keep in touch remotely. Here is what I’ve been hearing from all of you – Overwhelming gratitude for our frontline workers. Our health care workers, hospital staff, first responders, grocery store workers, transit workers, postal service workers, and more are going above and beyond during this crisis. People across the Fourth District are hanging signs to say thank you, donating meals, and cheering each evening to express our thanks. $1,200 isn’t enough. This is common sense. A one-time $1,200 stimulus check simply won’t cut it with 26 million Americans out of work. We need a larger, broader stimulus package that includes monthly payments (personally, what Canada is doing with $2000 monthly checks makes sense to me), debt relief, inclusion of our undocumented neighbors, and expansions of social safety net programs. How can I help? This is a question I’ve been hearing from so many. How do we help others who are struggling during this crisis? It is the message that is making me the most grateful and filled with hope - that even with all that’s happening, so many of you are thinking of others. You know you’re amazing, right? We want to help, too. That’s why my team put together a resource bank with local, state, and federal resources. You can check it out here, and please let us know of any resources in your community that we can add. Demand for trustworthy, compassionate leadership. Basically, the exact opposite of what’s coming out of the White House. Each day, the President spews more lies that threaten people’s lives and our ability to recover from this crisis. We need to elect leaders who will tell the truth, listen to science and lead an equitable response that centers the most vulnerable. I want you to know that I’m listening to you. I hear you loud and clear, and I’m inspired by you. I will do everything in my power to get to Washington D.C. so that I can stand up for you and your neighbors, and deliver the bold, progressive results that you deserve. Can I count on you to power our grassroots movement so that I can be your next Congresswoman?

The Committee to Elect Jesse Mermell Friend, There should be a few things that are easy for everyone to agree on, especially right now. Public health comes first. Civic participation should not just be encouraged, but should be easy. Basic stuff, right? You’d think so. And yet, Republicans seem to have no problem risking public health in order to make it harder for people to vote. We saw it a few weeks ago in Wisconsin, where Republicans overturned efforts to switch to mail-in voting to protect public health. It was reckless, and jeopardized people’s lives – and we’ve already seen reports of people getting sick as a result. The context of a global pandemic may be new, but Republicans’ single-minded focus on making it harder for people to vote sure isn’t. Voting rights have been under attack for decades and the Supreme Court’s 2013 decision to gut the Voting Rights Act has only made it worse. These efforts disproportionately and intentionally make it harder for people of color and low-income voters to engage in our democracy. Now we know that Republicans are also willing to risk public health to advance their agenda of voter suppression, and improve their chances at the ballot box. We need change. We need mail-in voting. It’s a common sense approach to keeping voters safe and making voting easier that’s missing even here in deep blue Massachusetts. We need to implement it immediately around the country. In states that do have mail-in voting, we need to expand it by removing restrictions such as witness requirements and establishing no-excuse absentee voting. Beyond mail-in voting, we need to expand participation safely through early voting, same-day registration, online registration, additional polling locations, the elimination of ID requirements, and the dismantling of decades of voter suppression efforts. If you agree that we need serious and immediate action to protect and expand voting rights, join us by signing our petition today.

Alex -- Unlike Donald Trump, this campaign is listening to medical experts. And that would be true even if Al Gross wasn't a doctor and didn't have a masters degree in public health. It's just plain common sense in a global pandemic. Dr. Al has made it clear that our campaign's priority must be protecting the health of staff, volunteers, and residents all across Alaska. That's why we are temporarily suspending our face-to-face field operation and allowing campaign staff and volunteers to work from home. This is a major adjustment in our plan, so we have to ask -- can you chip in $5 or more to help fund our virtual campaign efforts before our mid-month fundraising deadline at midnight? Here's what your donation will help us do: $5 - helps us pay for 50 text messages $10 - helps us pay for 100 text messages $30 - helps pay a monthly cell phone bill for a volunteer $100 - buys a Facebook ad that can reach at least 1,000 voters This crisis is a stark illustration of why it's never mattered more for us to send Dr. Al Gross to the U.S. Senate. Instead of leading and pressuring Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump to take action, Dan Sullivan has been doing nothing, per usual. He wouldn't even stand up to his fellow Republican senators who stopped emergency paid sick leave from being passed. We deserve a new leader, one who will put public health before partisan politics to deliver results. That's Dr. Al Gross -- but it's on us to make sure voters across Alaska know that. Please chip in $5 or more before our mid-month fundraising deadline so we can fund our virtual campaign efforts and work toward winning this battleground U.S. Senate seat.

"Trump could have reopened enrollment for the Affordable Care Act for coronavirus. He chose not to." \- Vox It doesn't take a doctor to understand that access to affordable health care is critically important during a pandemic. It's common sense.  Add your name and join Dr. Al Gross in demanding that Donald Trump reopen enrollment for the Affordable Care Act. SIGN THE PETITION Alex, imagine this: It hasn't been ideal, but you've been getting by without health insurance because your budget was already tight. But now you're starting to worry about the coronavirus outbreak. One major medical bill will bankrupt you. Unfortunately, you can't get health insurance because the enrollment period is closed. For too many Americans -- 27.5 million to be exact, and many here in Alaska -- they don't have to imagine. This is the reality they are facing. And Donald Trump had the chance to right this wrong by opening a special enrollment period -- but he chose not to. After decades working as a surgeon, Dr. Al Gross has seen the devastating effects medical emergencies have on uninsured families. One medical bill bankrupting a household. Or people putting off care until it's too late. Alex, you don't need to be a doctor to see how disastrous it will be if the government turns their back on the millions of Americans who need health insurance in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. It's not too late for the government to start prioritizing the health and well-being of all Americans -- and that starts with re-opening enrollment in the ACA exchanges. Sign our petition right now and demand the Trump administration open a special enrollment period so people can #GetCovered. SIGN THE PETITION In Alaska alone, over 10% of the population is uninsured. If the Trump administration refuses to extend the enrollment period, it will have devastating repercussions across the country -- but the effects will be even more calamitous here in Alaska, where thousands of people are already having to choose between paying astronomical insurance premiums or putting food on the table for their families. Now more than ever, in the middle of a global pandemic, we cannot afford to bar access to health care enrollment. There are lives on the line, and the clock is ticking. Dr. Al Gross is doing his part by signing up to volunteer if needed during the emergency. Now, it's time for Donald Trump and his administration to do their part. The Trump administration has the power to make this right -- and we're calling on them to do so and open a special enrollment period. Add your name in support of the millions needing insurance today.

Alex -- We're reaching out because we saw you haven't signed our petition in support of the 27.5 million Americans who are unable to get health insurance right now. As a global pandemic ravages our country, it has never been more important to expand health care access -- but instead, Donald Trump and his administration have opted not to open health insurance enrollment for the Affordable Care Act. There are tens of thousands of uninsured people in Alaska alone -- which has one of the highest uninsured rates in the country. Dr. Al Gross and Dr. Monica Gross are ready to do whatever it takes to protect our communities -- they've even volunteered to bring their medical expertise to help with the COVID-19 pandemic, if needed. Meanwhile the federal government is sitting back and doing nothing to help the millions of people at risk. Their inaction will kill Americans across the country. It will kill Alaskans right here at home. It's past time for the Trump administration to act. Sign your name right now and demand they reopen health care enrollment immediately.

We need to start preparing NOW for a safe and secure election. Team, This November, it’s important to make sure that no one has to choose between casting a ballot and keeping their family safe and healthy. In order to protect both our democracy and our communities, we need to start preparing NOW for a safe and secure election. It’s unfortunate (but not surprising) that Sen. Cornyn is refusing to take action. He says that if voters “can go to the grocery store they can go to the polls.” All 50 states, including Texas, already allow many people to vote by mail -- and with social distancing in effect across the country it’s not hard to see why it’s only common sense that we should allow everyone to do so now. DONATE TO DEFEAT SEN. CORNYN >> With The Hill reporting that Sen. Cornyn is facing his “toughest race yet,” it’s obvious why he doesn’t want more Texans to vote by mail. But Texans (and all Americans) deserve a senator who puts our physical health and safety ahead of self-interest. I’ve worked my entire life to do what’s right, from flying rescue missions in Afghanistan to taking on both parties and the Pentagon to open ground combat roles to women. That mission will continue in the Senate, and you can bet I’ll never put partisan politics ahead of Texans’ safety. But I need your help to win this race. If you’re able to do so, will you make a donation to my campaign today to help me defeat Sen. Cornyn this November and fight for ALL Texans in the U.S. Senate?

In 1935, Social Security was created to allow older Americans to age with dignity and security. In 1965, Medicare gave seniors better access to health care. In 2020, we must defend these life-saving programs because Donald Trump has said he will slash their budgets if he wins again. That's why I'm asking for your support today, because Democrats across the country are the first line of defense for Medicare and Social Security — but only if we win in November. Donald Trump's latest proposal is a backdoor way of cutting both of these lifeline programs. When he talks about deferring the payroll tax, he's really talking about stealing from our seniors, one paycheck at a time. And when he talks about ending the payroll tax... he means gutting Medicare and Social Security. While Trump goes on the offensive and spouts hate on Twitter, Democrats in Congress are getting to work. Earlier this year, I worked with a bipartisan group in Congress to update the Older Americans Act, which funds vital programs that help our seniors live independently and with dignity. I'm also continuing to address elder fraud and abuse to help protect our aging loved ones. I will always fight to protect the health and safety of our seniors. For the next 81 days, our grassroots energy is critical. Everyone — from our seniors to our kids — is counting on us to win in November, restore competence and common sense, and reject Donald Trump and his enablers.

Thank you to every volunteer and team member who participated in our Weekend of Action, contacting thousands of voters in our District, talking with them about the issues they care about. Here is the latest update from our campaign: Remembering 9/11 Last Friday, we marked 19 years since the attack on September 11, 2001 and remembered the men and women that lost their lives that day. Our country suffered an incredible loss but we also saw the bravery and heroism of the American people. We will never forget what happened or those who lost their lives on that day. New Endorsement - U.S. Chamber of Commerce I'm proud to receive the endorsement of America's business community yesterday.

View this email in your browser Alex, I hope you are doing well and staying healthy. We received some good news this past weekend as Orange County was taken off California's COVID-19 watchlist! While this is exciting, it’s essential we continue to wear masks, practice social distancing, and follow public health guidelines so that we can get Americans back to work and beat this pandemic. This has been a busy week for Team Young. We released our first TV ad and have continued to move full speed ahead reaching out to voters and giving back to our community. Below is an update from our team: Highlighting Gil Cisneros' Broken Promises Today, we released our first television ad. Gil Cisneros pledged to be a moderate Representative, not to take any PAC contributions, and to oppose Nancy Pelosi’s run for Speaker of the House. He broke each promise as soon as it became inconvenient. Gil Cisneros deceived us, just to get elected and puts his interests over ours. It's time that the people of the 39th District know the truth. Education in the Time of COVID-19 In the most recent installment in our town hall series, I was joined by Dr. Joanne Culverhouse from the La Habra City School District to discuss challenges that the district, students and parents are facing during COVID-19 as we start a new school year. Click here to watch the full town hall! Giving Back I was honored to partner with the DK Foundation to donate soaps to the Korean American Federation of Orange County who is providing care packages to students and seniors in need. Thank you for what you are doing to support our community during these times. Get Involved! Polling has shown that our race is a dead heat and one of the most competitive in the nation.

Team Young is doing all we can to make sure people know our message of fighting for the 39th District! Here is the latest update from our campaign: In Case You Missed It: I am honored to receive the Orange County Register endorsement. I am committed to fighting for what's right for our community. See what the OC Register had to say: "[[URL REDACTED]] Kim’s more persuasive stance on fiscal responsibility, coupled with her pro-trade and pro-immigration stances and willingness to set aside partisan interests in pursuit of bipartisanship is much closer to our views. On balance, we think Young Kim will be a sensible representative for the district who will stick up for taxpayers and cross the aisle when it’s the right thing to do."

Alex, Yesterday was a historic day. The House impeached a president for the third time in the history of our nation. But here in the Texas 10th, instead of standing up to the President’s abuse of power, Rep. McCaul abandoned all dignity and common sense. He said, “some 63 million Americans voted for President Trump,” and therefore he should not be impeached. Complete nonsense. McCaul has failed to uphold his oath of office. He claims to be a foreign policy expert — then he must know how important foreign aid is. He knows that when Congress appropriates aid and the President withholds it to advance his personal agenda — that is an abuse of power. Michael McCaul swore an oath to defend our constitution but he has done nothing but protect his own political ambitions. While McCaul has been sucking up to Trump, our district is in need. Tens of thousands without health care and closing rural hospitals. Several counties with polluted groundwater due to coal ash contamination and fracking fluids. Closing public schools and a growing homeless population. What has McCaul done with his time in office for the people of Texas 10? Nothing. I am committed to fighting for the people of this district. To ensure their needs are put first. And to fight to protect democracy in the United States, from all threats, foreign and domestic.

I know things are moving very quickly in the news, but the basic steps you need to be taking to stay healthy and safe have not changed. As a physician and Congressman, your health and safety is my number one priority. First, this is not the time for panic. I recommend the same, basic steps you’ve been hearing for a few weeks now: * If you’re over 65 or have underlying health issues, stay home. * Wash your hands. * Avoid gatherings of 10 or more people. * Stay home if you’re sick. * Open your windows and let in some fresh Kansas air when you can. * Use common sense. * Consult your physician if you feel ill. Second, President Trump and Vice President Pence have laid out a solid plan. Last week, phase one of the plan was passed. This plan funds the efforts underway right now to provide health resources to communities across our country. Now, the U.S. House has passed phase two and the Senate is working through it. I voted for this plan last week. It does several critical things: * Provides free COVID-19 testing. * Provides financial relief to those dealing with this illness through a tax credit, not a new entitlement. * Ensures the Social Security Administration is not running a paid leave program, protecting both seniors and those with debilitating conditions. I recently joined KSN for an in-depth conversation about my perspective on COVID-19 as a physician, the resources being activated to #StopTheSpread, and what you can do in your day-to-day lives to keep yourself and those around you healthy. If you have a second, I hope you’ll watch the full interview here. I’m going to continue doing everything I can to keep you informed as this public health emergency continues to unfold. Just as America has done throughout our history, we will overcome this. Stay healthy and God Bless, Dr. Roger Marshall Doc is running a campaign for Kansans, powered by Kansans. He's defending life. He's standing for our jobs, our families, and our faith. He's going to take our Kansas values to the U.S. Senate, but he can't get there without your help.

Doc just joined Dana Perino on Fox News, where he gave an update and his medical perspective on the coronavirus. Watch the full interview here. Like Doc says, this is not a time to panic and we must not be distracted by the noise. * Wash your hands. * Stay home if you’re sick. * Use common sense. Act like you would when you hear a snowstorm is coming. You don't panic - you stock up on what you might need, you make a plan for your loved ones, and you stay home as much as possible. President Trump, his team, and experts around the country have been preparing for this moment. Doc is closely following the situation and is working to keep Kansans and Americans safe.

This is just plain common sense. This is just plain common sense. In the United States, all people should be equal under the law and not have to worry about discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or anything else. We’re so happy that the Supreme Court has made workplace discrimination against LGBTQ+ Americans unlawful, but we know that our work is not done. Will you sign on before midnight to support the Equality Act and demand that the Senate passes it? Thanks, All of us at Cunningham HQ Begin Original Message: logo Big news, team. With the Supreme Court’s ruling this week to protect LGBTQ+ Americans from workplace discrimination, we won a huge victory in the fight towards equality. But to be clear, while this is a great win during Pride Month, our work is not over. It’s been over a year since the Equality Act passed the House, and the Senate has taken no moves to vote on it. That’s why I’m reaching out today to ask you to be one of the 10,000 people I need to sign on and demand equality for all Americans under the law. SIGN ON While we all celebrate this decision by the Supreme Court, the Department of Health and Human Services recently rolled back anti discrimination protections for trans Americans in healthcare and health insurance. It’s clear that the fight for full equality under the law isn’t over – that’s why we urgently need to pass the Equality Act and keep up the fight. Sign on to support LGBTQ+ equality now → [[URL REDACTED]] Thanks, Joe These are trying times for our country. We hope everyone is staying safe during the COVID-19 pandemic and following the guidance of our health officials. Our team is taking precautions and practicing social distancing by working remotely – we encourage everyone able to do the same. Out of an abundance of caution, we’ve canceled all in-person fundraising and campaign events, making our grassroots online outreach and fundraising all the more critical to running our campaign. Joe will continue working to protect our community and ensure every family has the resources needed to stay safe and healthy. From the entire team, we hope you stay with us in this important fight.

The Suncoast News Network just covered the broken promises Vern Buchanan has made to our seniors. It’s a hard-hitting story, and one that Vern cannot dispute. Vern said he would stand with our seniors, but instead he voted to cut Medicare 6 times. SIX TIMES.

Today’s the day! Friend, Today’s the day! Vote by Mail ballots are officially being mailed to voters’ mailboxes — and that means we have to push even harder. Vern Buchanan and the special interests backing him are spending heavily and launching attacks against Margaret, hoping they can use their negative attacks to win this election. But we know that won’t work. We believe in a new kind of campaign: a campaign built up from the grassroots, that focuses on what we can achieve together, not what keeps us apart. Voters are getting ready to cast their ballots now, so we need to be able to fight back against these attacks and get our message out. We’re just $3,021 away from hitting our goal.

Friend, I’m humbled by the support you’ve shown me over the past few months. Thanks to supporters here on the Suncoast, across Florida, and around the country — we raised more than $1.1 million for the fundraising quarter, which is more than double what our campaign has raised in any previous quarter! What makes this big news even more impressive is that I haven’t taken a single dollar from corporate PACs — it’s all thanks to people like you who contributed what they could to help me flip this seat from red to blue. Vern Buchanan is so concerned about our campaign’s fundraising progress, not only is he taking tons of money from corporate PACS, he has been forced to loan his campaign money repeatedly — and with less than a month until Election Day he will undoubtedly try to prop up his lagging campaign with his own money again. That’s where you come in, friend. Can you contribute for the first time right now to help keep our momentum growing and provide our campaign with the resources we need to fight back against Vern’s corporate backers and his personal loans to his campaign? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Donate $5 Now » Donate $10 Now » Donate $25 Now » Donate $50 Now » Donate $75 Now » Donate another amount. I’m running for Congress to deliver the change that the people of the Suncoast deserve. While Vern voted to defund Medicare six times and privatize Social Security, I will work to protect those vital programs, strengthen our economy, solve our water quality issues, lower health care costs, and deliver accountability to Washington. We can flip this district from red to blue and show Vern what real leadership looks like, but it’s going to take all of us, working together.

I know we’ve sent you a lot of emails over the last several days, but we wouldn’t be sending them to you if it wasn’t important. Before I explain what’s at stake in this election, can you rush your first contribution to our campaign to help us reach our critical fundraising goal before our midnight deadline? Friend, I know we’ve sent you a lot of emails over the last several days, but we wouldn’t be sending them to you if it wasn’t important. Before I explain what’s at stake in this election, can you rush your first contribution to our campaign to help us reach our critical fundraising goal before our midnight deadline? Click here to help us reach our $20,000 fundraising goal before midnight, we’re only $1,750 away! From ensuring the interests of actual people are put ahead of the interests of corporations, to restoring accountability to Washington, protecting our environment, and ensuring that everyone has access to the health care they need — the stakes couldn’t be higher in this election. The bottom line is that Vern Buchanan embodies all that is wrong with Washington, and as one of the most corrupt members of Congress, it’s past time we made a change. We can flip this seat from red to blue, I’ve done it before and I can do it again. But in order to do that we need the resources to fight back against the massive sums of money he’s taking from corporate PACs. While Vern has taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from corporate special interests, I refuse to take corporate PAC money, because I believe in representing the people, not corporations. Our government shouldn’t be for sale to the highest bidder, and this is your opportunity to show that a campaign powered by the people is more powerful than their campaign that’s funded by corporations. Please, click here to contribute any amount you can afford before our midnight fundraising deadline, so we can show Vern and his corporate allies that we have the support we need to flip this seat. I’m so grateful for all that you do to support our campaign. Thank you.

Friend, I’ll get right to the point. While our campaign is gaining momentum by the day, Vern’s campaign is being lifted up by personal loans and corporate backers — and the amount of money at his disposal is concerning. He has raised more than $3 MILLION so far in this election that he is spending against me in the final weeks of this campaign. We have broken records with our fundraising and the money we raise is being spent to communicate with voters — which is expensive. That is why I am writing to you today — and I’ll be blunt: in order to stay on TV this week, we need to raise $25,000 before Friday. Please, can you help us close this spending gap by contributing right now to help us keep our ads up on television next week?

The Trump administration’s efforts to undermine one of America’s most respected public servants, Dr. Anthony Fauci, is uncalled for and dangerous.

Friend, The Trump administration’s efforts to undermine one of America’s most respected public servants, Dr. Anthony Fauci, is uncalled for and dangerous. Dr. Fauci has stood up to the administration and put the American people first despite the repeated criticisms from President Trump and members of his administration. He is speaking out to ensure we hear the truth about the coronavirus and letting us know what we should be doing to limit its spread. In other words, he’s doing his job. We can’t let the Trump administration destroy Dr. Fauci’s reputation in the midst of this crisis when the American people need trusted advice. Please, add your name today to say you stand with Dr. Fauci in the face of these outrageous attacks by the Trump administration. This pandemic is not a game: it’s a clear threat to our health, our economy, and the world. Now more than ever, we need to listen to public health officials like Dr. Fauci. The last thing that should be happening is the disparagement of medical experts that are working to protect us from this devastating virus. Everyone should be following Dr. Fauci’s directives. We can’t afford to have anyone mistrust what he is advising the American people to do to protect themselves. We need to trust our medical experts and put science above all else during this difficult time. Can you add your name right now to show Dr. Fauci that you have his back as he faces attacks from the Trump administration?

From access to affordable health care and protecting the environment, to delivering accountability to Washington — we need Margaret fighting for us.

Friend, We have a big fundraising deadline on Wednesday at midnight and I want to take a few minutes to explain why this deadline is so important. Our final Federal Elections Commission quarterly report is due at the end of the month, and we can’t afford to fall short of our $30,000 goal. This deadline is important for the campaign: We have built a budget that allows us to communicate with voters across the district. If we don’t meet our goals, we can’t communicate. It’s that simple. But, I also know that we WILL meet our goals, because we have thousands of supporters who are as determined as I am to create the change we deserve. This deadline is also important to show strength: Vern Buchanan’s campaign team and the media will be combing over our report looking for any signs of weakness and we must show that we continue to run a campaign that is powered by us, the people, not corporate special interests. We are gaining momentum every day, but we have to keep pushing. This isn’t a race for the faint of heart -- we are fighting every single day for every single vote and we need you there with us. We are still $14,735 short of our goal, and need you to rush a contribution right now to help us close the gap before our last FEC end-of-quarter deadline of the election.

As promised, we're writing back with the results of the survey we did earlier this month. Margaret knows one of the most critical parts of being a successful legislator is the ability to step back and listen to the people she serves: her constituents and her community—and then to be accountable to them on the issues that matter. Team, As promised, we're writing back with the results of the survey we did earlier this month. Margaret knows one of the most critical parts of being a successful legislator is the ability to step back and listen to the people she serves: her constituents and her community—and then to be accountable to them on the issues that matter. The results from the feedback were emphatic and clear. The top three issues that Margaret's supporters care about are: 1. Healthcare 2. Clean water and clean air 3. Protecting Social Security and other social safety nets These were followed closely by curbing gun violence and making the economy work for everyone. These issues, as well as other issues you and your family care about, will continue to be the bedrock of Margaret's work when you send her to Washington to fight for us. We also wanted to share a few thoughts supporters shared with us: Nancy knows we have to keep working to bring people together: "Everything you listed is important to me. Bringing people together is critically important. The country's state of mind is too divisive. We need everyone to think about each other and not just 'me.' After that, everything can work." Brian and Anne-Marie both agree that climate change and our environment have to come first: "Climate change: the existential threat to the planet!" "I care about all of these issues (education, healthcare) but truly believe the most urgent is environmental. Plus, our entire state economy depends on tourism tied to our environment." Strengthening our safety net and infrastructure are of utmost importance to Steven: "I think we must strengthen our safety net programs at the state and local level given the depression we are currently experiencing. At the state level, the Republican legislature has paid little attention to infrastructure across government as the failures at Public Health and Labor so clearly demonstrate. The electorate needs to understand that these are the actions of a do-nothing Republican legislature." Cynthia Leigh believes we have to put access to affordable healthcare front and center: "I retired early and had to pay for health insurance on my own. With Medicare, the yearly premiums and deductibles for hospitalization, doctor visits, and drugs are less than $5,000 annually, or 70% less than before. Access to affordable health care should be available for all and not based on income or job." And finally, Robert advocates for vote-by-mail options for all: "I am a Disabled Vietnam Veteran with PTSD, and I did not vote for some 10 years after I returned home. It's still difficult to be a part of such crowds, and especially now with COVID, we need to have vote-by-mail options for everyone." We thank everyone who participated in this survey, and as we continue to focus on grassroots change and building this movement, we will work to center these issues in our campaign.

Friend, I am proud to support Margaret Good as she works to flip Florida’s 16th Congressional District from red to blue, and I’ll tell you why: Margaret is a fighter for Florida’s environmental future. Margaret understands that the decisions we make right now will impact our environment for years to come. In Congress, she will continue to stand up to special interests and polluters, and take real action on climate change. If we are going to keep control of the House of Representatives and enact a real agenda to protect our environment, we need Margaret’s voice. Can you join me in supporting her by chipping in to her campaign right now? Margaret has fought to improve our water quality, sponsored bold legislation to begin Florida’s transition to clean energy, and advocated for full funding of land preservation. Her opponent, Vern Buchanan, voted to roll back Clean Water Act protections, voted for the “Poison Our Waters Act,” and voted to allow oil drilling off our coasts. Margaret is the only real environmental champion in this race, and it shows. That is why Margaret Good has been endorsed by the League of Conservation Voters and received an “A” rating by the Sierra Club, while her opponent has one of the worst environmental records in Congress. We cannot afford to wait any longer to fight climate change, protect our environment, and create good, well-paying clean energy jobs. Please, join me in supporting Margaret’s campaign today. Together, we can flip this district blue, send Margaret to Congress, and work to protect our environment against polluters and special interests.

We’re in a tough spot, friend. These last few weeks of the campaign are the most critical time to spread our message to voters but we’re in one of the most expensive media markets in the country. We know Vern will continue to bail out his campaign by loaning it money and Corporate PACs will bankroll the rest. We’re running low on resources and are in danger of being drowned out by negative ads. We knew that it would be an uphill battle in this election, but we also know that we have a real chance to win this election because we can count on our grassroots supporters like you to step up when we need you most. Now is that time. We need to raise $25,000 by Friday to keep our television ads on the air in the upcoming week. Since yesterday, we have received an outpouring of support, but we still have a long way to go.

You’re getting this email because you’re interested in electing leaders who will listen to people, work hard, and do the right thing; even when it means working with those you don’t always agree with. Margaret Good is running for Congress because she knows we must end the partisan politics that hurt working families and do what’s right for a change. Margaret will bring the same work ethic and common sense leadership to Congress that has guided her as a non-profit leader, attorney, and legislator in order to make government work for Florida’s 16th district. Margaret is counting on supporters like you to help her keep up the fight and flip Florida’s 16th blue. But, if you’re not interested in joining our effort, you can unsubscribe at any time. * * * Friend, My name is Margaret Good and I’m running for Congress in Florida’s 16th district. At a time when divisive and hostile rhetoric is flooding our political discourse, it’s more important than ever to rise above the partisan bickering and tackle real issues that impact real Americans. Growing up as the daughter of an Episcopal priest and a nurse, I learned from a young age the importance of helping those around us and lending a hand when our neighbors are struggling. It’s why I made a career out of public service. And when a seat in the Florida Legislature opened up last year, I knew it was an opportunity to make a real difference in our community. What happened next was incredible: We united thousands of people across Southwest Florida and built a coalition strong enough to win a special election in a deep-red district. Now, it’s time to come together again, put aside our differences, and fight for our common goals and for the common good. We’re going to do this, but not without you. I need you to join me. For more than a decade, Congressman Buchanan has neglected Southwest Florida values and pushed our priorities aside to cater to the interests of Washington insiders. As our challenges have grown deeper and more complex, he continues to turn a blind eye to constituents and their needs by taking the easy way out. I’m running because the people of Florida’s 16th District deserve more than partisanship and political games. I’m running because we need to support our veterans, protect our environment, provide quality education to our young people, and make sure that people don’t go broke getting the healthcare they need. I’ll never stop fighting for our collective future -- and that means reaching across the aisle and finding solutions that cross the partisan divide. Congress can do so much more with our resources, and we deserve so much better than our current representative. That’s why I’m running, and why I’m so glad to have you with us in this fight. Thanks for joining our team, \-- Margaret Good To be removed from this email list, please unsubscribe . PAID FOR AND AUTHORIZED BY MARGARET GOOD FOR CONGRESS P.O. Box 5073 Sarasota, FL 34277

So many of us take this day to remember lost loved ones. I honor my Uncle Hugh who died in Vietnam when he was twenty. He put serving his country in the army before his own future. I honor Hugh, but I also honor my mom, her siblings, and my grandparents who bore the loss knowing that Hugh left a legacy of selflessness, courage, and love of country.

Friend, We’ve already raised $25,000 online from grassroots supporters this month, which is a big deal. But in order to defeat Vern Buchanan and his corporate PAC-funded campaign, I’m asking if you can step up again before our August 31st deadline. We’ve set an ambitious new goal to raise another $25,000 over the next five days, and I’m counting on you to help us reach it.

I knew running for Congress would be hard work, but rewarding, however, I had no idea we would face these unprecedented times or that we would be re-writing the playbook on how to campaign in 2020. Hi there, I knew running for Congress would be hard work, but rewarding, however, I had no idea we would face these unprecedented times or that we would be re-writing the playbook on how to campaign in 2020. But, I knew that no matter what we faced, we would rise to the occasion. I was confident we would rise to the occasion because of our incredible supporters — like you — who step up time and again. Now, when we hold a Zoom event, have a deadline to meet, or simply need your support getting the word out about our campaign on social media, you all are there. Thank you. At midnight tonight, we’ll close the books on May and head into the most critical end-of-quarter deadline our campaign has faced. Finishing the month strong is critical to keeping up our momentum — can you make a contribution before midnight to ensure we enter June in the strongest position possible?

“Education Secretary Betsy DeVos plans to move ahead with a policy that would boost the share of coronavirus relief dollars to private school students by writing it into a new regulation.” -Morning Education Hi there, As a state representative, Margaret prioritized public school funding and vocally opposed and voted against the privatization of our public schools. Along with Americans across the country, she has been horrified by this Administration’s gutting of public education, and the latest decision from Betsy DeVos is no different. DeVos continues to favor private schools in the distribution of COVID-19 relief, further weakening our public schools that are already devastated by funding cuts and often rely on local funding to provide vital curriculum to students. We desperately need leadership in Washington who will fight for everyone’s right to quality education. If you believe that our students deserve better, add your name here. As a state representative, Margaret fought hard in Tallahassee for public schools at every turn. With your help when we send her to Washington, I know she’ll continue to do just that.

Last night, we lost a hero. Friend, Last night, we lost a hero. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a hero for women’s rights, a hero for civil rights, and a hero for our shared values. Not only was she a hero to so many, she was an inspiration to me, personally. She inspired me to study law, to speak out when I see injustice, and to fight for the things I care about. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg devoted her life to promoting equal rights under the law, from her days as a young attorney who burned the midnight oil as the architect for the legal fight for women’s equality, to her time on the Supreme Court — she stood up for all of us and our rights. Many of the rights she stood up for, we take for granted today, like the right for women to serve on juries, and the right to get a mortgage without your husband’s signature — it was not that long ago we were still fighting for basic rights like these. She meant a lot to so many of us and to our democracy — we trusted her to defend our liberty and freedoms, and she will be so missed. As she said: “Fight for the things you care about, but do it in a way that leads others to join you.” She has taught us how to fight, now, it’s up to us. Together, we can defend her life’s work by using our voice and our vote — and we must, because there’s so much at stake. I hope you’ll join me in honoring her life’s work and doing your part to carry on her legacy.

"Vern Buchanan’s car dealerships received up to $7 million in federal coronavirus aid." -Tampa Bay Times "Vern Buchanan’s car dealerships received up to $7 million in federal coronavirus aid." -Tampa Bay Times This is outrageous and unacceptable. Despite being the 4th richest person in Congress, Vern still took as much as $7 million in PPP money, a program intended to help small businesses keep people on their payroll during the coronavirus pandemic. The hypocrisy shown by Vern in his actions is astounding. With one hand he shuts the door on communities asking for his help as he reaches the other into taxpayer's pockets to line his own. And the only way to change that is to vote him out in November, but we need resources to make that happen. Will you rush a contribution today so we have what we need to flip this seat blue in November?

I’ll get right to the point. Friend, I’ll get right to the point. In less than a week, Vote by Mail ballots will be landing in mailboxes here on the Suncoast, which means voting in this election will begin in just a matter of days. This is a big deal, friend. Next week, voters will have the opportunity to cast their ballots in this race and we must reach out to these voters before they cast their vote. That’s going to take a significant amount of resources and that’s why I’m reaching out to you right now. We’ve set a new online fundraising goal to raise $20,000 over the next week, so as soon as voters receive their ballots, we have the resources we need to reach them on TV, through the mail, and online. If we don’t reach this goal, we won’t have the resources we need to ensure that we are able to communicate with the voters we need to reach. Can you rush an urgent contribution right now to help us reach our fundraising goal, so we can contact voters who will be receiving their ballots next week? Your contribution will go directly towards funding our critical outreach efforts as voters begin voting by mail in this election.

Our path to victory may not be easy, but it is clear: Hi there, Our path to victory may not be easy, but it is clear: 1. Get a strong candidate with a record of getting things done for Floridians (have I mentioned how proud I am to work for Margaret?) 2. Organize everywhere in-district (including online!) to ensure people know about Margaret’s record of accomplishment 3. Build a community of grassroots supporters who can fight back against the national GOP dark money groups who don’t want Margaret to win this seat (we’re so glad you’re a part of this!) But in order to implement this path, we need resources. Can you become a sustaining member and make a recurring contribution through the election to ensure we have the resources we need to flip this seat from red to blue? Your contribution will go towards executing our plan and building on our strong foundation. And recurring contributions mean we can make bigger, bolder plans now and as we get closer to election day.

Friend, Every time we come up against a major deadline, I’ve counted on the support of our grassroots movement -- and each time, you push us across the finish line. Now, this race is statistically tied and we need your help. This has been a big week: we got back polling results showing us neck and neck; I appeared on Morning Joe to talk about the importance of flipping this district to ensure the integrity of the election; and we found out our grassroots organization outraised one of the wealthiest members of Congress 3 to 1 last quarter! But, Vern Buchanan has more cash in the bank than us and his corporate backers know we are coming for him. They are launching attack after attack against us, and we need your help if we are going to have the resources to continue to fight back and flip this seat from red to blue. Tonight is the last chance to have your donation matched to give your contribution double the impact. Please, before midnight, contribute what you can at this secured link and have your contribution automatically doubled: [[URL REDACTED]] I got into this race knowing it was going to be a tough fight, but I am running because I believe with every fiber of who I am that we deserve more from our government -- that we deserve leaders that actually work for the people they serve. I see the issues in my community: the seniors that are struggling with isolation and also worried to leave their homes for fear of coronavirus; the workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and are struggling; the parents who are worried about how this pandemic will shape their children. We need leaders who will do the work to get people back to work; who will follow science and the experts to get this virus under control; and who will work to make sure that the issues of our community are addressed. We have come so far in this race. We are so close to making this vision of better representation a reality, but these last several weeks are key.

Friend — Did you see my email this morning? I went on Morning Joe to talk about the opportunity we have to flip this district from red to blue, deliver accountability to Washington, and act as a check on Trump contesting a legitimate election.

Thanks so much, Margaret \---Forwarded Message--- Hi Friend, As the president of EMILY’s List, I couldn’t be more excited to reach out to you about the opportunity to flip a seat in Southwest Florida. Given her record, we already know that Margaret will be a strong voice for every community in Florida’s 16th District. And she will bring the same leadership to Congress that has guided her community work prior to serving in public office. Margaret’s strong record of running — and winning — means that she is ready to step up and take on an entrenched Republican incumbent with a record of hurting the communities he purports to represent. In just 48 hours, Margaret’s facing the toughest public filing deadline yet of her campaign. Can you donate $15 or more to her campaign today to make sure she finishes this quarter in the strongest position possible? Republicans are doing everything they can to win, and with all eyes on Florida, we have to make sure Margaret knows we’re on her side. Vice President Pence has already paid a visit to the District — so we know the GOP is worried. In 2018, EMILY’s List helped a record-breaking number of women get elected to Congress — and with your help, we can keep building on that success. Please, make a contribution today to ensure Margaret has what it takes to win.

Multi-millionaire Vern Buchanan has no business taking out a loan meant for hard working small business owners who have been impacted by the pandemic -- the loans were meant to save jobs, not pad Vern’s pockets. Friend, While Margaret Good does what she says she will do, you can’t say the same for her opponent, Vern Buchanan. Whether it’s protecting Social Security and Medicare, lowering drug prices, or protecting our environment, Vern Buchanan says one thing and does the opposite. Almost FOURTEEN years ago, Vern even advocated for TWELVE year term limits for members of Congress. Guess what? He’s overstayed his welcome. He knows it and we do, too. We know Vern doesn’t keep his promises, but now you can help us force him to stay true to his word by helping us defeat him in this election.

I’ll get right to the point. Friend, I’ll get right to the point. In order to fully fund our Get Out The Vote efforts in the final days of this campaign, we need to raise another $13,750 to reach our $25,000 goal -- and I’m counting on grassroots supporters like you to help us reach it. This race could be decided by just a handful of votes, which is why we have to do everything we can to turn out as many voters as possible between now and Tuesday. If we turn out enough voters to flip this seat from red to blue, we can also help Joe Biden win in Florida -- the biggest battleground state in the entire country. Despite the high turnout so far here on the Suncoast, there’s still a lot of people who could help us win this election who have yet to vote. That’s where you come in, friend. Can you help provide the resources we need to fully fund our Get Out The Vote effort that can turn out the vote in record numbers, flip this seat from red to blue, and help deliver Florida for Joe Biden?

Did you see Margaret’s message? We have a real chance to flip this seat, protect control of Congress, and ensure the people of the Suncoast are represented by someone who is going to fight for them — not corporate special interests. Friend — Did you see Margaret’s message? We have a real chance to flip this seat, protect control of Congress, and ensure the people of the Suncoast are represented by someone who is going to fight for them — not corporate special interests. But to do that we need to raise the resources necessary to counter the attacks Vern Buchanan will throw at us and get our message out to voters. Margaret refuses to take money from corporate PACs, because she believes in you and wants to represent you. But that also means we’re relying on grassroots supporters like you to power our campaign, which is why we are asking for your help right now before our end-of-month fundraising deadline. Please, click on this secure link right now to contribute what you can to help us defeat one of the most corrupt members of Congress and help flip this seat from red to blue: [[URL REDACTED]] I look forward to telling Margaret that you are in this race with us and supporting her at every opportunity. Shayne Cheshire Finance Director Margaret Good for Congress \---------- Forwarded message --------- From: Margaret Good Date: Mon, Jul 27, 2020 at 4:35 PM Subject: we can flip this seat Friend, I’m writing to you today, because we are quickly approaching our critical end-of-month fundraising deadline and I need your help. We’ve set a fundraising goal to raise $20,000 online before the end of the month and we are still $12,500 away from reaching this must-hit goal before our Friday deadline. It may seem like a long way to go, but if I can count on supporters like you to contribute whatever amount you can afford right now, we can reach this critical goal — together. We have a tough race ahead of us, and we have a very real chance to flip this seat and finally deliver proper representation in Congress to the people of the Suncoast. But in order for us to flip this seat from red to blue, it’s going to take a lot of resources to fight back against the attacks headed my way. We simply can’t afford to have Vern Buchanan continue to represent us in Congress, just like we can’t afford to miss this fundraising goal before our end-of-month deadline. Can you make a contribution right now to help me flip this seat blue, so I can work towards delivering a brighter future to the people of the Suncoast and our nation?

Team, Just 14 days stand between us and our public filing deadline. The amount we are able to raise between now and then will determine if we have the resources we need to flip this district. And what we report will be used by the GOP, the media, and the political pundits to gauge the strength of our campaign. So my team and I are asking everyone who receives this email to make a contribution today: Donate $15 » Donate $25 » Donate $50 or more » If everyone makes a contribution today, even if it’s a small one, it will make a huge difference and will help ensure we are able to flip this seat and bring progress to Florida's 16th District. Hitting our goal ensures that we’re where we need to be at the end of the quarter. We're up against GOP leadership that does not want to lose this seat and does not want to lose Florida—so we have to be ready to fight—and with your help, we will be. If you're able, please contribute today so that we have what we need as we near our public filing deadline in just 14 days. Thank you for your support.

We are so close! Friend, I just got word from our team: as we head into the final day of our big end-of-month fundraising push, we’re now just $6,923 away from reaching our goal! We are so close! With Vote by Mail ballots arriving in voters’ mailboxes soon, we don’t have a moment to waste. We need to get television ads on the air, send out mail, and get our digital ads up and running before voters begin casting their ballots and time is running out. Can you pitch in before midnight tonight to push us over the finish line and ensure we reach our end-of-month fundraising goal? It’s critical we reach this goal to fund our voter outreach efforts in the coming weeks. This campaign represents the people, not special interests. And together, we can protect Social Security, fund the Postal Service, and recover from this pandemic. But first, I need your help to flip this seat, so I can represent you and our shared values in Washington. Please, click here to rush a contribution of any amount you can afford before our midnight deadline. We can’t flip this seat blue, flip Florida blue, and win the White House without your help.

Hi friend, Five years ago the U.S. Supreme Court made marriage equality a reality for all Americans. It was a victory for the LGBTQ+ community, and a monumental step forward for justice and equality for all. Today, I'm overjoyed to invite you to our June 30th event themed around LGBTQ+ rights. The digital fundraiser will include special appearances from activists in the fight for equality, including Equality Florida Executive Director Nadine Smith, author and communications specialist Elizabeth Hines, and Roberta Kaplan, who represented Edie Windsor in the Supreme Court case that overturned the Defense of Marriage Act.

As Margaret’s campaign manager, it’s my job to make sure every single part of our campaign is running smoothly, and to do that I need to make sure we have the resources we need from month to month. That’s why we have these monthly fundraising deadlines, so we can stay on track to raise the resources we need to continue building out the campaign and ensure we have the resources to take on Vern Buchanan and win. Friend, As Margaret’s campaign manager, it’s my job to make sure every single part of our campaign is running smoothly, and to do that I need to make sure we have the resources we need from month to month. That’s why we have these monthly fundraising deadlines, so we can stay on track to raise the resources we need to continue building out the campaign and ensure we have the resources to take on Vern Buchanan and win. The bottom line is that in order to defeat Vern, we’re going to need money, and lots of it. Vern has already taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from corporate PACs and there’s no telling how much money he’s going to loan his campaign from his personal fortune. We can’t let Vern and his corporate donors buy this election. So it’s up to grassroots supporters like you to help us reach our online fundraising goals month after month if we want to win this race and defeat Vern. We’re only $7,150 away from reaching the ambitious $20,000 online fundraising goal we’ve set for the month, and you can help us reach it by making a contribution before Friday’s deadline. Margaret is counting on you. If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Donate $5 Now » Donate $10 Now » Donate $25 Now » Donate $50 Now » Donate $75 Now » Donate another amount.

And we must also reflect and thank our brothers and sisters in the Labor Movement that brought us the 40-hour work week, the minimum wage, and critical protections for workers. I want to thank all the workers here on the Suncoast, across Florida, and our nation that help keep things running. Especially our essential workers and our first responders that are on the front lines during this pandemic, risking their health to keep our economy moving and helping people in need. Workers are the backbone of our economy, and should be treated with the respect they deserve. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case. That’s why I’m fighting to lift up workers and rebuild our economy from the ground up. I will always advocate on behalf of workers, and if you can help me win this election, I will bring their fight to Congress and I will work as hard as you work every day to ensure workers are protected and supported in every way possible. Thank you for supporting workers this Labor Day and everyday.

Friend, We’ve got big news: our race was featured in Newsweek! Why? Because our campaign may hold the key to securing Florida’s 29 electoral college votes and winning the White House. Our race is key to flipping Florida blue — one of the only races nationwide where we can work together to not only flip our congressional seat blue, but to flip the biggest battleground state in the nation, and set us all on the path to victory and bring accountability to Washington. We know that we are going to face a barrage of attacks from national groups as we get closer to the general election. That’s why Margaret is relying on you to help ensure we have the resources necessary to fight back. An investment in our campaign is an investment in flipping Florida blue, keeping control of the House of Representatives, and winning the White House.

"GOP Expects to Move its Convention to Jacksonville" -Washington Post, 6/10/2020 Friends, The Washington Post just announced that the Republican National Convention is likely to move its massive August event to Florida. It’s no coincidence that President Trump is eyeing the Sunshine State ⁠— his re-election and success are dependent on us and our historically razor-thin margin of victory. It’s no surprise Trump found a willing ally in Governor DeSantis as he was searching for someone willing to disregard CDC guidelines and put his own community at risk in order to host what amounts to a giant party. So, we want to know what you think of this potential move ⁠— should the GOP move their convention to Florida? YES NO Margaret has the chance to flip a seat that will allow the Democrats to take back Florida in November. We have to show them that we’re standing up for our communities and for our health. Thanks so much for your input ⁠— we’ll keep you posted as we hear more.

When I was a little girl, my mom would ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up. My answer was always the same: a professional baseball player, or President of the United States. Friend, When I was a little girl, my mom would ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up. My answer was always the same: a professional baseball player, or President of the United States. She inevitably would respond that, when she was growing up, she felt like she had only two choices: she could be either a teacher or a nurse. She became a nurse and spent her entire career helping people when they needed it most. My two aunts became teachers, devoting their lives to educating future generations. I will always be immensely proud of my family and their commitment to their communities and their careers, but hearing that from my mom -- that she felt her choices were so limited -- has always stayed with me, driven me, and inspired me throughout my life. My mom has made me determined to build a world where people do not feel that their opportunities are limited because of who they are. That is why I started out working in nonprofits like City Year and the United Way, and then, because I wanted more choices, I went to law school, and ran for office. My mom inspired me to build a better world for everyone, where our opportunities are not limited because of who we are. Where we all can pursue our dreams and our passions. Together, we have an opportunity to flip this congressional seat blue and create real change. Will you join me and my mom in working to build a better, fairer world, where our opportunities are limitless?

As a group hyper-focused on the most competitive districts in the country, we’re proud they’re a part of our movement. Friends, I’m reaching out with some exciting news: our campaign just received another endorsement — this time from the Progressive Turnout Project. As a group hyper-focused on the most competitive districts in the country, we’re proud they’re a part of our movement. It’s going to take a lot of work to flip this seat from red to blue and send Margaret to Congress. And while our latest endorsement is great news — we’re quickly approaching our end of month deadline, and we’re a bit short of our $15,000 online fundraising goal. One of the best ways to support the campaign and help us stay competitive is to become a sustaining member by pledging a monthly contribution of $25 to ensure Margaret has the resources she needs to win.

I've been speaking with constituents from across our district over the last few weeks and everyone seems to agree: we need big, bold ideas to save our economy, keep people healthy, and get our country on a path towards recovery. Here are the facts: * Upwards of 90,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus, a number destined to rise with more than 1.5 million confirmed cases. * 133 million initial unemployment claims in the past seven weeks, with the April jobs report showing the highest national unemployment rate since the Great Depression. We need action, now. Last week, I brought bold, urgently-needed legislation to continue responding to the coronavirus crisis to the House floor – all grounded in common sense: 1. Reopening in a safe, responsible way. That means a science-based path to safely reopen the country with tens of billions for testing, tracing, and treatment. We need a clear strategy of testing, tracing, and treatment. 2. Immediate action to help families who are experiencing food insecurity. Food pantries have seen a substantial increase in people in need – many families for the first time ever. While nonprofits are doing an amazing job, they are struggling to keep up with demand. We need to: * boost SNAP maximum benefits by 15 percent, increase the minimum monthly benefits from $16 to $30. * suspend the Trump Administration's rules that undermine benefits. * enact Chef Jose Andres' idea last week to help increase federal support to cities and states for buying food and paying restaurants to cook it for vulnerable families. 3. Honor our heroes by providing nearly $1 trillion to state and local governments. Government agencies need to pay first responders, health workers, and teachers who keep us safe and are in danger of losing their jobs during this public health emergency. 4. A second round of expanded economic impact payments, vastly strengthened Unemployment Insurance, new payroll protection measures. We need to get funds into the hands of our states, counties, cities, communities, families, and individuals before their bank accounts run dry. That means keeping workers connected to jobs and paychecks, providing critical fixes to bolster the Paycheck Protection Program, and other truly life-or-death protections for health security, workplace security, housing security, and food security. I don't know what Mitch McConnell or President Trump will do – but they should get this bill signed into law in a bipartisan way.

The question is, what are we going to do about it? Things are bad, and getting worse. The question is, what are we going to do about it? My view is that, in order to make it better in the long term, we have to win elections. Put people in office who believe in science, follow the facts, and do what is right, regardless of the politics. That’s why I’m hosting a phone bank this next Thursday, July 16th, where we will reach out to hundreds of thousands of Texas Democrats. The results from these calls will be shared with the Texas Democratic Party as well as Democratic candidates up and down the ballot (courthouse to state house to White House) to use for Get Out the Vote efforts in the fall. In the midst of this pandemic, unable to knock on doors, hold rallies and town halls, and totally dependent on phone-to-phone field work, Texas Democratic candidates will be able to leverage our work to contact their voters. They won’t have to waste time calling bad numbers or Trump supporters, because our volunteers will have made the millions of calls necessary to cull extraneous numbers and return a verified, usable list of Texas Democrats that we can turn out during early voting and on Election Day. That’s why we’re doing this work now, to win these elections in November. We don’t want to look back on this day from election night wondering whether we could have done more. Let’s do everything we can now. As if we needed any additional clarity on the stakes of this election, yesterday we learned that Texas had reached a new record for Covid-19 deaths and hospitalizations, and that the United States recorded its highest single-day spike in new cases. In Corpus Christi, they’ve run out of room in the morgue and they’re requesting morgue trailers from FEMA. In the Rio Grande Valley they’ve run out of nurses. El Paso, Dallas, San Antonio, Austin and Houston are all seeing record spikes in transmission, hospitalizations and death. These are the consequences of past elections. America elected a President who is contemptuous of public health guidance. The man in the most powerful position of public trust ignores the scientists and doctors whose advice might have kept us safe. He instead chooses to traffic in lies, create chaos and confusion, leaving us the country hardest hit by the virus. Americans represent 4% of the global population but we are now 25% of the world’s cases and deaths. Texas elected a Governor who, in the words of the Houston Chronicle, chooses to “embrace partisan politics and a fringe populist backlash over common sense and sound medical advice from his own advisers.” Governor Abbott has “condemned the Lone Star State to the circumstances we face today: Hospitals near the breaking point. Nearly 3,000 Texans dead — and counting.” But if it is the elections of these men that left us in such desperate straights, it’s the elections in November that can begin to make things right. Electing a Democratic majority to the state house for the first time in 20 years puts people who believe in science, in expanding access to healthcare, in addressing the disproportionate burden that Black and Latino Texans carry in this crisis into power. And awarding our 38 electoral college votes to the Democratic nominee for President for the first time in over forty years spells the end of Trump and the beginning of something much better. But the only way to make these changes, the only way to win these elections, is through the hard work of contacting the voters who will decide them. That’s what we do and we’d love to have your help doing it. Please join us: Virtual Voter Contact Phone Bank with Beto Thursday, July 16 7 p.m. - 9 p.m. CT RSVP now Thank you, Beto This is a picture from last Monday’s phone bank, where we made over 316,000 phone calls.

Given the level of gun violence in this country, it’s critical that we hold our elected representatives accountable for what they’ve done or failed to do when it comes to gun safety legislation. # Powered By People Texas is in the midst of a gun violence crisis. More than 3,500 people died in firearm deaths in 2017. Despite efforts from democrats in the state Legislature — and even though most Texans agree that this is an urgent problem that must be fixed — common sense measures like universal background checks are repeatedly stonewalled. To counter this, we put together a resource to track how our elected officials voted on gun violence legislation in the 2019 session: How to hold Texas legislators responsible Please take a moment to read Beto’s Medium post detailing this new resource and the severity of this gun violence epidemic.

Alex, The coronavirus pandemic is exposing chronic shortcomings in eldercare in the United States — especially with regard to nursing homes — and as our population ages they will only become worse. That warning was shared with us by Cornell gerontologist Karl Pillemer at this past week's Tuesdays Talk with Tracy. "COVID-19 is a disease to which all of us are vulnerable," Pillemer said, but it's "a disease primarily of the older population." Although children are among the fatalities, only two percent of all COVID-19 deaths in New York State were people under 40 years old, and almost none were people under 21. "This disease tracks age structure almost exactly," Pillemer said. "People 80 years old and over with multiple health conditions are five to 20 times more likely to die if infected. They account for 80 percent of the COVID-19 deaths in the 65-and-older age group in New York, and it's even higher in some countries." As the elderly are disproportionately represented in coronavirus infection and death statistics, nursing homes are emerging as the type of environment where it spreads fastest. "It's a disease of other 'trapped' populations — people in group homes, in prisons, areas where people are brought close together. But it has wrought havoc in nursing homes all over the world," said Pillemer. "Almost all states report at least 30 percent of their COVID-19 deaths have occurred in care homes for older people. In five states, it's almost 80 percent. Yet, less than one percent of the adult population lives in nursing homes." Pillemer called on local and state officials to make nursing homes a pandemic priority, facilitating frequent testing, adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies and financial incentives for staff — who are often lower-income workers living in densely populated neighborhoods — to stay home if they're sick. "Policymakers have to be clear about their commitment to this group. Not just for humanitarian reasons; it will also improve their ability to reopen a whole state." Counties in Pennsylvania can't reopen because of the number of cases, said Pillemer, but they "could be contained in one or two nursing homes." And Alex, I wholeheartedly agree. We must do a better job supporting our nursing home staffs by making it easier for them to comply with increased testing requirements and other rule changes. Unfortunately, the very real issues with our health care system have become so politicized, it's hard to talk sensibly about it. But it's long past due that we shift from partisan talking points to addressing the real problem. In my countless trips around our district, it's clear our communities would greatly benefit by ending the ability to deny coverage due to pre-exisiting conditions; ensuring generic pricing options for common medications such as insulin, epi-pens, and inhalers; reducing the age of eligibility for Medicare; providing tuition forgiveness for medical education; and organizing local and regional care with major medical centers while expanding telemedicine options. But above all, we need to prioritize planning over profit. It is long-past time to set politics aside and discuss fixes to health and long-term care openly, civilly, and without hyperbole to come to common sense solutions.

Now is a time for good judgment and common sense Facebook Join My List Logo Dear Alex, The world is facing a pandemic with the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus. It has become a crisis in the United States, and New York has the largest outbreak of the virus in the country. Now is not a time for panic. It is a time for common sense and cooperation. President Trump has declared a national emergency which allows him to access more resources and brings the full strength of the federal government to address the spread, treatment and impact of the virus. He has also forged an unprecedented public-private partnership to aid the efforts. Testing will be expedited and prioritized. The search for treatment drugs is being fast-tracked. Our healthcare systems have the freedom to meet the needs in their communities. A search for a vaccine – though not imminent – is in sight. The power of American innovation will lead the way. I applaud Governor Cuomo for the decisive steps he has taken to contain the spread of the virus. Below is a link to the New York Department of Health’s page on the coronavirus. If you need answers to questions, call their hotline at 888-364-3065. NY Department of Health - Coronavirus Symptoms may appear between 2 and 14 days from exposure, with an average and median of 5 days. They include a fever, cough and shortness of breath. Below is a link to the Center for Disease Control’s site on the coronavirus. Center for Disease Control Coronavirus All of us play a key role in preventing the spread of this disease. We need to continue to use good judgment and common sense going forward. Now is a good time to travel less and stay home with loved ones. If you think you have been exposed or have symptoms, please self-quarantine and contact your doctor. I have decided to postpone all campaign events for the next few weeks as we deal with this evolving situation. I will seek other ways to communicate with voters across the Hudson Valley that include phone calls, tele-town halls and digital advertising. All campaigns are required to obtain signed petitions to get on the ballot. The shortened deadline for signatures is Tuesday, March 17th. So, volunteers will be out knocking doors over the next few days to obtain the required signatures in the safest manner possible. New Yorkers are resilient. We take care of each other.

Adrienne for Kansas * * * Alex, As we prepare for Kansas to reopen and get our lives back to normal, I want you to know that I am here for you. If you have questions on the process of reopening, need help navigating each phase of reopening our state, or are unable to find needed resources - please do not hesitate to reach out. The good news right now is that the statewide stay-at-home order will come to an end on Monday. Governor Kelly finally released her plan to reopen Kansas late this past Thursday. The governor should have been focused on creating a strategic plan that includes mitigating the spread of COVID-19, with a focus on protecting our most vulnerable, while reopening our economy. We must start getting people back to work - which ease the financial burden families are facing, allowing them to feed their families, and improve mental health. But she hasn't been, rather she continues to use this pandemic as an opportunity to undermine President Trump and put her self interest above the needs of Kansans. If you live in Kansas' Third Congressional District, Miami County will start the process of reopening on May 4th, while Johnson and Wyandotte counties have extended their stay-at-home order until May 10th. I am grateful that Miami county will be starting the process of opening, and disappointed in the lack of urgency and leadership Johnson and Wyandotte counties have shown to ensure we can open safely. Kansans are facing hardship and too many elected officials are dragging their feet rather than working on implementing a plan that safely reopens our economy. My biggest disappointment in having this plan put out so late is the lack of time and guidance that has been given to our small business owners. It is going to take time for the businesses who have been forced to close to put measures in place in order to open and ensure they are doing their part to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. I have been working with several local small businesses and working with county officials in our district in order to ensure that they are not just following orders, but going above and beyond to ensure their customers feel comfortable and safe. This week, I had the chance to visit one of the businesses I have been working with - and what I saw was a small business owner, who loves their business and serving their community. The time, effort, and thorough planning each business that I have had the opportunity to help amazes me. These businesses have put so much thought into creating an environment where their customers will feel safe, and allows them to open to the public. These small businesses owners truly show the work ethic and heart of all Kansans. We want what is best for each other, and we are willing to do what it takes to get that done. * * * Each county will be implementing Phase 1 of Governor Kelly’s plan starting when their stay-at-home order expires. Unfortunately the vast majority of businesses will still not be allowed to reopen once the stay-at-home order is lifted and they enter Phase 1. It’s clear that by her plan that she has very little trust in Kansans ability to abide by CDC guidelines and safe common sense practices that will allow us to get back to work and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. * * * But let's not fool ourselves, Governor Kelly is still abusing her power. Over the last month, she has proven herself to be an ineffective leader with her inability to provide essential services to Kansans. Rather than working harder and smarter or admitting her faults and asking for help, she has opted to blame the Trump Administration every chance she has had. And to top it off, the first opportunity she had to she completely dismissed our Constitutional rights in a power grab, when she could have effetely ensured the safety of Kansans with guidance rather than an Executive Order. Now as we begin to open our state again, she says she is not extending her stay-at-home Executive Order and leaving things up to the counties. But what she fails to mention is that she is only allowing the counties to put stricter guidelines in place, not to truly make their own decisions. * * * Topping all of this off, Governor Kelly does not believe that Kansas should enter Phase 4 of her plan until there is a vaccine available that has been tested and is widely available. Which could be up to 18 more months! * * * While the Governor is plotting more ways to continue to control Kansans, my opponent Sharice Davids is continuing to be Nancy Pelosi's puppet. Rather than helping small businesses during this time, Davids is wanting a list of small businesses who received loans - searching for another reason to blame President Trump. If she would be working on the behalf of Kansans and helping our small businesses, she would have realized by now that the hold up on businesses receiving the loans has not been the fault of the SBA. It has been caused by larger banks requesting unnecessary paperwork to be filled out and then holding their funds for as long as they are legally allowed to before dispersing them to the business. This has been an issue I have been working with businesses on, and one that is not seen in smaller local banks or credit unions. Most recently, Sharice Davids was endorsed by Warren Democrats - in their endorsement they they highlighted the work Davids has been doing to limit our Second Amendment rights. In fact, Davids herself has been touting her work with Moms Demand Action and BradyPAC. She has also recently be endorsed, yet again, by EMILY's List for her support of abortion. These are just a few highlights of why it is so important that we #TakeBackKS3 and flip the House. * * * Our grassroots team continues to grow, we have over 200 volunteers making thousands of phone calls each week! And we have over 1,500 individual small dollar donors! I may not be the candidate with the most money in the bank, but I am the candidate who has received the most money from those who believe in me, not the deep pocked swamp donors who can buy my vote when elected. If you would like to join our Grassroots Team, sign up here. * * * With less than 100 days left before the primary election, we are delivering yard signs to those who have requested them. If you would like one of my yard signs, reply to this email and I will make sure to get one to you this week. * * * Last October when I announced, no one could have possibly imagined the circumstances we find ourselves in today. Through prayer and courage, the strength of our American ingenuity will carry us through. Thank you for your support, because of you we are off to a great start and are ready to #TakeBackKS3!

It's time for Democrats to get serious View this email in your browser # NOW Is The Time To Lead! Defund the police? Disband police forces? Burn it all down? The radical left have lost their minds! At a moment of national consensus on the need for police reform, the well is being poisoned by the most fanatical and unreasonable voices in our society. Look at the examples of Seattle, where a police precinct is being occupied by anarchists, and Minneapolis, where a far left city council has voted to get rid of the police altogether. These things are scaring reasonable people to death. Instead of responding by seeking a bipartisan reform bill that meets the demands of the American people, Congressional Democrats seem beholden to this fringe and have passed legislation that reflects it. There are common sense reforms upon which most people can agree such as: ✅ banning chokeholds, ✅ balancing qualified immunity against grossly negligent police actions, ✅ limiting the power of unions to protect bad cops, and ✅ a national database so that abusive officers can't bounce from job to job. The majority of Republican and Democrat legislators, myself included, are ready to vote for these reforms. Unfortunately, Democrat House leadership locked out Republican members and instead passed a radical and recklessly ideological bill that has no hope of passage in the Senate. At the same time, Senate Democrats rebuffed Republican offers to include 20 amendments to the Senate GOP bill and refused to even debate the issue. This is not leadership. It is clear that the Democrats want an election issue more than they want reforms that will save lives and rebuild trust between the police and the communities they serve. This is a shame. Right now, we have a moment when bipartisan reform is possible. I am calling on my Democrat colleagues to put aside partisanship and come together to do what the American people elected us to do.

There is a battle being fought for the soul of our nation. This is a historic moment of division and divisiveness. How our country acts now will have lasting effects on the future. How we as people act matters. When the Democrats accused me of being a “token” for introducing legislation which would hold police accountable, make lynchings a federal crime, and ensure our police treat every man and woman with the respect that they deserve, they implied that I was a traitor to African Americans. Alex, There is a battle being fought for the soul of our nation. This is a historic moment of division and divisiveness. How our country acts now will have lasting effects on the future. How we as people act matters. When the Democrats accused me of being a “token” for introducing legislation which would support the good cops and weed out the bad cops and take common sense steps to rebuild lost trust between communities of color and law enforcement, they implied that I was a traitor to African Americans. Alex, I need your help to show the Democrats that caring about this country and ALL of the people who live here takes more than wearing a stereotypical scarf for a photoshoot. Can you chip in $15 to send a message that we don't have time to play politics? As a nation we need to unite. It is through hard times like these that we come out stronger. Can you help me ensure that we have a Republican majority to help us get there? Chip in $15 or more so that the Democrats hear our voices I have grown accustomed to the insults and attacks from the Democrats.

This election will come down to the very last donation. From the Desk of Senator Lindsey Graham Alex, Democrats are all-in to defeat us. They are dumping historic amounts of money – HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS – into red states in order to flip the Senate majority. Wow. There’s one thing I know: Senator Steve Daines and I will never stop fighting for you and our conservative values. But here’s the thing – we need your URGENT SUPPORT in order to fight the Left’s MASSIVE war chest. We’ve reviewed the numbers, and we’re still 234 donations short of hitting our midnight goal. Will you contribute $5 or $10 before 11:59 PM TONIGHT in order for us to protect our Republican Senate majority? DEFEND THE MAJORITY → This election will come down to the very last donation because every dollar you contribute will directly impact whether Senator Daines and I can fend off Obama and Schumer’s next multi-million dollar attack against us. We’re counting on your support. My opponent raised $57 million in the last three months – more than any Senate candidate in history, but I know with your contribution – of even just $5 or $10 – we can BEAT the Left, PROTECT our Senate majority, and SAVE the Supreme Court. PROTECT THE MAJORITY AND SAVE THE SUPREME COURT → Sincerely, Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham P.S. The contribution you make today will be split to help Steve Daines in Montana and my campaign in South Carolina. These races are our only chance at keeping the GOP Senate majority, so thank you for donating before it’s too late.

Our gun safety video chat tomorrow could not come at a more critical time. Alex -- I'm really looking forward to our gun safety video chat event tomorrow afternoon with Parkland Dad Fred Guttenberg and Moms Demand Action founder Shannon Watts. With this week's news, it could not come at a more critical time for gun violence in America. We'll be discussing where we go from here and more on tomorrow's virtual event at 2 PM EST. RSVP now to get in on the conversation » You're probably already following the Ahmaud Arbery shooting closely if you're in Georgia like many folks on this email list, but for those of you in other states, the story really started making headline news this week when an explicit video of the shooting of yet another unarmed black man was released by the national media. It brought immediate comparisons to 2012, with the killing of Travyvon Martin, and of my son Jordan Davis. Folks on a wide spectrum of political views have spoken out lamenting the killing this week. It's another inflection point, and our gun safety movement needs to be ready to act. Like in Jordan's case, we need the judicial system to do the right thing here and get justice for Ahmaud's family. But we can not let this kind of thing keep happening in America -- full stop. Unarmed black men can not keep being gunned down in their cars, at a gas station, because they wanted a bag of skittles and an Arizona iced tea, or while jogging in their neighborhood. Our kids must be able to attend school without the threat of being gunned down. So, I hope you'll join us for our gun safety video chat tomorrow at 2pm -- I'm eager to discuss how our gun safety movement goes forward from here to continue to make changes in Congress and across the country that work towards our goal of common sense solutions to end gun violence. Here's the best link to RSVP if you're interested in attending the virtual event at 2pm tomorrow: [[URL REDACTED]] See you there tomorrow afternoon! Fred, Shannon, and I are looking forward to it.

We’re in a tough spot, Alex. These last few weeks of the campaign are the most critical time to spread our message to voters but we’re in one of the most expensive media markets in the country. We know Vern will continue to bail out his campaign by loaning it money and Corporate PACs will bankroll the rest. We’re running low on resources and are in danger of being drowned out by negative ads. We knew that it would be an uphill battle in this election, but we also know that we have a real chance to win this election because we can count on our grassroots supporters like you to step up when we need you most. Now is that time. We need to raise $25,000 by Friday to keep our television ads on the air in the upcoming week. Since yesterday, we have received an outpouring of support, but we still have a long way to go. Alex, can we count on you to rush an urgent contribution right now to help Margaret flip this seat from red to blue? The stakes couldn’t be higher.

Did you see Margaret’s message? We have a real chance to flip this seat, protect control of Congress, and ensure the people of the Suncoast are represented by someone who is going to fight for them — not corporate special interests. Alex — Did you see Margaret’s message? We have a real chance to flip this seat, protect control of Congress, and ensure the people of the Suncoast are represented by someone who is going to fight for them — not corporate special interests. But to do that we need to raise the resources necessary to counter the attacks Vern Buchanan will throw at us and get our message out to voters. Margaret refuses to take money from corporate PACs, because she believes in you and wants to represent you. But that also means we’re relying on grassroots supporters like you to power our campaign, which is why we are asking for your help right now before our end-of-month fundraising deadline. Alex, click on this secure link right now to contribute what you can to help us defeat one of the most corrupt members of Congress and help flip this seat from red to blue: [[URL REDACTED]] I look forward to telling Margaret that you are in this race with us and supporting her at every opportunity.

We’ve set a fundraising goal to raise $20,000 online before the end of the month and we are still $12,500 away from reaching this must-hit goal before our Friday deadline. It may seem like a long way to go, but if I can count on supporters like you to contribute whatever amount you can afford right now, we can reach this critical goal — together. We have a tough race ahead of us, and we have a very real chance to flip this seat and finally deliver proper representation in Congress to the people of the Suncoast. But in order for us to flip this seat from red to blue, it’s going to take a lot of resources to fight back against the attacks headed my way. We simply can’t afford to have Vern Buchanan continue to represent us in Congress, just like we can’t afford to miss this fundraising goal before our end-of-month deadline.

Multi-millionaire Vern Buchanan has no business taking out a loan meant for hard working small business owners who have been impacted by the pandemic -- the loans were meant to save jobs, not pad Vern’s pockets.

Alex, While Margaret Good does what she says she will do, you can’t say the same for her opponent, Vern Buchanan. Whether it’s protecting Social Security and Medicare, lowering drug prices, or protecting our environment, Vern Buchanan says one thing and does the opposite.

That’s why we have these monthly fundraising deadlines, so we can stay on track to raise the resources we need to continue building out the campaign and ensure we have the resources to take on Vern Buchanan and win. The bottom line is that in order to defeat Vern, we’re going to need money, and lots of it. Vern has already taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from corporate PACs and there’s no telling how much money he’s going to loan his campaign from his personal fortune. We can’t let Vern and his corporate donors buy this election. So it’s up to grassroots supporters like you to help us reach our online fundraising goals month after month if we want to win this race and defeat Vern. We’re only $7,150 away from reaching the ambitious $20,000 online fundraising goal we’ve set for the month, and you can help us reach it by making a contribution before Friday’s deadline.

Alex, We’ve got big news: our race was featured in Newsweek! Why? Because our campaign may hold the key to securing Florida’s 29 electoral college votes and winning the White House. Our race is key to flipping Florida blue — one of the only races nationwide where we can work together to not only flip our congressional seat blue, but to flip the biggest battleground state in the nation, and set us all on the path to victory and bring accountability to Washington. We know that we are going to face a barrage of attacks from national groups as we get closer to the general election. That’s why Margaret is relying on you to help ensure we have the resources necessary to fight back. An investment in our campaign is an investment in flipping Florida blue, keeping control of the House of Representatives, and winning the White House.

I’ll get right to the point. Alex, I’ll get right to the point. In order to fully fund our Get Out The Vote efforts in the final days of this campaign, we need to raise another $13,750 to reach our $25,000 goal -- and I’m counting on grassroots supporters like you to help us reach it. This race could be decided by just a handful of votes, which is why we have to do everything we can to turn out as many voters as possible between now and Tuesday. If we turn out enough voters to flip this seat from red to blue, we can also help Joe Biden win in Florida -- the biggest battleground state in the entire country.

“Education Secretary Betsy DeVos plans to move ahead with a policy that would boost the share of coronavirus relief dollars to private school students by writing it into a new regulation.” -Morning Education Hi Alex, As a state representative, Margaret prioritized public school funding and vocally opposed and voted against the privatization of our public schools. Along with Americans across the country, she has been horrified by this Administration’s gutting of public education, and the latest decision from Betsy DeVos is no different. DeVos continues to favor private schools in the distribution of COVID-19 relief, further weakening our public schools that are already devastated by funding cuts and often rely on local funding to provide vital curriculum to students. We desperately need leadership in Washington who will fight for everyone’s right to quality education. If you believe that our students deserve better, add your name here.

We are so close! Alex, I just got word from our team: as we head into the final day of our big end-of-month fundraising push, we’re now just $6,923 away from reaching our goal! We are so close! With Vote by Mail ballots arriving in voters’ mailboxes soon, we don’t have a moment to waste. We need to get television ads on the air, send out mail, and get our digital ads up and running before voters begin casting their ballots and time is running out. Can you pitch in before midnight tonight to push us over the finish line and ensure we reach our end-of-month fundraising goal? It’s critical we reach this goal to fund our voter outreach efforts in the coming weeks. This campaign represents the people, not special interests. And together, we can protect Social Security, fund the Postal Service, and recover from this pandemic. But first, I need your help to flip this seat, so I can represent you and our shared values in Washington. Please, click here to rush a contribution of any amount you can afford before our midnight deadline. We can’t flip this seat blue, flip Florida blue, and win the White House without your help. Thank you for supporting our campaign to restore accountability to Washington.

Click here to help us reach our $20,000 fundraising goal before midnight, we’re only $1,750 away! From ensuring the interests of actual people are put ahead of the interests of corporations, to restoring accountability to Washington, protecting our environment, and ensuring that everyone has access to the health care they need — the stakes couldn’t be higher in this election. The bottom line is that Vern Buchanan embodies all that is wrong with Washington, and as one of the most corrupt members of Congress, it’s past time we made a change. We can flip this seat from red to blue, I’ve done it before and I can do it again. But in order to do that we need the resources to fight back against the massive sums of money he’s taking from corporate PACs. While Vern has taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from corporate special interests, I refuse to take corporate PAC money, because I believe in representing the people, not corporations. Our government shouldn’t be for sale to the highest bidder, and this is your opportunity to show that a campaign powered by the people is more powerful than their campaign that’s funded by corporations. Alex, click here to contribute any amount you can afford before our midnight fundraising deadline, so we can show Vern and his corporate allies that we have the support we need to flip this seat.

Alex, I’m humbled by the support you’ve shown me over the past few months. Thanks to supporters here on the Suncoast, across Florida, and around the country — we raised more than $1.1 million for the fundraising quarter, which is more than double what our campaign has raised in any previous quarter! What makes this big news even more impressive is that I haven’t taken a single dollar from corporate PACs — it’s all thanks to people like you who contributed what they could to help me flip this seat from red to blue. Vern Buchanan is so concerned about our campaign’s fundraising progress, not only is he taking tons of money from corporate PACS, he has been forced to loan his campaign money repeatedly — and with less than a month until Election Day he will undoubtedly try to prop up his lagging campaign with his own money again. That’s where you come in, Alex. Can you contribute for the first time right now to help keep our momentum growing and provide our campaign with the resources we need to fight back against Vern’s corporate backers and his personal loans to his campaign?

We can flip this district from red to blue and show Vern what real leadership looks like, but it’s going to take all of us, working together.

The lack of concern shown by the Trump administration is immoral, callous, and dangerous. Alex, With record numbers of families facing unemployment, thousands have lost their health insurance coverage. And as COVID-19 continues to spread, the Trump administration filed a legal brief to strike down the Affordable Care Act last week.

Stand with Margaret and add your name to send a message to Trump that we should be expanding access to health insurance, not cutting it.

And rather than ensuring Americans are safe, healthy, and able to work, Trump continues to prioritize the wealth of few Americans over the well-being of millions.

Given her record, we already know that Margaret will be a strong voice for every community in Florida’s 16th District. And she will bring the same leadership to Congress that has guided her community work prior to serving in public office. Margaret’s strong record of running — and winning — means that she is ready to step up and take on an entrenched Republican incumbent with a record of hurting the communities he purports to represent. In just 48 hours, Margaret’s facing the toughest public filing deadline yet of her campaign. Can you donate $15 or more to her campaign today to make sure she finishes this quarter in the strongest position possible? Republicans are doing everything they can to win, and with all eyes on Florida, we have to make sure Margaret knows we’re on her side. Vice President Pence has already paid a visit to the District — so we know the GOP is worried. In 2018, EMILY’s List helped a record-breaking number of women get elected to Congress — and with your help, we can keep building on that success.

Alex, We are less than two months away from Election Day and only a matter of days before voters begin receiving their ballots in the mail, and I wanted to send you a personal note about how much your support means to me and our campaign ahead of our last Federal Elections Commission end-of-quarter fundraising deadline of the election.

The Trump administration’s efforts to undermine one of America’s most respected public servants, Dr. Anthony Fauci, is uncalled for and dangerous. Dr. Fauci has stood up to the administration and put the American people first despite the repeated criticisms from President Trump and members of his administration. Alex, The Trump administration’s efforts to undermine one of America’s most respected public servants, Dr. Anthony Fauci, is uncalled for and dangerous. Dr. Fauci has stood up to the administration and put the American people first despite the repeated criticisms from President Trump and members of his administration. He is speaking out to ensure we hear the truth about the coronavirus and letting us know what we should be doing to limit its spread. In other words, he’s doing his job. We can’t let the Trump administration destroy Dr. Fauci’s reputation in the midst of this crisis when the American people need trusted advice. Alex, add your name today to say you stand with Dr. Fauci in the face of these outrageous attacks by the Trump administration. This pandemic is not a game: it’s a clear threat to our health, our economy, and the world. Now more than ever, we need to listen to public health officials like Dr. Fauci. The last thing that should be happening is the disparagement of medical experts that are working to protect us from this devastating virus. Everyone should be following Dr. Fauci’s directives. We can’t afford to have anyone mistrust what he is advising the American people to do to protect themselves. We need to trust our medical experts and put science above all else during this difficult time. Can you add your name right now to show Dr. Fauci that you have his back as he faces attacks from the Trump administration? Thank you for supporting science and the public health officials that are working to protect us.

You’re getting this email because you’re interested in electing leaders who will listen to people, work hard, and do the right thing; even when it means working with those you don’t always agree with. Margaret Good is running for Congress because she knows we must end the partisan politics that hurt working families and do what’s right for a change. Margaret will bring the same work ethic and common sense leadership to Congress that has guided her as a non-profit leader, attorney, and legislator in order to make government work for Florida’s 16th district. Margaret is counting on supporters like you to help her keep up the fight and flip Florida’s 16th blue. But, if you’re not interested in joining our effort, you can unsubscribe at any time. * * * Alex, My name is Margaret Good and I’m running for Congress in Florida’s 16th district. At a time when divisive and hostile rhetoric is flooding our political discourse, it’s more important than ever to rise above the partisan bickering and tackle real issues that impact real Americans. Growing up as the daughter of an Episcopal priest and a nurse, I learned from a young age the importance of helping those around us and lending a hand when our neighbors are struggling. It’s why I made a career out of public service. And when a seat in the Florida Legislature opened up last year, I knew it was an opportunity to make a real difference in our community. What happened next was incredible: We united thousands of people across Southwest Florida and built a coalition strong enough to win a special election in a deep-red district. Now, it’s time to come together again, put aside our differences, and fight for our common goals and for the common good. We’re going to do this, but not without you. I need you to join me. For more than a decade, Congressman Buchanan has neglected Southwest Florida values and pushed our priorities aside to cater to the interests of Washington insiders. As our challenges have grown deeper and more complex, he continues to turn a blind eye to constituents and their needs by taking the easy way out. I’m running because the people of Florida’s 16th District deserve more than partisanship and political games. I’m running because we need to support our veterans, protect our environment, provide quality education to our young people, and make sure that people don’t go broke getting the healthcare they need. I’ll never stop fighting for our collective future -- and that means reaching across the aisle and finding solutions that cross the partisan divide. Congress can do so much more with our resources, and we deserve so much better than our current representative. That’s why I’m running, and why I’m so glad to have you with us in this fight. Thanks for joining our team, \-- Margaret Good To be removed from this email list, please unsubscribe . PAID FOR AND AUTHORIZED BY MARGARET GOOD FOR CONGRESS P.O. Box 5073 Sarasota, FL 34277

I’ll get right to the point. Hi Alex, I’ll get right to the point. I’m reaching out to you one last time to ask for your help just hours before the biggest fundraising deadline our campaign has faced thus far. As we head into the General Election period, we need to be in the strongest position possible to take on Vern Buchanan and the corporate interests backing his campaign. Operatives from Vern’s campaign will be poring over our fundraising numbers -- let’s show them what they’re up against -- the power of the people. Alex, can you make your first investment in our campaign before tonight’s critical FEC Primary Election deadline? Use this secure link right now: [[URL REDACTED]] The people of the Suncoast deserve a representative who will bring accountability to Washington, deliver common sense solutions to the problems we face every day, and above all else, someone who they can count on to get things done.

Alex, Labor Day is not only a day of rest for workers across our nation, it’s a day of reflection and recognition for all the work we put in day after day to strengthen our communities and provide for our families. And we must also reflect and thank our brothers and sisters in the Labor Movement that brought us the 40-hour work week, the minimum wage, and critical protections for workers. I want to thank all the workers here on the Suncoast, across Florida, and our nation that help keep things running. Especially our essential workers and our first responders that are on the front lines during this pandemic, risking their health to keep our economy moving and helping people in need. Workers are the backbone of our economy, and should be treated with the respect they deserve. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case. That’s why I’m fighting to lift up workers and rebuild our economy from the ground up. I will always advocate on behalf of workers, and if you can help me win this election, I will bring their fight to Congress and I will work as hard as you work every day to ensure workers are protected and supported in every way possible.

Alex, We are just five days away from the end of the quarter — our final quarterly fundraising deadline of the election! It can’t be overstated how important this deadline is to our campaign and the outcome of this election — which is why I need your help right now. Vern Buchanan’s campaign, the media, and the pundits will be poring over our campaign finance report to look for any signs of weakness, and we need to show them that our campaign is stronger than ever and it’s all thanks to a groundswell of grassroots supporters like you. That’s where you come in, Alex. We have to raise $30,000 over the next five days to meet our goal. It’s critical we reach it in order to flip this seat from red to blue, turn out the voters we and Joe Biden need to win Florida, and deliver accountability to Washington.

Hi Alex, Shayne let me know this morning that we are still $6,000 shy of our online fundraising goal — a gap I’m certain we can close before midnight — with your help. Alex, can you rush a contribution before our public filing deadline at midnight to ensure we don’t fall short? We’re going to win this race as we’ve won races in the past — with grassroots support and committed people who create the power that defines our momentum. A critical part of that winning playbook is hitting our fundraising goals to ensure we have the resources necessary to execute our plan. The GOP, the pundits, and our allies all will be assessing the numbers we report to gauge the likelihood of us flipping this seat. But, it’s not just that, we must hit our goals so that we have the resources to take back Florida in November. Alex, falling short isn’t an option.

When I was a little girl, my mom would ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up. My answer was always the same: a professional baseball player, or President of the United States. Alex, When I was a little girl, my mom would ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up. My answer was always the same: a professional baseball player, or President of the United States. She inevitably would respond that, when she was growing up, she felt like she had only two choices: she could be either a teacher or a nurse. She became a nurse and spent her entire career helping people when they needed it most. My two aunts became teachers, devoting their lives to educating future generations. I will always be immensely proud of my family and their commitment to their communities and their careers, but hearing that from my mom -- that she felt her choices were so limited -- has always stayed with me, driven me, and inspired me throughout my life. My mom has made me determined to build a world where people do not feel that their opportunities are limited because of who they are. That is why I started out working in nonprofits like City Year and the United Way, and then, because I wanted more choices, I went to law school, and ran for office. My mom inspired me to build a better world for everyone, where our opportunities are not limited because of who we are. Where we all can pursue our dreams and our passions. Together, we have an opportunity to flip this congressional seat blue and create real change. Will you join me and my mom in working to build a better, fairer world, where our opportunities are limitless?

I knew running for Congress would be hard work, but rewarding, however, I had no idea we would face these unprecedented times or that we would be re-writing the playbook on how to campaign in 2020. Hi Alex, I knew running for Congress would be hard work, but rewarding, however, I had no idea we would face these unprecedented times or that we would be re-writing the playbook on how to campaign in 2020. But, I knew that no matter what we faced, we would rise to the occasion. I was confident we would rise to the occasion because of our incredible supporters — like you — who step up time and again. Now, when we hold a Zoom event, have a deadline to meet, or simply need your support getting the word out about our campaign on social media, you all are there. Thank you.

As promised, we're writing back with the results of the survey we did earlier this month. Margaret knows one of the most critical parts of being a successful legislator is the ability to step back and listen to the people she serves: her constituents and her community—and then to be accountable to them on the issues that matter. Alex, As promised, we're writing back with the results of the survey we did earlier this month. Margaret knows one of the most critical parts of being a successful legislator is the ability to step back and listen to the people she serves: her constituents and her community—and then to be accountable to them on the issues that matter. The results from the feedback were emphatic and clear. The top three issues that Margaret's supporters care about are: 1. Healthcare 2. Clean water and clean air 3. Protecting Social Security and other social safety nets These were followed closely by curbing gun violence and making the economy work for everyone. These issues, as well as other issues you and your family care about, will continue to be the bedrock of Margaret's work when you send her to Washington to fight for us. We also wanted to share a few thoughts supporters shared with us: Nancy knows we have to keep working to bring people together: "Everything you listed is important to me. Bringing people together is critically important. The country's state of mind is too divisive. We need everyone to think about each other and not just 'me.' After that, everything can work." Brian and Anne-Marie both agree that climate change and our environment have to come first: "Climate change: the existential threat to the planet!" "I care about all of these issues (education, healthcare) but truly believe the most urgent is environmental. Plus, our entire state economy depends on tourism tied to our environment." Strengthening our safety net and infrastructure are of utmost importance to Steven: "I think we must strengthen our safety net programs at the state and local level given the depression we are currently experiencing. At the state level, the Republican legislature has paid little attention to infrastructure across government as the failures at Public Health and Labor so clearly demonstrate. The electorate needs to understand that these are the actions of a do-nothing Republican legislature." Cynthia Leigh believes we have to put access to affordable healthcare front and center: "I retired early and had to pay for health insurance on my own. With Medicare, the yearly premiums and deductibles for hospitalization, doctor visits, and drugs are less than $5,000 annually, or 70% less than before. Access to affordable health care should be available for all and not based on income or job." And finally, Robert advocates for vote-by-mail options for all: "I am a Disabled Vietnam Veteran with PTSD, and I did not vote for some 10 years after I returned home. It's still difficult to be a part of such crowds, and especially now with COVID, we need to have vote-by-mail options for everyone." We thank everyone who participated in this survey, and as we continue to focus on grassroots change and building this movement, we will work to center these issues in our campaign.

Alex, If you missed my debate with Vern Buchanan last week, here’s a lowlight: Vern said I don’t have any friends. Yeah, you heard that right. It’s a pretty childish attack, I know. Clearly, Vern is unaware of the outpouring of support we’ve received from Democrats, Republicans, and Independents across the district. The truth is our network of supporters starts here on the Suncoast and spans across the state of Florida, and around the country. Click here to watch a video some of my friends made, and make a donation right now to help show Vern that our campaign has the support of friends like you. If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Donate $5 Now » Donate $10 Now » Donate $25 Now » Donate $50 Now » Donate $75 Now » Donate another amount. Our campaign has so many friends because voters want new leadership -- they are tired of corrupt politicians like Vern Buchanan who is more concerned with himself than the people of the Suncoast he’s supposed to represent. Together, we can expand access to affordable health care, protect our land and water, rebuild our economy, and deliver accountability to Washington. But to do that, I’m relying on your support.

Alex, I had a fabulous time at Margaret Good’s virtual fundraising event this evening! If you weren’t able to make it, I would be lying if I said you didn’t miss a single Star Trek reference. In all seriousness, I’m writing to thank all those who attended, and reinforce why Margaret will serve us well in Congress. Fifty-four years ago, I had the honor of being cast in a groundbreaking series that showed us what humanity could aspire to be. The United Federation of Planets charter affirms that we gain our strength from our diversity coming together with each contributing his or her unique talent working together in concert to boldly go where no one has gone before. We may be a few centuries away from that, but the equal rights and well-being of all Americans is exactly what we’re fighting for in this election. From access to affordable health care and protecting the environment, to delivering accountability to Washington — we need Margaret fighting for us. She’s smart, resilient, believes in science over fiction, and works tirelessly in her campaign to represent hardworking families. We can defeat the forces that want to turn back the clock on progress, but only if we can count on your support.

We are now just $10,735 away from hitting our mid-month fundraising goal, ensuring that we are on track to raising $50,000 by the end of the month!

But, if we are going to be able to have the resources we need to get out our message and win this election, it’s critical that we reach this fundraising goal.

Alex, While you can count on Margaret to do what she says she’ll do, Vern Buchanan has a shameful record of saying one thing and doing the opposite. Margaret said it best: Vern said he would help the economy, but voted against unemployment benefits. He opposed paid sick leave for essential workers during a health crisis. And if health care costs weren’t high enough already, he voted to gut protections for people with pre-existing conditions and raise costs on all of us. That’s Vern’s record, a shameful record of saying one thing and doing another, while putting corporate special interests ahead of the people. That’s why our new ad calls out Vern and sets the record straight. But in order to keep it on the air, we need your help.

Hi Alex, Five years ago the U.S. Supreme Court made marriage equality a reality for all Americans. It was a victory for the LGBTQ+ community, and a monumental step forward for justice and equality for all. Today, I'm overjoyed to invite you to our June 30th event themed around LGBTQ+ rights. The digital fundraiser will include special appearances from activists in the fight for equality, including Equality Florida Executive Director Nadine Smith, author and communications specialist Elizabeth Hines, and Roberta Kaplan, who represented Edie Windsor in the Supreme Court case that overturned the Defense of Marriage Act.

Our District and our state are key to President Trump winning re-election, that’s why the Republican convention is scheduled to be an in-person event in our state — it’s a last-ditch effort to host a publicity stunt that puts the lives of Floridians in danger.

Alex, We have a big fundraising deadline on Wednesday at midnight and I want to take a few minutes to explain why this deadline is so important. Our final Federal Elections Commission quarterly report is due at the end of the month, and we can’t afford to fall short of our $30,000 goal. This deadline is important for the campaign: We have built a budget that allows us to communicate with voters across the district. If we don’t meet our goals, we can’t communicate. It’s that simple. But, I also know that we WILL meet our goals, because we have thousands of supporters who are as determined as I am to create the change we deserve. This deadline is also important to show strength: Vern Buchanan’s campaign team and the media will be combing over our report looking for any signs of weakness and we must show that we continue to run a campaign that is powered by us, the people, not corporate special interests. We are gaining momentum every day, but we have to keep pushing. This isn’t a race for the faint of heart -- we are fighting every single day for every single vote and we need you there with us. We are still $14,735 short of our goal, and need you to rush a contribution right now to help us close the gap before our last FEC end-of-quarter deadline of the election. If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Donate $5 Now » Donate $10 Now » Donate $25 Now » Donate $50 Now » Donate $75 Now » Donate another amount. We can’t fall behind during this critical moment in our campaign, and I’m counting on you to help lift us up.

Alex, Every time we come up against a major deadline, I’ve counted on the support of our grassroots movement -- and each time, you push us across the finish line. Now, this race is statistically tied and we need your help. This has been a big week: we got back polling results showing us neck and neck; I appeared on Morning Joe to talk about the importance of flipping this district to ensure the integrity of the election; and we found out our grassroots organization outraised one of the wealthiest members of Congress 3 to 1 last quarter! But, Vern Buchanan has more cash in the bank than us and his corporate backers know we are coming for him. They are launching attack after attack against us, and we need your help if we are going to have the resources to continue to fight back and flip this seat from red to blue. Tonight is the last chance to have your donation matched to give your contribution double the impact. Alex, before midnight, contribute what you can at this secured link and have your contribution automatically doubled: [[URL REDACTED]] I got into this race knowing it was going to be a tough fight, but I am running because I believe with every fiber of who I am that we deserve more from our government -- that we deserve leaders that actually work for the people they serve.

Today’s the day! Alex, Today’s the day! Vote by Mail ballots are officially being mailed to voters’ mailboxes — and that means we have to push even harder. Vern Buchanan and the special interests backing him are spending heavily and launching attacks against Margaret, hoping they can use their negative attacks to win this election. But we know that won’t work. We believe in a new kind of campaign: a campaign built up from the grassroots, that focuses on what we can achieve together, not what keeps us apart. Voters are getting ready to cast their ballots now, so we need to be able to fight back against these attacks and get our message out. We’re just $3,021 away from hitting our goal.

I want you to be among the first to know about our first television ad! I hope you have a moment to watch about why I’m running for office. Alex, I want you to be among the first to know about our first television ad! I hope you have a moment to watch about why I’m running for office. When you are raised by a pastor and a nurse, and your family has a history of service, you learn to fix problems — not complain about them. Right now Congress is at a standstill, because they are more concerned with politics than getting things done. I’ll work with anyone who’s ready to get results for the people of Florida and our nation. Click here to watch our new television ad, funded by the people — not corporate PACs. Thanks to an outpouring of support from people like you who want to bring real change to Florida and our nation, we were able to get this new ad up on television, starting tomorrow!! But, it’s going to take a lot of resources to keep it on the air. In order to keep it up, I need your help right now. Can you contribute today before our big fundraising deadline tonight at midnight?

It’s thanks to the grassroots members of our team who have shown they believe in Margaret and are ready to do what it takes to flip this seat that our campaign continues to get national attention. Progressive groups are watching this race, which is why I’m so proud to announce Margaret’s latest endorsement from BOLD PAC. Hi Alex, One of my favorite things about this campaign is the fact that it’s powered by people: grassroots supporters from around Southwest Florida and across the country who want to send bold, new leadership to Washington. It’s thanks to the grassroots members of our team who have shown they believe in Margaret and are ready to do what it takes to flip this seat that our campaign continues to get national attention. Progressive groups are watching this race, which is why I’m so proud to announce Margaret’s latest endorsement from BOLD PAC. They understand that Margaret’s leadership in Washington will be an asset, and her creative approach to solving problems is desperately needed. This endorsement is just the latest example of the strength of our campaign — but we can’t afford to slow down. One of the best ways to support the campaign and help us continue the momentum is to pledge a sustaining contribution to ensure Margaret has the resources she needs to win this fight. But, as we make gains in our district and across the country, we know the GOP is closely watching us. It’s why we don’t take any of these endorsements for granted and why grassroots support for this campaign is critical. We rely on contributions from supporters like you so we have the resources it takes to respond to the inevitable attacks from the GOP.

Alex, I am proud to support Margaret Good as she works to flip Florida’s 16th Congressional District from red to blue, and I’ll tell you why: Margaret is a fighter for Florida’s environmental future. Margaret understands that the decisions we make right now will impact our environment for years to come. In Congress, she will continue to stand up to special interests and polluters, and take real action on climate change. If we are going to keep control of the House of Representatives and enact a real agenda to protect our environment, we need Margaret’s voice. Can you join me in supporting her by chipping in to her campaign right now? Margaret has fought to improve our water quality, sponsored bold legislation to begin Florida’s transition to clean energy, and advocated for full funding of land preservation. Her opponent, Vern Buchanan, voted to roll back Clean Water Act protections, voted for the “Poison Our Waters Act,” and voted to allow oil drilling off our coasts. Margaret is the only real environmental champion in this race, and it shows. That is why Margaret Good has been endorsed by the League of Conservation Voters and received an “A” rating by the Sierra Club, while her opponent has one of the worst environmental records in Congress. We cannot afford to wait any longer to fight climate change, protect our environment, and create good, well-paying clean energy jobs. Please, join me in supporting Margaret’s campaign today. Together, we can flip this district blue, send Margaret to Congress, and work to protect our environment against polluters and special interests.

Alex, South Carolina is currently experiencing the third worst COVID-19 outbreak in the world. Things are so bad that Taiwan donated 92,000 surgical masks to our frontline healthcare workers, because we are failing to keep them safe. Alex, I’m gonna keep it real: This is a disgrace. Our state’s refusal to address this health crisis has cost thousands of lives, and there is no end in sight. Our leaders are STILL failing us. Earlier this week, Gov. McMaster ordered schools to reopen for in-person classes in the fall, despite warnings from superintendent Molly Spearman, the Palmetto State Teachers Association, South Carolina Education Association, SC for Ed, and the American Association of Pediatrics. And incredibly, South Carolina STILL doesn’t have a mask mandate in place! Even Alabama has issued a mandate to wear face masks in public. This isn’t just about common sense — it’s about common decency. Everyone should be wearing a mask right now — if not for yourself, then for your loved ones, your neighbors, and your community. The CDC is predicting that we could get this virus under control in just 4 to 8 weeks if we all wear masks — yet our own congressman, Rep. Ralph Norman, continues to walk on the House floor without one. Alex, I’m angry. I’m angry because I’ve seen the human toll of COVID-19 firsthand — I lost my granny to this virus in April — and I know that we can prevent other families from feeling the pain that I felt. All we have to do is put politics aside and come together as a South Carolina community. But as angry as I am, I’m not giving up. I will keep working to build the kind of grassroots movement that can elect better leaders for our state. That’s what this all comes down to — a better South Carolina. A stronger community. We will get there. Thanks for standing with me, — Moe DONATE * * * Moe Brown served as team captain for the USC Gamecocks and brought 5,000 jobs to the state through his work with the Department of Commerce.

Alex, We are learning some troubling information about Florida’s COVID-19 tracking. The architect and manager of Florida’s official COVID-19 dashboard was forced out of her position. Rebekah Jones said that her removal was "not voluntary" and that it was because she was ordered to censor some data but she refused to "manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen." The lack of transparency and manipulation of data is not only dishonest, but dangerous. Our elected officials must share accurate information to keep the public informed, and those who are compiling the data shouldn’t be punished if the data does not support a particular point of view. I’m running to restore common sense and transparency in Congress, but I need your help to get there. If you’re able, please make a grassroots donation to our campaign today. We need our economy to reopen and for business to resume, but it must be done safely and responsibly. During this process, our leaders must be fully transparent to help prevent a second wave of infections, which would shut down our economy once again and lead to the further loss of life. We must be able to trust our government leaders, especially when life and death decisions are being made. Please help us keep building the resources needed to win and bring more transparency to Congress.

More tough news: 27 million Americans have lost their job-based health coverage. Alex, More tough news: 27 million Americans have lost their job-based health coverage during the coronavirus pandemic. It’s the worst possible time to lose health insurance and wildly expensive COBRA coverage just isn’t an option for many families. I’ve repeatedly called for an expansion of Florida’s Medicaid program, which some of these workers would be eligible for. Other people are eligible for subsidized coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and our campaign has been helping them get covered. But some families don’t have any good options and they can’t wait until November. That’s why we’ve called for a special ACA open enrollment window, a common sense request the Trump Administration is still refusing as they pressure the Supreme Court to completely overturn the ACA. Meanwhile, my opponent is pretending to be bipartisan this week. But there is nothing bipartisan about voting to leave 23 million Americans without health insurance or voting to increase health insurance premiums. That’s his record. My support for Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care Act comes from my belief that every American should have the healthcare they need. Healthcare is why we must win in November. There isn’t another option. If you’re able, please donate today on behalf of the families who are struggling without health insurance right now. Thank you for being part of our campaign to make sure healthcare is a right.

Last week, my opponent tried to claim he is bipartisan and unifying, but it didn’t take long for him to start attacking us. Alex, Last week, my opponent tried to claim he is bipartisan and unifying, but it didn’t take long for him to start attacking us. Today he joined a partisan attack on one of our staff members who was standing up for Americans who just lost their jobs and healthcare. There’s nothing unifying about this, especially when he should be making sure people have healthcare. We can’t let this go unanswered. Can you send a donation today to help us respond? While they play political games, we’ll continue to help families who are struggling at no fault of their own. 27 million Americans lost their job-based healthcare since the coronavirus pandemic began. Our campaign has been answering their questions and providing information to help them get covered. Instead of lobing partisan attacks, shouldn’t my opponent be focused on how the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression is impacting healthcare for millions of people? That’s where my energy is. I’m running for Congress to make sure everyone has the healthcare they need. Chip in right now if you believe that’s the common sense leadership we deserve. Thank you.

Alex, Yesterday, my opponent said he supports cutting funding for the World Health Organization (WHO), and I couldn’t disagree more. It’s common sense that when you are battling an illness you don't stop paying your doctors and nurses. Defunding the World Health Organization in the middle of a global pandemic, is just not smart. In fact, it's reckless and it's playing politics with people's lives. Let’s call this what it is: a distraction from the Federal Government’s missteps in preparing for the pandemic. Join me in calling for the continuation of WHO funding. My opponent also claimed we’ll be ready to start opening up the economy by early May. I hope that’s possible. We all want to get back to work. But in order to open safely we must know the extent of the spread. That requires a lot more testing than we are doing now. The utter failure of the Federal Government to address the lack of testing and fully confront this health crisis is what is holding us back, period. People are hurting. We want our economy back. Wishful thinking and parroting tired talking points are not a plan, nor will it make this crisis go away. Public health leaders need funding and more testing to get us through this pandemic. Add your name to send a message: don’t cut WHO funding during a global health crisis. We must ramp up testing and tracing to open safely. Lives are at stake and so is the long term health of our economy.

Alex, I’ve heard from many parents and educators who want to reopen schools but are worried about the health risks. Our elected leaders should listen. We need Congress to finish passing the HEROES Act – which my opponent voted against – so our schools have the funding they need to reopen schools without putting educators and students at risk. This lack of funding isn’t new. For years, our public schools have been shortchanged. Our educators have been underpaid and many of our schools are in disrepair. In Congress, I will support more funding so we can attract the best and brightest and reinvest in our public schools. With these common sense goals in mind, I’m thrilled to be endorsed by the National Education Association! Will you make a grassroots donation today in support of our educators and students? They are counting on us to win this race and we must have the resources to do it. Our children are the future of this country and yet we continually shortchange their education. With your support, I will go to Congress and change that.

Alex, My opponent has been on a roll lately – and not in a good way. In June, he voted against the HEROES Act, which would have extended the unemployment benefits that expired Friday. It also provided funding that would help schools reopen safely. Last week, he voted against two bills with bipartisan support that would give child care providers and families the flexibility they need during the pandemic. One bill provided grants for providers to reopen safely and the other made child care more affordable for families. This is unacceptable. Please send a grassroots donation to help me put an end to these attacks on working women and mothers. 81% of women in a recent survey said child care affects their ability to work. 92% of child care workers are women. Child care is essential for our economy. President Trump’s mandate for schools to reopen (albeit without proper planning and funding) acknowledges this fact. So why, in the middle of a pandemic with millions of Americans still unemployed, is my opponent making it harder for women to work? It’s common sense we need child care. As your next congresswoman, I will make sure women are supported in the workplace. Chip in today in support of working women, mothers, and their families.

Please note that polls close at 7 p.m. tonight. If you haven't already, go vote! Even though Donna isn't on the ballot today, we must exercise our right to vote. – Team Donna Alex, On this day 100 years ago, the 19th Amendment was officially ratified, and women secured the right to vote. If you haven’t already voted in Florida’s primary election, please honor this day by casting your ballot before 7 p.m. tonight. It’s worth remembering that securing the right to vote is the result of dedicated commitment, over the better part of a century, from courageous, persistent and determined women. In November, we have a chance to elect a leader who will bring common sense, civility, compassion, and a fearless determination to get things done. That is why I am honored to endorse Donna Deegan for Congress on this historic day. Watch my video to find out why I’m supporting Donna – and why you should too. In 2018, I was a first-time candidate, just like Donna. I heard way too many times that I couldn’t win and that I should sit this one out. But, like Donna, when your community needs help, I believe that fear isn’t a reason to stay on the sidelines hoping for change. As a three-time breast cancer survivor, Donna heard from countless women who shared their struggles with cancer, so Donna launched the DONNA Foundation and world renowned National Marathon to Finish Breast Cancer. They’ve helped nearly 14,000 underserved families and funded groundbreaking research. Too many politicians are lowering themselves to incite fear and division during these challenging times. Donna is committed to getting things done with honorable service and principled action inclusive of, and respectful to, all people. We need her in Congress and that is why I’m asking you to donate to her campaign today. Our history is filled with examples of women taking action because it is hard.

Alex, Our intelligence community identified a Russian plot to pay bounties for killing American troops in Afghanistan. It is increasingly clear the President was briefed on this many months ago, yet his administration still has not acted. My opponent, who sits on the Appropriations subcommittee for Veterans Affairs and represents a military community, is once again silent. Why isn’t he calling for an investigation? It’s just one more example of him putting party before people. I will be a congresswoman who will show up for our service members no matter the party of the President. But I need your support to do that. It is common sense that if a foreign government is trying to kill your soldiers, you don’t do them favors. You make them stop. Who knew what and when in our government? What has been done to hold Russia accountable? Our military families deserve answers and there should be an immediate investigation. We are only $1,987 from our online end-of-quarter fundraising goal. Chip in before midnight tonight to send a message that our military women and men come first.

Alex, On Friday, the new unemployment rate and April job losses will be reported. We need to prepare ourselves for some shocking numbers not seen since the Great Depression. In Florida, our train wreck of an unemployment system has caused hundreds of thousands of Floridians to wait weeks and weeks for any relief, if they’re fortunate enough to even get through and not have their applications denied outright. Many people who lost their jobs also lost their healthcare and now they’re forced to make tough decisions about what their family can afford. It’s why our campaign held a webinar for people who lost employer-provided health insurance and why we called on President Trump to open a special Affordable Care Act (ACA) enrollment window. So far, the Trump Administration has ignored our common sense request and they’re actively arguing in court to get rid of the ACA all together. Likewise, my opponent has voted repeatedly to dismantle the ACA and kick 23 million off their healthcare. The people of Florida’s 4th District deserve a leader who believes healthcare should be expanded, and that’s why I’m running. Can I count on your support? Even if you can’t afford to give today, please know how grateful I am to have you on our team. By working together, we’ll make sure healthcare is a right.

We’ve lost 22 million jobs across the country and that number will continue to grow. Alex, It has been a challenging time over the last few weeks, and we have more ahead of us. Social distancing hasn’t been easy even though it’s what we all must do to keep each other safe. I’m really missing face to face interactions with family, friends, and neighbors. I’m sure you are too. Fortunately, the technology at our fingertips is helping us meet virtually, which has come in handy to connect with you in new ways. It’s allowed us to see faces, share smiles, and support each other. Technology has also helped us continue the work of this campaign and our efforts to bring common sense to Florida’s 4th District. With that goal in mind, you’re invited to our next event. Join me for a virtual reception with Rep. Lois Frankel and our gracious hosts, Andrew Barnhill and Nancy Soderberg, on Tuesday, April 28 from 7:30pm – 8:30pm ET. I want to hear more about how your family is doing, to discuss how we move our country forward, and to share a smile or two with each other, as they are needed now more than ever. See you on the 28th! Thank you, Donna Donna Deegan is a Democrat running for Congress in Florida’s 4th District that covers the First Coast in Nassau, Duval and St. Johns counties.

Alex, This email is a little long, so please bear with me. I have a lot on my mind today as I’m sure you do too! We now know that the Federal Government disregarded warnings about the coming pandemic throughout January and February. Yesterday we learned that Florida’s state government also knew and wasted valuable time by saying nothing to the public. New estimates from Columbia University found that if social distancing started one week earlier, we would have lost 36,000 fewer people. Two weeks earlier and we would have saved 54,000 lives. We need leaders who believe in science, who trust the experts, and who will be transparent. I promise to be that leader in Congress, but I need your support to have the opportunity. As of today, more than 38 million Americans are out of work. How many jobs could we have saved by acting sooner? We lost valuable time when our state and federal political leaders were failing to act and were keeping critical information from the public. In times of crisis, the public must have trust in its government and transparency creates that trust. We can’t have it when the government is hiding data and information, firing experts, and retaliating against whistleblowers. Please make a grassroots donation today so I can bring common sense and transparency back to Congress. This is still a hard time to ask for money, but I know what it will take to win this race. I also know we will get there together! If you’re not able to give today, I completely understand. The most important thing I could ever ask for is your voice and your vote. I’m so grateful to have it. Thank you, Donna Donna Deegan is a Democrat running for Congress in Florida’s 4th District that covers the First Coast in Nassau, Duval and St. Johns counties.

“People have common sense, and nobody has ever heard of a trial without witnesses.” Alex — Angus King said it best: “People have common sense, and nobody has ever heard of a trial without witnesses.” And that was before John Bolton’s manuscript leaked. Susan Collins likes to claim she’s an independent voice — but she’s been hemming and hawing about witnesses for weeks. It was clear to Angus King over the weekend. It’s abundantly clear to all Mainers, too. Susan Collins is on the sidelines instead of fighting for our country. Add your name to our petition to demand witness testimony. >> Here in Maine, we don’t believe in fair-weather friends. We live with honesty and integrity — and I’m in this race because we need a Senator who will bring those values to DC, instead of checking with Mitch McConnell before every move.

# As you may have heard, there’s a public health crisis unfolding in our nation’s meat and poultry processing plants. States across the country have reported coronavirus outbreaks in processing plants — and now thousands of essential workers are falling ill. Here in Mississippi, the situation is getting worse by the day. We can overcome it if we act with determination and common sense — which is why I decided to share my thoughts on this crisis in an op-ed in Agri-Pulse, and I wanted to make sure you saw it. At first glance, the president’s executive order to send employees back to work appears to be straightforward means of averting widespread food shortages. But the directive lays out no plan for ensuring the health and economic security of the processing plant workers. There is a better way to do this. I know from experience. During the 1990s, I served in the U.S. Department of Agriculture as the nation’s 25th secretary of agriculture. On my third day in office, we were notified of multiple deaths among children who had apparently eaten undercooked hamburger meat. We needed to act fast to prevent further deaths. The department quickly tracked down the source of the meat to certain beef processing plants where the lines were moving so fast that inspectors failed to detect the virulent E. coli pathogens that killed the children. We determined that the pathogens were lodged in hamburger grinding machines. Through fast, decisive action, we were able to mitigate the threat. We led the effort to impose further rules mandating rigorous inspections at each critical point in the beef processing cycle, and then imposed the same measures at poultry plants. Here’s what we can do right now to protect meat and poultry processing workers in Mississippi and across the country: * All workers must be tested for COVID-19 before plants are allowed to reopen * Those without symptoms may rejoin the workforce, but must be tested frequently * Plants also must be reconfigured to meet all CDC guidelines * Workers must have masks, aprons, eyewear, and gloves, and should be stationed at least six feet apart * All workers who are symptomatic or are found to have been exposed to the virus must be quarantined for the requisite period, and receive a mandatory full salary as federal emergency paid sick leave If we do these things to protect our workers, the rest will fall into place. I’ll keep demanding basic rights for essential workers — and that’s what I’ll continue doing in the U.S. Senate.

Team, We could list all of the terrible things that President Trump has done during this pandemic that have put millions of us at risk. The way he's been handling the response to the coronavirus is an affront to us all.

Like so many of you, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death left me stunned and deeply saddened. She was a force of a justice and a woman -- someone who was relentless in her pursuit of justice and grounded by her sense of right. She led a life striving towards making our country a better and fairer place up until her last breath. Her death also left me scared. Scared because I know that this administration will choose short-term political gain over precedent, political process, and a sense of right. And that decision could alter our lives and freedoms for generations. Ruth Bader Ginsburg lived her entire life in search of the good -- for all Americans. Now, it's our time to continue her path and make this election a referendum on what's right. That's why I'm encouraging you: vote, vote, vote. This is your opportunity to make your voice heard. If you need convincing, just look at how much has happened in these past four years. And, if you can, sign up to volunteer!

We're really close to this election. Like less than four weeks until people start receiving their mail-in ballots and less than eight weeks until this election is decided type of close. That means that what you give right now could make the difference. We just barely won our race in 2018. But, we did because enough of you came out and demanded change in Orange County. We need to do that again. That's why we've got to ask if you'll donate right now >> These final eight weeks can determine the trajectory of this race. We're neck-and-neck with our opponent, but we know she's going to pour money into TV ads throughout the district. That means it's on us to do everything we can to keep this seat -- and that depends on people like you giving us small donations during these critical weeks. Can you do that?

Tomorrow marks 80 days until Election Day. And we are still in one of the most competitive races across the entire country -- against an opponent who's risked lives with her coronavirus guidance, who's publicly made homophobic jokes, and who's standing by Trump at every move. That means these next 80 days are a sprint, and we need to lay it all out on the table. Unlike our opponent, who's raking in big checks from megadonors, our campaign is dependent on everyday folks like you who show that they care about who represents their interests in Congress. That's why we're offering Harley Rouda merchandise for anyone who donates over $25 to our campaign. Can you donate to our campaign today? Harley's victory in 2018 was the first Democrat victory in the district -- ever. And we won that race by doing everything that we could to spread Harley's message to Orange County voters. We need to do just as much -- if not more -- to secure Harley's re-election this year. That's why we're hoping you'll donate $25 or more to our race (and receive some merchandise to rep in return!) >> We're so glad you're part of our team! \-- Rouda HQ Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hi there -- I just wanted to follow up on Alyssa's email (forwarded below). I was shocked to read the article she mentioned in the Voice of Orange County. My opponent has made some ridiculous comments about coronavirus, like when she said it was "species discrimination" that humans have to wear masks even though dogs shouldn't. However, I was incensed that she would downplay coronavirus numbers and seemingly deceive the public on how coronavirus has impacted our county. We must ask for more from our public officials and demand transparency from those in charge of our county's response to the crisis. I'm asking if you'll donate to our campaign today because I will strive to be as open and honest as I can be -- and I hope you'll always hold me accountable to that. Can you donate today? Thank you! \-- Harley \---------- Forwarded message --------- Since the start of this pandemic, our opponent, Michelle Steel, has been overseeing Orange County's response to COVID-19. At best, her performance has been haphazard; at worst, it's been dangerous. Now, she's making completely false claims about how she's handled this crisis and how her response stacks up to the rest of the state. It's just adding insult to injury. Will you take a few minutes to read about how Michelle Steel misled the public on her coronavirus response? In the midst of a global health emergency that has claimed the lives of thousands of people, falsely buffering your county's statistics is more than just inaccurate -- it's morally reprehensible. It also shows how important it is to elect someone who will tell the truth, even if it doesn't make them look good. I know Harley is that leader, but we need your help to send him back to Washington. Will you donate today to help us re-elect him? Thank you! \-- Alyssa Napuri, Campaign Manager Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hi -- I want to make this brief and to the point: we really need your support today. Here's why: 1) There are 99 days until Election Day! That means we need to increase our fundraising right now. 2) Our end of the month deadline is Friday. Hitting our monthly fundraising goal will send the message that Harley's not going to back down. 3) Harley's opponent, Michelle Steel, brought in over $1 million last quarter. With Big Money, the NRCC, and her own deep pockets all funding her campaign, we can expect that she'll keep having huge fundraising performances. What do you say: can you give now?

Hi there, It's hard to overstate just how important it was to hit our fundraising goal this quarter. With my opponent and me locked in a dead heat this close to Election Day, deadlines like this one really can sway the momentum of this race. And, because of you, we hit our goal and are in a good place to reach the undecided voters we need before Election Day. I'm reaching out to personally thank you. When I made the decision to run for Congress, I decided that I was going to rely on grassroots donors -- not corporate special interests. So, when I say that this is all because of you, I truly do mean it. Now we've got 33 days to secure this election. And, it's not going to be easy. But, that's why I'm just so happy you're on our team. Together, I know that we can keep this seat blue and continue to make progress in Orange County and throughout the country.

Here's the deal: we have less than 80 days until Election Day, and we can't go out and reach voters the way we normally do. So, we're mixing things up. We're going to need everyone (and we mean everyone) to wear Harley shirts, use Harley masks, and rep Harley signs. We're also going to need to spend big on TV and digital ads to spread Harley's message. You can help us meet both of those goals by donating $25 or more to our campaign today and receiving a shirt, sign, or mask in return! Can you donate $25 today? This is the perfect time to give to the campaign -- because who doesn't like an extra gift with their donation? But, we're starting to run low, so you'll have to act quickly!

Hi there -- our end-of-quarter deadline is tonight at midnight -- and, in all honesty, hitting our goal is an essential step towards giving our grassroots campaign the momentum we need to keep this seat blue on Election Day. That's why I have to ask: can you donate to our campaign today? We know this race isn't going to be easy. It wasn't easy in 2018 when Harley became the first Democrat to win this seat ever. And it won't be easy today. Corporate special interest groups are flooding our race with Big Money, POLITICO has rated our race a toss-up, and Republicans make up the majority of our district. That's why donations from folks like you are so important. They help us reach the undecided voters in Orange County who could ultimately help determine who wins this race.

We all know who we look to when we want coronavirus guidance. Spoiler alert: it's usually not our president. Anthony Fauci has been our most reliable source of guidance on how to fight this pandemic since day one. And, we can't let Trump shuffle blame to him just to save face. Can you sign on to show Dr. Fauci that you're supporting him? Dr. Fauci has made sure to prioritize health and safety since the very start of this pandemic. In large part, he's why we've been able to save as many lives as we have saved. But, we all know Trump has been sputtering whatever guidance he feels like will benefit him on that day -- jeopardizing millions of lives across the country and contributing to the US having one of the highest death tolls in the entire world.

He's a leader in the House on all sorts of issues, from prioritizing our environment to securing economic prosperity for all Americans to protecting our children from gun violence.

President Obama just announced a list of folks across the country he's endorsing. I'm very honored to say that I was on that list. The next 90 days of this campaign will be tough and hard-fought. We're competing against an opponent who has a lot of big donors and large checks behind her. But, we're fighting on the side of just values and hardworking Orange Countians. I'm grateful that President Obama saw just how vital winning this race is and stepped in to help us uphold morality and sound decision-making in Congress.

Hi there! I'm just reaching out because our mid-month deadline is in just three days. And our campaign just received some really big news: the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican Super PAC, is spending over a million more dollars to try to flip this seat red. That's why hitting our goal is so important. It will determine if we're on pace to hit our quarter fundraising goal, which will ultimately show everyone in the district where the momentum is going in this race.

Hey -- the election is in fewer than eight weeks, and we've got some updates for you: 1\. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican Super PAC, just injected over a million dollars to this race -- almost all of which is going directly to attack ads against Harley. 2\. The NRA just endorsed Harley's opponent and gave her an "A" grade, while giving Harley an "F." That's because Harley is going to go out on a limb to protect our students and communities from gun violence, even when it means being targeted by the gun lobby and the NRA. 3\. This race is still ranked a "toss-up" by POLITICO and named the most competitive race in all of Orange County by Inside Elections. That means we need your help right now.

Thank you. Monday marked our end-of-month deadline, and, with your help, we hit our fundraising goal. That means a lot -- especially right now. Hitting our goal this month means we'll have the funds needed to reach critical voters before Election Day, including the many Orange Countians who will be voting by mail before November 3rd. It also means that we have a solid base of fundraising that we can use to compete with our special interest-backed opponent. I don't take any of this for granted.

Some of you probably saw Harley and me questioning Postmaster General Louis DeJoy about the USPS on Monday -- and you probably also saw how flummoxed he was by some of our most basic questions. Our elected and appointed officials should know their jobs inside and out -- that's what taxpayers pay us for. As one of my neighboring members, I know Harley well. And, I know that when I question him about what's happening to small business owners in Costa Mesa or how climate change is affecting our Orange County beaches or how the district is handling the coronavirus response, he knows exactly what's going on. We need to keep leaders like that in the House. That's why I'm asking if you can donate to Harley's campaign today? We're less than 70 days from Election Day, and Harley is in one of the most competitive races in the entire country.

This is where we need your help: will you sign on to our petition to urge Michelle to show up for the debate? Our elected officials are expected to debate. That's just part of the job description and why it's so surprising that in the midst of many crises and with fewer than 75 days until the election, she's remaining completely silent. Will you sign our petition to demand that Michelle agree to a debate? Thanks for signing on! \-- Alyssa, Campaign Manager Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

We are officially only ten weeks from Election Day. That means we only have a few more major fundraising deadlines before this race is decided. Monday marks one of those major deadlines: it's one of our very last end-of-month fundraising deadlines. And we really need your help if we're going to hit our goal. Can you donate today? The Republican National Convention solidified that the Party's unifying around Trump -- and we all know Michelle Steel will continue to stand in lockstep with Trump. This election could be generation-defining. We can't let Trump appointees take office and steer our country towards a Trump agenda. That's why we really need you to donate before Monday.

Hi! It's Nicole, Harley's finance director. I'm just emailing you because we need your help if we're going to hit our end of the month fundraising goal. With the election only months away, we're extremely aware that not only are we running in one of the most competitive districts in California, but we're running against one of the most well-funded campaigns in the country. That's why your help goes such a long way. Your support can help us show that we're keeping this seat blue. Can you donate today? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Harley is the only Democrat who has ever held this seat -- and he's been one of the most legislatively productive freshman members since taking office. We need to keep him in office, which means that we need to lead a grassroots charge now. Can you help us do that by donating today?

Harley and Alyssa emailed you yesterday about Michelle Steel attending an in-person fundraiser without masks. We just learned this wasn't a one-off. Just a week ago, she took a mask-less photo at a major indoor event for the right-wing leader Charlie Kirk. Check out her individual picture when he was off the main stage ⬇️ Let us be the first to tell you: jeopardizing lives for photo ops and big checks is not good leadership. Frankly, it's wrong, dangerous, and just plain selfish. We can't let someone like that take CA-48. But, the thing is: if we don't finish strong in this final week, that might just happen.

Hi there -- it's Kaira, Harley's wife. I'm just reaching out to see how your Halloween is going and tell you a little about ours. This Halloween is a bit different than years past: our kids are grown, trick-or-treaters will be sparse, and Harley's election is in just three days. But, truthfully, it feels like a scarier Halloween than any I ever remember having. There are so many things at stake for this election, both in CA-48 and across the country, and truthfully I feel scared of what will happen if people like Harley's opponent are elected. So, this Halloween, I hope you can enjoy the holiday's spookiness and also help us end the real spookiness on November 3rd by donating to Harley's campaign. Can you do that? I've seen Harley's opponent put people's lives on the line during this coronavirus crisis, and it's honestly terrifying. She's supposed to be leading our county as our top official, yet she's going to maskless events and began this pandemic implying masks could be dangerous. It's hard seeing Harley with those same fears for our district and knowing that there's a real possibility his opponent could unseat him and take her policies and beliefs to the Capitol. I want to make sure that doesn't happen. Can you help me by donating to Harley's campaign today? Thank you and happy Halloween! \-- Kaira Rouda Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Harley's win in 2018 wasn't just another part of the Blue Wave -- it was the very first time in the history of CA-48 that a Democrat won the seat. And we can't take another win for granted. Republicans are still the majority in the district, and POLITICO has rated our race a "toss-up." Hitting our fundraising goal this quarter will show that our win wasn't just an anomaly and that Harley's not going anywhere. Can you donate now to help send that message? The NRCC and Republican megadonors know just how competitive this seat is, which is why they're pouring money into our opponent's campaign. They've got one thing right: it's going to take a lot to win this race. That's why we need to come out with everything we've got. Can you donate right now to help us keep CA-48 blue?

Since the get-go, our opponent has made it crystal clear she has no interest in debating Harley -- even though that's one of the most important ways voters get to know what the candidates stand for. We're left grasping at straws why she's not giving Orange Countians a chance to see her take on some of our most pressing issues. But, Seinfeld's Jason Alexander helped moderate a "debate" between Harley and Michelle, using her previous statements about critical questions. We think it shows you just how important it is to make absolutely certain Harley's elected in five days, but we'll let you be the judge. Will you watch the clip and then donate to our campaign? Michelle Steel has spread dangerous anti-mask rhetoric, promoted homophobic views, and wants to repeal the ACA. You can even hear it for yourself in our "debate"! Let's be clear: these are bigoted, dangerous statements. And they aren't for the good of California's 48th district. They're good for the radical right and its special interest allies.

Donald Trump came to Orange County yesterday, cheering on masses of people who took to the streets to see him and hosting a high-roller fundraiser despite COVID spiraling out of control across the country. Michelle Steel, who is supposed to oversee our response to this deadly virus, was absolutely silent about the president's visit. But, this is nothing new.

That's why we need to re-elect Harley Rouda. Can you help us do that by donating today? We can't be all too surprised Michelle Steel didn't say anything about Trump's super-spreader event in Orange County. She's done this all too many times before! She was silent when Trump called our military heroes "losers," she said nothing when Trump tried to take away health care for those with pre-existing conditions, and she didn't say a thing when he said he was purposefully understating the coronavirus.

The OC Register just endorsed Harley, making him the only Democratic congressional candidate in Orange County to receive an endorsement from the newspaper! So, when we say that doesn't happen every day -- we're being very serious. Will you help Harley keep up this momentum by chipping into our campaign today? The OC Register knows that Harley is a fighter for common sense solutions, someone who will reach across the aisle to get work done, and a trusted representative of CA-48. Unlike his opponent who they thought appeared "overly reliant on GOP talking points," the Register also knows that when Harley goes to DC, he represents the needs of Orange County communities -- not just his party. That's why we're so excited to continue seeing organizations, like the Register and the US Chamber of Commerce, come down in support for Harley even when they almost exclusively endorse Republican members.

Happy Sunday, folks! This is Harley's daughter, Avery. I'm sure you already know what's at stake in this election, but this is just a gentle reminder that my dad holds one of the most competitive house seats in the whole country. That means we have to work extra hard to keep it! So, I've been helping out the campaign by calling up folks in our district all week. It can be draining at times, but there's an endless list of motivations to being engaged in politics as a young person. There is really no greater force than the force of a generation who has had enough. That's why voters, young and old, support my dad! Because they know what I know -- that my dad is right for this job. Not only because he'll continue to reach across the aisle to achieve the common goals of the American people, but also because, at his core, my dad is a man of integrity and a truly incredible father. Which honestly says it all. Can you help us re-elect my dad by donating today? With only TWO DAYS LEFT until the election, we're all a little on edge. But, with your help, I know we can win! And we will win. That's because, like my family, your family knows the importance of preserving American democracy. You all understand, like we do, how beautiful and impactful it really is when people show up and stand together to accomplish a task that serves the greatest good of the community. That's what this is really all about! So, I'm asking: can you donate to my dad's campaign today? Thank you so much for supporting my dad's campaign for Congress! \-- Avery Rouda Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Yesterday, I sent a letter to Michelle Steel's campaign team. It was a follow up to another letter we sent weeks ago asking Michelle Steel if she wanted to join Harley in a debate. Check it out >> We all know that debates are essential. They're one of the only ways that folks can get a sense of the candidate they're voting for. Yet, Michelle Steel has left our calls for a fair debate unanswered. That's not fair to Orange Countians. Will you sign our petition if you agree that the people of CA-48 have a right to watch Harley and Michelle debate? Michelle Steel has no problem attacking our campaign on social media -- but she still won't agree to a fair debate.

Michelle Steel has a lot of money on hand -- millions of dollars of it -- thanks to Big Money, the NRCC, and her own corporate salary (on top of the $1.7 million she's made off taxpayers while in office!). In fact, the NRCC is giving more money to Michelle Steel than to any other frontline challenger in the entire country. Just this quarter, they donated $200,000 dollars to her campaign. That's because Michelle Steel has shown she'll toe the party line and fall in lockstep with President Trump. We need more from our leaders. Will you donate to our re-election campaign today? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: As Harley's finance director, it's pretty difficult to see our challenger raise over $1 million in a quarter -- especially when it's clear that the NRCC is targeting this race. But, I know that we can rally back and show Michelle Steel's Big Money campaign backers that we have grassroots support on our side. Will you help us send that message by donating today?

We've tried to set up a debate between Harley and Michelle several times. We've emailed her, we've mailed her a letter, we've even used social media to try to get in touch. She still has not responded. It's clear that she's not interested in a debate, but we're still so curious why... Our elected officials are expected to speak in public and share their ideas with the people -- why the hesitation on her part? We're trying one more tactic. We're making a petition calling on her to join a debate today. Will you add your name today? With critical questions facing our country each and every day, we need leaders who are willing to fight for their opinions and policy positions.

I won't sugarcoat it -- our final FEC deadline before the election is right around the corner, and we need your help to hit our fundraising goal. Unlike Harley's opponent, our campaign isn't funded by Big Money and corporate special interests. Instead, we rely on small-dollar donations from hard working folks like you. But that also means we need your help before our final major deadline before Election Day. Can you donate $25 now to support our grassroots campaign? Our race is one of the most competitive races in the entire country. In fact, Inside Elections even named it the most competitive race in all of Orange County. Hitting our ambitious goal this quarter will show Michelle Steel and her corporate interest allies that they can't buy their way to a seat in Congress.

Today, Donald Trump and Joe Biden were set to answer the American People's questions about their presidencies in a nationally televised town hall -- that is, until, Donald Trump decided he wouldn't do it virtually.

Last week at the presidential debate, Joe Biden reminded us that we're not living with coronavirus, like Donald Trump would like us to think, we're dying with it.

Kamala Harris made history yesterday. She's the first woman of color to join the presidential ticket of a major party -- ever. And this is just the start.

Hey there! It's Nicole, Harley's finance director. With only 19 days until the election, you can bet that I'm keeping my eye on how many small dollar donations we're bringing in and how many big checks our opponent is raking in. So, when I got the FEC notification just minutes ago that Michelle Steel's Q3 numbers were in and saw that she's given herself 1.7 million dollars over the course of this campaign, you can imagine just how motivated I became to show her that we can still beat her with our small dollar donors. But, that's why I've got to ask you: can you pitch in just a few dollars to our campaign right now? Yeah -- you read that right. She's given herself 1.7 million dollars. So, I really mean it when I say that we need every single one of you to pitch in something to help us meet a massive haul like that. Can you help us get there by donating today?

This weekend marks 100 days until Election Day!!! To celebrate, we'll be having a Day of Action on Saturday, calling voters to share Harley's message, and a special fundraising push to show Michelle Steel and her Big Money allies that we're ready for November. Can you help us get ready for November by signing up for our very special Day of Action or by helping us meet our fundraising deadline before the end of the weekend? It's go-time. Especially after hearing that Michelle Steel raised over $1 million last quarter, we know that we have an uphill battle ahead of us. In these next 100 days, we need to reach every voter we can and raise every dollar we can. But, we need your help to do that. Can you donate before the end of the weekend or sign up to join our Day of Action to help us meet our ambitious goals before Sunday night? Thank you!!! \-- Harley's Virtual "Field" Team Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Michelle Steel announced that she brought in over $1 million dollars last quarter -- including a check she wrote to herself for $500,000. It's hard to compete with someone who's got Big Money in her corner and who'll write herself a check to boost her fundraising numbers.

We got news last week that the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican-backing Super PAC, is throwing $600,000 behind Michelle Steel TV ads. That's just the latest Republican attempt to buy this seat back with major cash injections. We all know how close this race is. Every single dollar poured into this race is a dollar that could win or lose this election. Can you chip in just a few dollars to help us match our opponent's massive hauls and keep this seat blue? Our race is literally one of the most competitive races in the country. POLITICO has ranked our race a "toss-up" and Inside Elections named it the toughest race for Dems to win in Orange County. Not to mention, Republicans are flooding the race with Big Money and are about to storm the district with Michelle Steel ads. So, when we say this time is urgent, we really mean it. Can you donate to our campaign today? We can't tell you how much we appreciate your support! \-- Rouda HQ Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

But, somehow, our opponent, who is also the top official in Orange County, just decided to attend an indoor, mask-less fundraiser?!

Hi there, I'm just following up on Nicole's email from the other day about Michelle Steel giving her campaign $1.7 million dollars. Turns out, she's not the only deep-pocketed donor funding her campaign. We just learned that the NRA, the anti-choice Susan B. Anthony Candidate Fund, and the Trump-backing billionaires Sheldon and Meriam Adelson have all given her campaign thousands of dollars. And, because I'm not taking a dime from corporate Super PACs, I'm counting on grassroots donors just like you to donate to our campaign. Can you do that? Thank you so much! \-- Harley \---------- Forwarded message --------- Hey there! It's Nicole, Harley's finance director. With only 19 days until the election, you can bet that I'm keeping my eye on how many small dollar donations we're bringing in and how many big checks our opponent is raking in. So, when I got the FEC notification just minutes ago that Michelle Steel's Q3 numbers were in and saw that she's given herself 1.7 million dollars over the course of this campaign, you can imagine just how motivated I became to show her that we can still beat her with our small dollar donors. But, that's why I've got to ask you: can you pitch in just a few dollars to our campaign right now? Yeah -- you read that right. She's given herself 1.7 million dollars. So, I really mean it when I say that we need every single one of you to pitch in something to help us meet a massive haul like that. Can you help us get there by donating today? Thanks for being part of our grassroots team! \-- Nicole LeClerc, Finance Director Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Harley sent out an email yesterday about the profound repercussions of Trump's attacks against the USPS. In it, he swore that he'd protect USPS and our democracy -- no matter what lies Trump and his administration spew. We've forwarded it below for context! He's already making good on his word. Today, our campaign joined leaders in a safe rally in support of the USPS (check out Harley speaking at it below!). Harley will always stand for what's right and try to make good on his word -- that's what made him the most productive freshman member and why we need him in Congress. Will you donate now to help us keep him there? Thank you!!! \-- Rouda HQ \---------- Forwarded message --------- President Trump openly admitted to blocking USPS funding to stop Americans from voting safely and securely. Let me repeat: the President of the United States of America publicly confirmed that he is actively sabotaging our right to a free and fair election. This is bigger than petty partisan politics; it is an attack on the foundation of our nation. This is a war waged on the bedrock principles of our republic -- the right to use your vote to make your voice heard and hold elected officials accountable. This is a "where were you and what did you do to stop it" moment in history. With the election right around the corner, I need your help to keep defending our democracy. Can you give now? I'll keep doing everything I can to protect our elections, including questioning Postmaster General DeJoy, supporting efforts to preserve USPS, and sounding the alarm -- but I need your help. The Trump Administration and complicit Republican members of Congress have sought to undermine our democracy -- but we need to show them that the power still rests with the people. Can you help me do that by chipping in to our grassroots campaign and allowing me to bring the voice of hardworking, everyday Orange Countians to Congress?

Last night, Harley debated... an empty chair. You heard that right. He went to debate his opponent, and she never showed -- calling the debate biased because a local Democratic group wanted to have a watch party of the event. The truth is: Michelle Steel has been ignoring attempts to hold a debate for weeks. From our standpoint, she was just looking for an "out" from this event. We need leaders who will be accountable to voters by actually engaging in thoughtful, fair debates before the election. Will you donate right now to help us elect Harley? Harley's in Congress because he wants to include your voice in our country's most important issues. And, he knows that one of the best ways to show you that he'll do that is through a live, moderated, and fair debate with his opponent.

Hi there -- I just wanted to reach out to let you know that our end-of-quarter fundraising deadline is tomorrow, and we need your help if we're going to reach our goal. The truth is: this is the most important fundraising deadline we've had yet in this campaign. With only 35 days left until Election Day, this is one of the final indicators of where we stand in this race and will dictate just how much we can spend to reach undecided folks before voting ends. That really matters right now. In fact, getting Harley's message across to enough Independent voters is the only way we can win this race. Can you help us do that by donating right now? You can help us win this race! \-- Nicole LeClerc, Finance Director Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress. In 2018, Harley defeated the 15-term incumbent Dana Rohrabacher in the very first political campaign of Harley's life. During his time in Congress, he's embraced common sense and values to tackle climate change, address deteriorating infrastructure, confront homelessness, and protect Social Security and Medicare. In 2020, Harley will be facing one of the toughest re-election fights in the entire country, so he's depending on the support of grassroots individuals.

Our end-of-month fundraising deadline is in just hours. With mail-in ballots being delivered in just over a month, hitting our goal this month will be a huge part of determining how many people we can reach with Harley's message before they return their ballots. Hitting our August fundraising goal is critical since all of Orange County will be able to vote by mail this year instead of going to packed polling places on Election Day. So, can you donate right now to our campaign? This election is one of the most competitive races in the entire country. Period. POLITICO has called our race a "toss-up" and Inside Elections thinks it's the most competitive race in Orange County. That means we have just over a month to convince enough Orange County voters to mail in their ballots for Harley -- and it won't necessarily be easy. That's why we really need you to donate to our campaign before midnight. Can you do that?

Did you see Katie Porter's email about Harley yesterday? Check it out below! Katie and Harley teamed up to make sure Postmaster General DeJoy was up to the job -- and he didn't even know some of the most basic elements of the USPS. If anyone knows how to ask tough questions, it's Katie Porter. And, the truth is, Harley will always be ready for the hard questions. As a member of Congress, it's exactly what he expects. But, he's also in one of the toughest re-election races in the entire country, which is why he really needs your help. Can you chip in a few dollars to keep him in Congress? Thank you! \-- Alyssa, Campaign Manager \---------- Forwarded message --------- Some of you probably saw Harley and me questioning Postmaster General Louis DeJoy about the USPS on Monday -- and you probably also saw how flummoxed he was by some of our most basic questions. Our elected and appointed officials should know their jobs inside and out -- that's what taxpayers pay us for. As one of my neighboring members, I know Harley well. And, I know that when I question him about what's happening to small business owners in Costa Mesa or how climate change is affecting our Orange County beaches or how the district is handling the coronavirus response, he knows exactly what's going on. We need to keep leaders like that in the House. That's why I'm asking if you can donate to Harley's campaign today? We're less than 70 days from Election Day, and Harley is in one of the most competitive races in the entire country. That's why I have to ask if you'll help Harley hit his end-of-month fundraising goal before Monday. Can you donate today?

Hey -- we've got some exciting news: we've just released our newest TV ad! In our ad, you'll get to hear Harley's confession -- and the thing is, he's actually pretty darn proud of it.

Hey there -- I just wanted to see if you saw Alyssa's email from yesterday (forwarded below). I've been asking my opponent to join me for a debate for weeks now, and she hasn't said anything about it. Debates are a critical way for voters to see where candidates stand on issues and how they differ from each other. And debates don't end with the campaign -- they're a major part of my duties on Capitol Hill. That's why I'm shocked that my opponent won't even acknowledge our request -- and we can be pretty sure that she's gotten the message. Can you join me in calling on Michelle to join us for a debate? Thank you! \-- Harley \---------- Forwarded message --------- Harley's asked his opponent for a debate. In several different ways. And multiple times. Her campaign still hasn't said a thing about it. We sent another letter to her team today letting them know that Harley's going to be available on August 30th at 6pm in Newport Beach for a debate -- whether or not she decides to actually come debate him. This is where we need your help: will you sign on to our petition to urge Michelle to show up for the debate? Our elected officials are expected to debate. That's just part of the job description and why it's so surprising that in the midst of many crises and with fewer than 75 days until the election, she's remaining completely silent.

Hi there, Throughout Orange County and the nation, the effects of the coronavirus have rattled our communities and revolutionized our conception of work. For some folks, that's meant responding to life-threatening emergencies every single day. For others, it's been teaching students over Zoom for the first time ever. And, for a lot of folks, that's meant being laid off and forced to search for work in a time of global economic uncertainty. In this context, Labor Day has a powerful and distinct meaning. It's understanding the role of labor in the context of our own lives, as well as its role in our communities. So, I hope you also put aside some time today to reflect upon how this pandemic has affected the jobs and livelihoods of people across our county and our nation. And, I also hope you spend some of your time enjoying the holiday and safely cooling off from the heat. Happy Labor Day! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hey -- it's Alyssa, Harley's campaign manager. I'm reaching out because Harley's on his way to meet Michelle for their debate. However, it's unlikely she'll even turn up. We want to show Harley that, even though his opponent is refusing to engage, we still think he's doing the right thing by trying to facilitate a debate. That's why we're going to try to flood him with donations for the rest of the night -- it'll be the perfect way to show him that we support his effort and to help us reach our end-of-month fundraising goal. Will you donate right now to our campaign? Harley's opponent is doing everything she can to get out of debating Harley. She even just tried to blame her absence on the fact that a local Democratic group is going to be watching the debate. We've already told her that we're trying to make this as fair as possible, but she won't even engage the possibility of a debate.

I'm with Harley: I'm nervous, folks. It's Election Day, and we know we're in for a race that won't be quickly decided. Just like the New York Times, the LA Times, and The Independent, Harley and I both know that this race is going to be as close as it gets. But, rather than twiddling our thumbs waiting on the results, we're going to keep on fighting to make sure we can keep reaching voters and hitting our budget goals. That's why I'm asking: can you donate $10 right now? Happy Election Day! \-- Alyssa Napuri, Campaign Manager \---------- Forwarded message --------- I've always known this is going to be a competitive race. No matter how long I'm in Congress, it will probably always be competitive -- because this is just a tough district to win in for a Democrat. But, newspapers all over the place, from the LA Times to the New York Times to even The Independent in the UK, are now reiterating that we're in for a nail-biter. So, I'm nervous. Especially because this race has huge consequences for people in Orange County and across the country. Can you help me secure two more years in Washington by donating today? We've got a lot on the line this election. Fundamental rights and basic safety could be stripped away if my opponent wins this race. So, I'm coming to you now, the day before Election Day, to ask if you can donate $20 to my re-election campaign. Can you donate today?

Team, With only 74 days left until the general election, we can’t waste another second. Josh is working every day to ensure the residents of NJ-5 have a strong voice in Congress. This year, NJ-5 has two choices: either we re-elect Josh — a family-focused problem solver who stands up for our values — or we’re stuck with “Fraudster Frank” Pallotta, a man who made his fortune preying on families in our community. It’s go time. Josh is fighting for us every day on the House floor, and he needs our help. We need to raise $5,000 by the end of this weekend to make sure our campaign has the resources to take on “Fraudster Frank”. Can you chip in? If you've stored your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will process immediately. CHIP IN $20 » CHIP IN $50 » CHIP IN $100 » CHIP IN $250 » CHIP IN OTHER » The election is closer than we think. To beat back the extremist hand-picked by the NRCC, we can’t let up now. In 2016, Josh won this seat from an ineffective politician for us. If we want to keep our representative working for us, we can’t be complacent. Josh is the fighter we need. He’s willing to work across the aisle and create common sense solutions. His leadership is what we need in Washington, not politicians using ideological differences as an excuse for lack of progress.

Two good rules of thumb: 1\. Don't use speakerphone when you're in a restaurant. We've all seen that guy... he's the worst. 2\. Don't use speakerphone when you're in a restaurant and talking to the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES! Inhofe, the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, not only took a call from Trump in public but he allowed everyone in the room to listen in on their conversation. This is an obvious threat to our national security. Infohe's lack of common sense proves he is dangerously unfit for office. Will you help Abby beat Inhofe by chipping in before tomorrow's deadline? We need this national security risk out of office ASAP! Thank you, Team Abby Abby is an award-winning journalist and attorney. She has spent her career fighting to ensure people’s voices are heard and powerful people are held accountable. As a lifelong Oklahoman, Abby is tired of Senator Inhofe’s failed leadership. She is running for the United States Senate to bring change to Washington. We understand that this is a challenging time for so many folks in Oklahoma right now.

Alex, Last Friday marked two years since the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida — the deadliest school shooting in our country's history. In addition to holding the families who lost their loved ones close to our hearts this past week—as well as the brave young survivors of the tragedy—we were again reminded of the stakes at play while we look for common sense ways to prevent these horrific crimes: the lives of America's children. So, today, I want to focus on safe storage of guns. This is something that just makes good common sense. Guns, after all, are deadly weapons and should be treated as such — and kept secure. This is all the more important given what we know about the gun violence epidemic in our country. It is, sadly, being fueled in part by accidents and missteps by lawful gun owners. Hundreds of thousands of unsecured guns are stolen every year, and many more wind up in the hands of family, friends, and —- yes — children. Consider the shooting at Clackamas Town Center in 2012. We may never know what motivated the gunman to open fire, killing two shoppers — Cynthia Yuille and Steven Forsythe — and himself. But we do know he was easily able to steal the rifle and ammunition he used from a friend, and that neither was secure. The friend didn't initially report to police that his weapon had been stolen. He wasn't required to. As things currently stand, we have no laws in Oregon requiring safe gun storage, nor any requirement for gun owners to report a missing weapon. Action on gun safety is long overdue, Alex, as the family members of Forsythe and Yuille, who have fought for change for years, can attest. Now we have a shot at progress. I'm proud to support a bill that would require gun owners to safely store firearms and report missing weapons. I testified on behalf of the bill, as did Steve Forsythe's brother-in-law.

Amarillo police officers can always count on Elaine Hays to have their back. She will take common sense and Texas grit to Congress. Combining her financial experience with her strong conservative West Texas values, Elaine Hays will work tirelessly to represent all Texans in Washington.” Hays responded, “Being endorsed by the brave men and women of the Amarillo Police Officers Association is an absolute honor. They put their lives on the line to protect our communities and families. I will continue to work hard on their behalf. I am grateful to the APOA for their support.” Hays has roots throughout the 13th district. She grew up in Bridgeport, Texas, and has lived in Amarillo since 1985. Hays is a mother of four and has four grandchildren. She is a small businesswoman, a triathlete, and a former collegiate basketball player.

Dear Friend, Yesterday I received an interesting mailer from one of my opponents in the June 23rd Republican primary. Have you ever seen such beautiful mountains in Hampton Roads? No? That’s because these mountains are nowhere near Virginia’s Second District. This is a picture of the Shenandoah Valley, hundreds of miles away. Why is Scott Taylor using pictures for his campaign for Congress in the Second District that are from nowhere near the Second District? Because this picture is from his short-lived U.S. Senate campaign. Before Scott Taylor decided to make another run for the seat he already lost in 2018 due to self-inflicted wounds, he campaigned across the Commonwealth for U.S. Senate, taking contributions from Virginians all across the state who thought their money would be put to defeating Mark Warner. Instead, whether because he no longer saw that race as winnable or because he planned to flip all along, Scott Taylor switched horses midstream and started to campaign for the House again. I’ve spent the last five months campaigning across the Second Congressional District because I truly want to serve and represent this District. I’ve been to all nine cities and counties of the Second District multiple times. I’ve met with small business owners, sportsmen, fishermen, pastors, veterans, College Republicans, Young Republicans, Republican Women’s Clubs, Hispanic groups, Filipino communities, and so many others across this great and diverse District. I am honored to have been endorsed by more than 40 past and present elected officials across Hampton Roads, including former Congressmen Scott Rigell and Randy Forbes, former Senator Jeff McWaters, Senators Bill DeSteph and John Cosgrove, Delegate Glenn Davis, former Delegate Brenda Pogge, the Mayors of Cape Charles and Cheriton, four sitting Accomack and Northampton County Supervisors, and so many others. Six out of eight Republican unit Chairmen in the Second District support my candidacy (the other two are neutral). The grassroots are energized as well- we have activated hundreds of volunteers and are delivering hundreds of newly requested yard signs every week. This level of support in a contested primary is simply unheard of. Republicans from every wing of the party and every part of the Second District are uniting behind my candidacy because they know I am the only Republican candidate who can defeat Elaine Luria. Friends, I am tired of politicians who care more about politics than representing those they were elected to serve. We need leaders who are less concerned with being someone than actually doing something. My entire career has been about working hard to deliver results. I am running for Congress so I can continue to serve my country and our community. With just two months to go, the momentum is on our side and we are firing on all cylinders. But, as you know, campaigns cost money. Please consider making a contribution to fund our efforts today. Any amount, big or small, goes a long way to help us ensure our message of principled conservative leadership continues to reach voters across the Second District. To make a contribution to my campaign go to [[URL REDACTED]] As always, thank you so much for your ongoing support. Together, we will defeat Elaine Luria, regain the House majority, and bring common sense back to Washington.

Friends, Now that the dust has settled and I have had time to reflect and spend some time with my family, I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who had helped us on this journey. This campaign was not outworked. Our incredible team of volunteers knocked more than 20,000 doors and made over 50,000 calls to voters all across the Second District. We did 20 joint virtual town halls with elected officials and local leaders in the span of two months. We fought hard to earn every vote. Our message of common sense conservative principles resonated with voters across our communities. Although we came short, I have no regrets about my decision to run and am deeply humbled by all the support I have received. With the primary behind us, it is imperative that we unite and defeat Elaine Luria in November. We gave it our all and then some. My team and I still have a few bills left to pay from this very expensive race. Please consider making one final contribution to help us close the books on this hard-fought campaign. You may CLICK HERE to donate. As always, thank you for all your support. This is the greatest country in the world and I’ve been blessed to live the American Dream.

To safely restart businesses, Congress must act You're receiving this email because of your participation with Mike Bloomberg 2020. We'll be sending you updates like this on initiatives and issues we think you'll be interested in. Thank you! Bloomberg Philanthropies COVID-19 Response Friend, As more places move to reopen their economies, we need Congress to do more to protect workers. We know that workplaces are potential hotbeds for infection. Thousands of American health care workers have come down with COVID-19, and nearly 200 meat processing plants have had outbreaks, infecting 11,500 people. Cashiers and others have been hard hit, too. It's essential that companies take action to protect their employees, and that they have clear guidance and support on how to do so. For that to happen all across the country, we need Congress to act. This week I wrote about how Congress can spur businesses to protect workers, and you can read about it here: [[URL REDACTED]] To enable American businesses to survive, hire employees, and get our economy moving again, we need common sense measures to protect American workers.

Dear friend, I want you to meet my good friend Lindsey. Lindsey Simmons is a young mother, accomplished lawyer, and lifelong Missourian running to unseat Vicky Hartzler in Missouri’s 4th District. She has a beautiful 1-year-old son named Jace, and her husband Chris is an Apache helicopter pilot currently serving in the U.S. Army. If elected, she would become the first active duty military spouse in Congress. We often hear that running in a state like Missouri, or at least running in the more rural parts of the state, is “difficult” or “courageous.” But what people should understand is that it is never wrong to choose to engage with your community, the place you call home, the place you grew up in, and try to make it better. We can’t turn our backs on the people and places that made us who we are today. Lindsey and I are running because we care deeply about our hometowns, and our state. Because it pains us to see our neighbors struggling more and more year after year with no relief in sight. Because folks in our small towns and our rural counties have come to expect the worst from our government. And because politics should be about people coming together and voices being heard in order to solve real problems—not partisan disagreements and cheap punditry. The system doesn’t have to work (or not work) this way. We need more people like Lindsey to stand up, to say “enough” and to fight for a practical, common sense, and solutions-oriented government once again. I invite you to get to know Lindsey, to listen to her story, and to consider whether her constituents would be better off with someone like her representing them. I believe that Lindsey is a fantastic candidate with a fresh voice that our country so desperately needs right now. If you agree, please consider splitting a contribution between Lindsey’s campaign and my campaign: [[URL REDACTED]] Be sure to also find Lindsey on Facebook and Twitter, and share her message with your friends and family.

Campaign Update View this email in your browser Dear Friends, As we walked door-to-door this weekend, the common theme we consistently heard is the notion of wanting balance in Hartford and a bipartisan approach when it comes to decision making. People want their elected leaders to be responsive and proactive. There is a great deal of energy and excitement for our message that is grounded in accountability and common sense. But with two weeks to go before the special election on Jan. 14, we still need your help and time. To kick off 2020 and the new decade, we will be going door-to-door on New Year's Day from Noon to 4 p.m. (Please meet at 200 Mill Plain Road). Lawn signs are going quick -- if you have a location for us, please let us know and we will drop it off. Thank you again for your support, energy and friendship.

Friend: This past Wednesday, I attended a subject matter hearing on the "Development for All" ordinance led by the Housing Committee. While I am not a member of the Housing Committee, I felt it important to attend this hearing as the Development for All Ordinance aims to create balanced development and investment in housing by ensuring the inclusion of affordable housing for working families in all 50 wards. In our ward and throughout the city, we have seen the impact of developer greed and loopholes to the existing Affordable Requirements Ordinance (ARO). These loopholes have led to a glut of luxury developments and skyrocketing rents. The Development for All Ordinance would strengthen affordable housing requirements for new developments by: * Ending fatal loopholes in the existing Affordable Requirements Ordinance (ARO) that have undermined the production of affordable housing in high-rent and gentrifying areas; * Put a stop to the common practice of developer's "opting out" of affordable housing and paying an "in lieu of fee" instead; * Raise the floor to establish a new 30% set-aside requirement of new units when a developer seeks upzoning approval from the City to build in high-rent and gentrifying census tracts, and a floor of 20% in moderate-rent census tracts; * Drop the rent of an "affordable" apartment down to what working families and seniors can truly afford by establishing a new tiered rent structure for the required affordable units that caps rents for set-aside apartments at between $250-$970 for a 3-bedroom apartment and mandates the production of family-sized affordable housing units (e.g., 3 bedrooms). If enacted, the Development for all Ordinance would make equitable and accessible housing a priority for our city and diminish the amount of rent-burdened families in our ward. Lack of affordable rents are a common concern we hear from our residents at the ward office, it is why we have worked to support and implement 100% affordable developments like the 44-unit Independence Library senior housing in Irving Park, the 45-unit OSO Apartments on Montrose and Bernard in Albany Park, and the forthcoming 100-unit affordable housing development on Emmett Street in Logan Square. We know housing is a human right, and that is why we must continue to fight for affordable housing and ordinances like Development for All. Tomorrow morning I will join neighborhood groups and residents at their 7th annual "Las Posadas" event. Las Posadas is Spanish for lodging, and this traditional Latin American event is a community celebration that reenacts Joseph and Mary's search for lodging prior to Jesus' birth. Tomorrow's Las Posadas will be dedicated to our community's fight for affordable housing. Join us tomorrow morning at the centennial monument at 10 am followed by a march to Emmet Street. I hope to see you at Las Posadas! Warm regards, Carlos ## * * * * * * ### The 2020 Shared Cost Sidewalk Program will open to new applicants starting at 6 a.m. on January 7, 2020 and conclude at 5:59 a.m. on January 8, 2020. The Shared Cost Sidewalk Program is an extremely popular voluntary program in which property owners share the cost of sidewalk repair with the City. Thousands of Chicagoans have been a part of this popular program, taking advantage of the low cost, exceptional value, and ease of participation. The Shared Cost Sidewalk Program cost per square foot charged to property owners is well below what a private contractor would charge. Senior citizens and persons with disabilities may qualify for a further discounted rate. Applications will be taken on a first-come, first-served basis. The number of participants is based on the availability of funds. The program typically reaches capacity quickly, so you are encouraged to apply early. Please note that if you applied for the program in previous years, you must apply again in 2020 if you wish to be considered for the 2020 program. Applications will only be accepted through the City’s 311 system by calling 311 or through the City’s service request website [[URL REDACTED]] The property owner’s contact information and the property address are required at the time of the request. * * * ### Chiqueolatte to open in Logan Square at 2643 N Milwaukee Ave Coming soon to Logan Square, Chiqueolatte is a Chocolate cafe with roots in Luxembourg and the Netherlands. We are excited to welcome a new business to the 35th Ward! To get a taste for what's expected at Chiqueolatte, visit their website at [[URL REDACTED]] You may also read about the development at Block Club Chicago at this link: Chocolate Cafe With Roots In Luxembourg And The Netherlands Opening First U.S. Location In Logan Square. * * * ### Ethics Committee passes ban on elected officials working as lobbyists Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa is a member of the Chicago City Council's Ethics Committee. This week the committee passed an ordinance co-sponsored by Alderman Ramirez-Rosa that bans elected officials from working as lobbyists in the City of Chicago. This means Chicago Aldermen will no longer be able to work as lobbyists, and any elected official at the state or county level or other unit of government will not be able to lobby the City of Chicago. This is a common sense ethics reform that Alderman Ramirez-Rosa was proud to co-sponsor and support in committee. Scroll down to the "35th Ward & City News" section of the newsletter to read more about this ordinance that goes to the full City Council next week. * * * ## THE MIRACLE CENTER’S Youth Theater Ensemble presents Cinderella The timeless enchantment of a magical fairy tale is reborn with the Rodgers & Hammerstein hallmarks of originality, charm and elegance. Originally presented on television in 1957 starring Julie Andrews, Rodgers & Hammerstein's CINDERELLA was the most widely viewed program in the history of the medium. Its recreation in 1965 starring Lesley Ann Warren was no less successful in transporting a new generation to the miraculous kingdom of dreams-come-true, and so was a second remake in 1997, which starred Brandy as Cinderella and Whitney Houston as her Fairy Godmother. As adapted for the stage, with great warmth and more than a touch of hilarity, the hearts of children and adults alike still soar when the slipper fits. Event Details: The play is at The Miracle Center located at 2311 N. Pulaski Rd. We recommend that you arrive at least 30 minutes prior to the performance/event to find parking, have a drink and/or an appetizer at our reception, and locate your seat before the show begins. Please account for traffic on your way to the theatre) Tickets are $20 or $15 for students with an ID ## * * * * * * ## Pedestrian Safety Improvements in the 35th Ward Over the summer and fall of this year, my office has worked with the Chicago Department of Transportation to improve pedestrian and traffic safety in the 35th Ward by adding "In-Road Pedestrian Crossing" signs on busy intersections in Albany Park, Avondale, Irving Park, and Logan Square. To date, the 35th Ward Office has installed 16 "In-Road Pedestrian Crossing" signs at the locations listed below. With winter weather approaching, replacements and new signs will not be implemented until the Spring of next year, as the signs may be damaged by the city's snow plows. My office will continue to work alongside the Chicago Department of Transportation and residents alike to identify locations in need of "In-Road Pedestrian Crossing" signs, if you know an intersection that can use some added pedestrian safety measures, please feel free to contact my office. * Milwaukee and Sawyer * Milwaukee and Spaulding * Milwaukee and Dawson * Milwaukee and Gresham * Milwaukee and Wisner * Milwaukee and Drake * Central Park and Wolfram * Central Park and George * Montrose and Lawndale * Montrose and Ridgeway * Montrose and Bernard requested * Lawrence and Monticello * Lawrence and Lawndale * Lawrence and Springfield * Kimball and Drummond * Kimball and Parker * * * ## * * * ## Participatory Budgeting Update Every year, each Alderman receives $1.3 million for ward infrastructure improvements, this funding is known as "Aldermanic menu money." This is the sole source of funding made available to Aldermen to repave streets, resurface alleys, and make critically needed infrastructure repairs (the "menu" of infrastructure improvement options). In the 35th Ward, since 2015, we have empowered residents to decide how to spend $1 million of our Aldermanic menu money – whether it be fixing specific curbs, repaving certain streets, or installing bike lanes – through participatory budgeting (PB). Our 2020 Participatory Budgeting (PB) cycle came to a close last week and on Wednesday members of our PB Committee tallied all online and paper ballots. I want to thank all of our PB committee members that worked alongside my office to investigate the 117 infrastructure ideas submitted to my office and helped to collect votes via door knocking and polling at community events. I would also like to thank Mozart Park, Unity Park Advisory Council, Independence Park and the Chicago Park District for allowing us to collect votes on location for Hermosa Halloween, Pumpkin Fest, and the Independence Park Farmer's Market. The winners of our 35th Ward 2020 PB cycle are: * Alley Resurfacing for a total of $700,000 in public funding towards alleys in Albany Park, Hermosa, Avondale, and Logan Square * Sidewalk Repairs with a total of $300,000 in public funding towards sidewalk repairs in Avondale and Logan Square at the following locations: * Barry Between Sawyer North Side Sidewalk * 3300 N. Drake, West Sidewalk * 2300 N. Hamlin, East Side Sidewalk * 3300 W. Altgeld, North Side Sidewalk Our office will work with the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) and our PB committee to submit projects to CDOT in January for construction estimates and surveys. The final cost of the projects will determine how many projects we will be able to fund this year. In determining costs for projects my office utilized a 2019 base estimate provided by CDOT, but the actual price for projects will be determined after they are formally surveyed by CDOT engineers. Furthermore, CDOT determines the timeline for implementation based on their crews and work planned by utility companies. Construction can begin as early as April or as late as November. My office will post infrastructure updates on our PB webpage. As a reminder, routine infrastructure repairs - like fixing street lamps or filling potholes - are not part of the PB process. Reach out to our office to request any of these routine city services. Additionally, speed humps are not part of our PB process. To request street or alley speed humps simply download the petition at [[URL REDACTED]] and submit the signatures to the office. Thank you again to all those who participated in our 2020 PB cycle whether it was attending one of our Idea Collections in the early Fall, joining our PB committee, or casting their vote online or at our various polling locations.

To report faded markings, please call (773) 887-3772, email [[URL REDACTED]] or text (773) 985-3510. * * * ## Recycling Pick-up Recycling and garbage pickup was heavily interrupted due to extreme weather conditions. Many of the trucks were deemed inoperable due to the cold, this resulted in missed pickups for many sections. Laborers are working to discard missed pickups and should be back on regular schedule next week. Our office is working closely with the Department of Streets and Sanitation to monitor missed picks and collect refuse. In July 2011 Mayor Rahm Emanuel privatized recycling services and awarded contracts to garbage companies such as Waste Management, Inc take over half of Chicago's curbside recycling services. In my time representing the 35th Ward, my office has received complaints regarding missed recycling pick-up services on a near-weekly basis. The privatization of public services has proven to be a failure in the City of Chicago at the cost of residents and tax-payer dollars. Please reach out to my office if your home or block has not received recycling services on your scheduled pickup date. Find out your recycling schedule here: Recycling & Garbage Pickup Schedule * * * ## 35th Ward CAPS Meetings Alderman Ramirez-Rosa believes that strengthening partnerships between city departments, local elected officials, community organizations, the Chicago Police Department, and local neighbors is critical to a successful public safety strategy.

# In a moment, we’re going to ask you to contribute to our campaign, but first, we want to tell you a little bit about Henry and his career dedicated to public service. Henry and his seven siblings were born in Laredo, Texas to migrant workers who raised them with strong family values and an unwavering work ethic. They taught their kids to be disciplined, study hard and succeed at school. Instilled with the values of hard work and education, Henry worked his way through college washing dishes and went on to become the most degreed member of Congress. He has firsthand knowledge of what it means to struggle and what it takes to earn a decent living, and the opportunities that should be accessible to everyone not just to live, but to thrive. Henry’s values are reflected in his priorities as a member of Congress that puts the families he represents first. He dedicatedly works to: * Expand access to quality health care * Lower prescription drug prices * Protect local jobs * Ensure taxes are spent responsibly and benefit taxpayers directly * Support our local public schools * Enhance Social Security and retirement programs As a senior, respected member of Congress and the Appropriations Committee, Henry has delivered tens of millions in funding to address local and national priorities and set the example for other districts across the country. Henry is a proud Democrat who has established a reputation for bringing common sense to Congress and doesn’t allow partisan differences to stand in the way of passing legislation that benefits everyday Americans. We need to keep strong, compassionate and unwavering leaders like Henry in Congress to represent the needs of our communities. Early voting in Texas starts in less than three weeks. So, will you chip in to our campaign to ensure that Henry is reelected and can continue to serve and put people first?

Burning up our natural resources makes no business sense. Chrysta Castañeda for Texas Railroad Commission Rio Grande Guardian: Texas is flaring enough natural gas to power Houston CHRYSTA KNOWS WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED CHIP IN NOW TO GET THE RAILROAD COMMISSION BACK ON TRACK Friend, If you had to take a guess, how much natural gas do you think is burned off in flaring right now in Texas? Answer: Enough to power Houston. Natural gas is a booming industry in our country and in the Permian here in Texas. But instead of capitalizing on our precious natural resource, the Texas Railroad Commission is letting it go up in smoke. By allowing the flaring of enough natural gas to power Houston, the Railroad Commission is neglecting its main duty: to prevent the waste of our natural resources. Allowing this much waste is not only illegal, but it also makes no economic sense. That's why I'm stepping up to get the Texas Railroad Commission back on track and working for us again. But if we're going to fix it, I'm going to need your help. Help me power-up my campaign so I can get the Texas Railroad Commission back on track. Chip in $10 or more now to help me keep going. If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: $10 » $25 » $50 » $75 » $100 » Other » For over a decade, the Texas Railroad Commission has handed out flaring permits without thinking twice about how that undercuts our state. When we could be turning that natural gas into electricity, it's like setting money on fire. We need to get the Railroad Commission back on track. With my 35 years of experience, I know I'm the one to get the job done. Are you with me? Chip in $10 or more now today so that I can bring some common sense back to our Texas Railroad Commission. Thanks for your help, Chrysta Castañeda * * * Chrysta Castañeda is an engineer, attorney, and mother running for the Texas Railroad Commission, our state's oil and gas regulatory agency. With over thirty years of experience in and around the industry, she's ready to step up and be the advocate Texans need to protect our health and environment.

We all know who we look to when we want coronavirus guidance. Spoiler alert: it's usually not our president. Anthony Fauci has been our most reliable source of guidance on how to fight this pandemic since day one. And, we can't let Trump shuffle blame to him just to save face. Can you sign on to show Dr. Fauci that you're supporting him? Dr. Fauci has made sure to prioritize health and safety since the very start of this pandemic. In large part, he's why we've been able to save as many lives as we have saved. But, we all know Trump has been sputtering whatever guidance he feels like will benefit him on that day -- jeopardizing millions of lives across the country and contributing to the US having one of the highest death tolls in the entire world. We need to show Fauci he has our support. Can you do that by signing on today? Thank you for taking part! \-- Team Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hi there. June is our second to last chance to post the kind of end of quarter numbers that will silence the NRCC once and for all. A new rating just showed that our race is the most competitive in all of Orange County. That's a sign to the NRCC that they should jump straight into our race and try everything they can to flip it red. Our best bet to fend off these attacks is to post record high end of quarter fundraising numbers. Will you help us do that by donating to our campaign today? I'm just going to say it bluntly: we need a huge fundraising showing this June. With the election just months away, hitting our target this end of quarter is non-negotiable. That's what will show the NRCC and the massive special interests that we're not going anywhere. Can you donate now to help us reach our ambitious June fundraising goal?

Hi! It's Nicole, Harley's Finance Director. I'm reaching out with an important update about our primary election. Harley's challengers are building up their war chests with massive donations from corporate special interests, large self-written checks, and -- oh yeah -- giant contributions from every member of the DeVos family. We're never going to accept money from people or organizations who are so starkly in conflict with the values we hold most sacred. That's why we rely on normal, everyday people, like you. Will you donate now to show Harley's challengers that we're running a campaign beholden to the people? The DeVos family is connected to just about every major right-wing organization and have been firm backers of Trump's family separation policy, Brett Kavanaugh's appointment, and a host of anti-LGBTQ policies. The fact that people like that are giving max contributions to one of Harley's challengers is an indictment of her character and who she is as a candidate. Will you donate to our value-driven campaign? Thank you! \-- Nicole LeClerc Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

There are officially 100 days until our election is decided. As Harley's finance director, I know that we'll have to increase fundraising every single one of these 100 days until Election Day. That's a big challenge, but with such a strong team of grassroots supporters on our side, I know we can do it. The first step is to hit our "100 Days Out" fundraising goal. Can you help us meet our goal by donating today? We know that Michelle Steel is going to continue taking in huge checks from corporate special interests and the NRCC. That's why coming out each and every month with huge grassroots fundraising numbers is one of the only ways we can compete with Michelle Steel's hefty war chest.

November will bring critical elections at every level of government, including our election here in Orange County and a presidential election that will decide our country's future.

Every American should be able to vote without worrying about contracting or spreading coronavirus. That's why I'm pushing for vote by mail for all voters. Will you join me?

Did you see Katie Porter's email about Harley yesterday? Check it out below! Katie and Harley teamed up to make sure Postmaster General DeJoy was up to the job -- and he didn't even know some of the most basic elements of the USPS. If anyone knows how to ask tough questions, it's Katie Porter. And, the truth is, Harley will always be ready for the hard questions. As a member of Congress, it's exactly what he expects. But, he's also in one of the toughest re-election races in the entire country, which is why he really needs your help. Can you chip in a few dollars to keep him in Congress? Thank you! \-- Alyssa, Campaign Manager \---------- Forwarded message --------- Some of you probably saw Harley and me questioning Postmaster General Louis DeJoy about the USPS on Monday -- and you probably also saw how flummoxed he was by some of our most basic questions. Our elected and appointed officials should know their jobs inside and out -- that's what taxpayers pay us for. As one of my neighboring members, I know Harley well. And, I know that when I question him about what's happening to small business owners in Costa Mesa or how climate change is affecting our Orange County beaches or how the district is handling the coronavirus response, he knows exactly what's going on. We need to keep leaders like that in the House. That's why I'm asking if you can donate to Harley's campaign today? We're less than 70 days from Election Day, and Harley is in one of the most competitive races in the entire country.

Michelle Steel has a lot of money on hand -- millions of dollars of it -- thanks to Big Money, the NRCC, and her own corporate salary (on top of the $1.7 million she's made off taxpayers while in office!). In fact, the NRCC is giving more money to Michelle Steel than to any other frontline challenger in the entire country. Just this quarter, they donated $200,000 dollars to her campaign. That's because Michelle Steel has shown she'll toe the party line and fall in lockstep with President Trump. We need more from our leaders. Will you donate to our re-election campaign today? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: As Harley's finance director, it's pretty difficult to see our challenger raise over $1 million in a quarter -- especially when it's clear that the NRCC is targeting this race. But, I know that we can rally back and show Michelle Steel's Big Money campaign backers that we have grassroots support on our side. Will you help us send that message by donating today?

To finish off this quarter, we're joining with some of the most vulnerable California Democrats in a major final fundraising push. This quarter deadline is one of the most important ones of the entire cycle, so hitting our goal is more important now than ever. Will you help us meet our goal by donating today? These next two years will determine how our government handles the coronavirus, how our economy rebounds after this lockdown, and how our nation becomes more racially just and equal. That's why it's vital that we keep our California Democrats in the House. Will you help us do that by donating to the Keep California Blue fund today?

Right now, Christy Smith is in a heated special election to fill Katie Hill's vacated seat that comes to a close in less than three weeks. Here are three reasons why this race is so important right now: 1\. Christy has two elections in one day. 2\. POLITICO just ranked the election a toss-up, and Christy's running against some big-name Republicans, including Steve Knight, who previously held the seat and has sided with Trump at every turn. 3\. This seat flipped blue for the first time in decades last cycle. We have to keep it that way. I'm going to do everything I can to make sure Christy wins this race, and we keep this seat.

Hi -- it's Harley's campaign team, and we just wanted to let you know that Harley's Republican challengers have already started attacking Harley in their fundraising material. Their campaigns, backed by Big Money, have outraised us in the last two quarters using shady tactics like this one. We want to come out hard behind Harley this month to show Harley's opponents that the people of Orange County are going to make sure that we don't go anywhere. Will you help us do that by setting up a recurring donation to Harley now? Harley's opponents may have war chests of special interest money behind their campaigns, but we know that our grassroots strength will propel us to victory. Will you commit to a recurring donation to help us show Harley's challengers just how strong our campaign is?

Across the district, our signs are getting absolutely decimated. Like totally wrecked. Check it out ⬇️ We know it's just our opponent's obsequious followers stirring up trouble, but it's hard not to get upset over this type of vandalism.

Alex, it's a really busy time in Congress. We're in an age of uncertainty with an infectious disease devastating our world, a critical presidential election just around the corner, and our economy hanging in the balance as it grapples with an unknown future. But, I'm taking the time to email you right now because this is truly critical. Harley Rouda is running in an extremely close race against a Republican challenger who's cutting herself massive checks and welcoming truckloads of money from special interests. Orange County has shown that it's ready for two more years of Harley, but we have to back him up with the grassroots funding he needs to match his opponent's war chest. Will you help me do that by donating to his campaign today? Harley's been the single most productive freshman member of Congress. He's helped usher in some of the most critical pieces of legislation we've had in these past couple of years. We can't lose him to someone who's funding her campaign with massive checks from corporate polluters and Big Oil. I'm not going to let that happen, but that means I need your help.

Hey there! It's Nicole, Harley's finance director. With only 19 days until the election, you can bet that I'm keeping my eye on how many small dollar donations we're bringing in and how many big checks our opponent is raking in. So, when I got the FEC notification just minutes ago that Michelle Steel's Q3 numbers were in and saw that she's given herself 1.7 million dollars over the course of this campaign, you can imagine just how motivated I became to show her that we can still beat her with our small dollar donors. But, that's why I've got to ask you: can you pitch in just a few dollars to our campaign right now? Yeah -- you read that right. She's given herself 1.7 million dollars. So, I really mean it when I say that we need every single one of you to pitch in something to help us meet a massive haul like that. Can you help us get there by donating today?

Last week at the presidential debate, Joe Biden reminded us that we're not living with coronavirus, like Donald Trump would like us to think, we're dying with it.

Tomorrow marks 80 days until Election Day. And we are still in one of the most competitive races across the entire country -- against an opponent who's risked lives with her coronavirus guidance, who's publicly made homophobic jokes, and who's standing by Trump at every move. That means these next 80 days are a sprint, and we need to lay it all out on the table. Unlike our opponent, who's raking in big checks from megadonors, our campaign is dependent on everyday folks like you who show that they care about who represents their interests in Congress. That's why we're offering Harley Rouda merchandise for anyone who donates over $25 to our campaign. Can you donate to our campaign today? Harley's victory in 2018 was the first Democrat victory in the district -- ever. And we won that race by doing everything that we could to spread Harley's message to Orange County voters.

Hi Alex -- it's Kaira, Harley's wife. I'm just reaching out to see how your Halloween is going and tell you a little about ours. This Halloween is a bit different than years past: our kids are grown, trick-or-treaters will be sparse, and Harley's election is in just three days. But, truthfully, it feels like a scarier Halloween than any I ever remember having. There are so many things at stake for this election, both in CA-48 and across the country, and truthfully I feel scared of what will happen if people like Harley's opponent are elected. So, this Halloween, I hope you can enjoy the holiday's spookiness and also help us end the real spookiness on November 3rd by donating to Harley's campaign. Can you do that? I've seen Harley's opponent put people's lives on the line during this coronavirus crisis, and it's honestly terrifying. She's supposed to be leading our county as our top official, yet she's going to maskless events and began this pandemic implying masks could be dangerous. It's hard seeing Harley with those same fears for our district and knowing that there's a real possibility his opponent could unseat him and take her policies and beliefs to the Capitol. I want to make sure that doesn't happen. Can you help me by donating to Harley's campaign today?

We emailed you yesterday about how Harley's opponent is stockpiling her war chest. Well, we crunched the numbers and found that the average donation amount to her campaign is over 10 times what ours is. We're proud of that because it means that our campaign is fueled by everyday folks like you. Because our campaign is truly grassroots, we depend on small donations. Can you donate $10 to our campaign today? Our campaign is about serving everyday Orange Countians -- not deep-pocketed special interests. Will you help us send a message to Harley's opponent that our grassroots strength is strong enough to match their war chest by donating today?

Hi Alex, it's true. I do have a confession to make -- and it's exactly what our latest video ad is all about. I've forwarded my team's email so you can check it out.

There are harmful chemicals, called PFAS, found in everyday household items that could cause health issues ranging from cancer to infertility to impaired child development. And, while our communities are breathing in harmful toxins and drinking polluted water, Trump is doing absolutely nothing to protect us. That is terrifying, which is why I'm doing everything I can to make sure that we regulate these chemicals, clean up contamination, and protect public health. Will you join me? I introduced a bill to hold PFAS polluters accountable for their role in contaminating our water, air, and environment with these detrimental chemicals. And I also helped pass the PFAS Action Act of 2019. But we can't make any difference on ridding PFAS without action from the Senate.

Nicole from our team emailed you yesterday telling you that the NRCC just put Harley's opponent on their Young Guns list. That's a signal to everyone, including the gun lobby, to flood our race with dark money. Harley, on the other hand, is not a Young Gun and is not taking a cent from the gun lobby (or any other corporate special interest group). Rather, he was just awarded the 2020 Moms Demand Action Gun Sense Candidate distinction AND was just endorsed by Brady United Against Gun Violence and by Giffords: Courage to Fight Gun Violence. That's because Harley's working to protect our community and our children from gun violence, while his opponent is actively wooing gun lobbyists. The differences between Harley's views and that of his opponent could not be more disparate. It's critical we keep value-driven leaders like Harley in Congress.

Some of you probably saw Harley and me questioning Postmaster General Louis DeJoy about the USPS on Monday -- and you probably also saw how flummoxed he was by some of our most basic questions. Our elected and appointed officials should know their jobs inside and out -- that's what taxpayers pay us for. As one of my neighboring members, I know Harley well. And, I know that when I question him about what's happening to small business owners in Costa Mesa or how climate change is affecting our Orange County beaches or how the district is handling the coronavirus response, he knows exactly what's going on. We need to keep leaders like that in the House. That's why I'm asking if you can donate to Harley's campaign today? We're less than 70 days from Election Day, and Harley is in one of the most competitive races in the entire country. That's why I have to ask if you'll help Harley hit his end-of-month fundraising goal before Monday. Can you donate today?

Our end of the month deadline is tonight as midnight. Each of these deadlines leading up to Election Day is critical -- they allow us to show that our grassroots support will match every six-figure check Michelle Steel receives. When it comes down to it, we're facing someone who could easily have more money in the bank on Election Day than we do -- not because she has more support but because she's got Big Money on her side. But, we're going to do everything we can to try to match her fundraising each and every deadline. Can you help us do that by donating today? We're so proud that we're running a grassroots campaign. It means we're backed by the people Harley's serving. But, it does mean that we have to work that much harder to match the massive hauls Harley's competitor receives from Big Money.

Trump-enthusiast Mike Garcia recently defeated Democrat Christy Smith in CA-25 -- a seat we flipped in 2018. The election showed that even though Dems won in close races last election, no seat is safe. That's why it's more important than ever to give to Harley's re-election campaign today. Can you do that? Our race is ranked a "toss-up" by POLITICO, and Harley's opponent is still being bankrolled by the NRCC and massive corporate special interests.

Today, Donald Trump and Joe Biden were set to answer the American People's questions about their presidencies in a nationally televised town hall -- that is, until, Donald Trump decided he wouldn't do it virtually. And, like Donald Trump, our opponent has also refused to participate in debates with Harley. But, the thing is, these debates are where undecided voters learn about the candidates. It's where the American People get to see who aligns with their values and who they want to lead them. Refusing to debate robs voters of that chance.

Last week, Michelle Steel spoke in front of the Orange County Board of Supervisors and argued that humans shouldn't have to wear masks because the CDC recommends that pets don't wear them. [[URL REDACTED]] heard us right. She said *on record* it's "species discrimination" if humans have to wear masks when dogs shouldn't. That's disturbing and all the more reason why we need to make sure Harley's the one still representing after November. Will you help us do that by donating to our campaign today?

Our campaign is dependent on everyday folks chipping in small amounts to our campaign -- it's what makes Harley untethered to Big Money and lobbyists and able to serve the interest of Orange Countians. And $5 is enough to make a huge difference in this election. Can you donate that? Take Rhett Buckley. Even after losing a campus job due to COVID-19, Rhett opened his wallet and gave us $5 -- it's stories like Rhett's that make us so proud to be part of a grassroots campaign. Check it out ⬇️ Shunning Big Money means that Harley can do what he knows is best for hardworking folks in the district without worrying about whether lobbyists will like it.

I am absolutely speechless. Take a look >> It's hard to know where to start with this video -- but it's nearly impossible to deny that it shows just how deep Michelle Steel's homophobia runs. I am not okay with the possibility of our future Congressperson being so outwardly homophobic -- and you shouldn't be either. It could jeopardize some of our country's biggest LGBTQ victories.

Harley and Alyssa emailed you yesterday about Michelle Steel attending an in-person fundraiser without masks. We just learned this wasn't a one-off. Just a week ago, she took a mask-less photo at a major indoor event for the right-wing leader Charlie Kirk. Check out her individual picture when he was off the main stage ⬇️ Let us be the first to tell you: jeopardizing lives for photo ops and big checks is not good leadership. Frankly, it's wrong, dangerous, and just plain selfish. We can't let someone like that take CA-48. But, the thing is: if we don't finish strong in this final week, that might just happen.

Tomorrow marks 100 days until Election Day. Today, we're celebrating by calling folks across Orange County to tell them why they should cast their ballots for Harley. This is a big deal. It's our opportunity to tell everyone in Orange County that the difference between Harley and his opponent is stark and very significant. While Harley's defending Orange County families, Michelle Steel is putting out faulty coronavirus data and spreading damaging information about coronavirus. Will you join us for this Day of Action by signing up for a calling shift throughout the day? The two-hour slots include a 20-minute training, and you can make the calls from anywhere! If you can't make calls, there's good news: we're also setting an ambitious "100 Days Out" fundraising goal that we know you can help us hit.

This weekend marks 100 days until Election Day!!! To celebrate, we'll be having a Day of Action on Saturday, calling voters to share Harley's message, and a special fundraising push to show Michelle Steel and her Big Money allies that we're ready for November. Can you help us get ready for November by signing up for our very special Day of Action or by helping us meet our fundraising deadline before the end of the weekend? It's go-time. Especially after hearing that Michelle Steel raised over $1 million last quarter, we know that we have an uphill battle ahead of us.

Alex -- I just wanted to make sure you saw that the OC Register endorsed Harley? This is huge news -- he's the only Democratic congressional candidate in Orange County to receive an endorsement from the Register. For all we know about our opponent's history of mishandling crises, making homophobic statements, and following Trump's every move, we can't be too surprised. But, on top of all of that, their endorsement of Harley also shows just how unprepared Michelle Steel is. Check it out ⬇️ The OC Register is just the latest of a flurry of endorsements from major organizations across the district and country, including from the US Chamber of Commerce, the International Association of Fire Fighters, and the Asian American Action Fund. The consensus is clear: Harley is the one who's ready to fight for Orange County families from Day One. Can you donate now to help us re-elect him?

Hey Alex -- we're only a week away from Election, so I'm going to get straight to the point. Michelle Steel, Orange County's top official, has publicly understated coronavirus's toll in Orange County. She's implied wearing masks are dangerous. And now she's just been spotted at two recent major indoor events without masks (check out the picture below!). The worst part of the whole thing? She's within striking distance of taking this seat. This is about more than just whether this seat is red or blue. This is about protecting the lives of families in Orange County and people across the US. We need your help. Can you donate today? One week left to push! \-- Nicole LeClerc \---------- Forwarded message --------- Harley and Alyssa emailed you yesterday about Michelle Steel attending an in-person fundraiser without masks. We just learned this wasn't a one-off. Just a week ago, she took mask-less photos at a major indoor event for the right-wing leader Charlie Kirk. Check out her individual picture when he was off the main stage ⬇️ Let us be the first to tell you: jeopardizing lives for photo ops and big checks is not good leadership. Frankly, it's wrong, dangerous, and just plain selfish. We can't let someone like that take CA-48. But, the thing is: if we don't finish strong in this final week, that might just happen. Can you help us widen the gap by donating right now? Thank you!!! \-- Rouda HQ Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hi Alex -- I just wanted to reach out to let you know that our end-of-quarter fundraising deadline is tomorrow, and we need your help if we're going to reach our goal. The truth is: this is the most important fundraising deadline we've had yet in this campaign. With only 35 days left until Election Day, this is one of the final indicators of where we stand in this race and will dictate just how much we can spend to reach undecided folks before voting ends.

Thank you. Monday marked our end-of-month deadline, and, with your help, we hit our fundraising goal. That means a lot -- especially right now. Hitting our goal this month means we'll have the funds needed to reach critical voters before Election Day, including the many Orange Countians who will be voting by mail before November 3rd. It also means that we have a solid base of fundraising that we can use to compete with our special interest-backed opponent. I don't take any of this for granted.

Hi there! Did you see Nicole's email about this quarter? It's a really big one for us because it's one of our final chances to show how many grassroots supporters back Harley before the November election. Especially after a new rating indicated that Harley's race is the most competitive in Orange County, these fundraising numbers are very important. Will you help us bring in record fundraising hauls this quarter by donating to our campaign today? Thanks! \-- Rouda HQ \---------- Forwarded message --------- Hi there. June is our second to last chance to post the kind of end of quarter numbers that will silence the NRCC once and for all. A new rating just showed that our race is the most competitive in all of Orange County. That's a sign to the NRCC that they should jump straight into our race and try everything they can to flip it red. Our best bet to fend off these attacks is to post record high end of quarter fundraising numbers. Will you help us do that by donating to our campaign today? I'm just going to say it bluntly: we need a huge fundraising showing this June. With the election just months away, hitting our target this end of quarter is non-negotiable.

Donald Trump came to Orange County yesterday, cheering on masses of people who took to the streets to see him and hosting a high-roller fundraiser despite COVID spiraling out of control across the country. Michelle Steel, who is supposed to oversee our response to this deadly virus, was absolutely silent about the president's visit. But, this is nothing new. She's said nothing in the face of countless Trump offenses. We need someone who will actually stand up for what's right, even when it goes against party wishes. That's why we need to re-elect Harley Rouda. Can you help us do that by donating today? We can't be all too surprised Michelle Steel didn't say anything about Trump's super-spreader event in Orange County. She's done this all too many times before! She was silent when Trump called our military heroes "losers," she said nothing when Trump tried to take away health care for those with pre-existing conditions, and she didn't say a thing when he said he was purposefully understating the coronavirus. We need someone to represent us who will actually use their voice. That's why I'm asking: can you donate to Harley's re-election campaign today?

With your help, Congressman Rouda defeated Russia's favorite candidate, Dana Rohrabacher, in 2018. Now, a Wall Street Journal article has named Shawn Steel, of Shawn Steel Law Firm (where County Chairwoman Michelle Steel works and makes $325,000 on top of the $1,700,000 she's made off taxpayers during her time in office), as one of the key individuals involved in a pay-to-play scheme to connect Chinese Communist Party leaders with President Trump. Perhaps Michelle Steel isn't involved in her husband's attempts to compromise our national security and elections. But then why did she not even respond when Harley called upon her last year to join a pledge denouncing foreign interference in U.S. elections -- what are she and her husband hiding? It's time for Michelle Steel to denounce foreign interference in our elections once and for all. Will you join us in calling on her again to protect the sanctity of our free and fair elections? County Chairwoman Steel has failed time and time again to condemn pay to play schemes and foreign election interference. Will you join us in demanding accountability? Thank you! \-- Nicole LeClerc, Finance Director Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Alex, It's hard to overstate just how important it was to hit our fundraising goal this quarter. With my opponent and me locked in a dead heat this close to Election Day, deadlines like this one really can sway the momentum of this race. And, because of you, we hit our goal and are in a good place to reach the undecided voters we need before Election Day. I'm reaching out to personally thank you. When I made the decision to run for Congress, I decided that I was going to rely on grassroots donors -- not corporate special interests. So, when I say that this is all because of you, I truly do mean it. Now we've got 33 days to secure this election. And, it's not going to be easy. But, that's why I'm just so happy you're on our team. Together, I know that we can keep this seat blue and continue to make progress in Orange County and throughout the country.

Tomorrow marks one year since the House passed the For the People Act, the landmark campaign finance reform bill that protects the American people from dark money.

Hi! Harley's field team here. We wanted to follow up on Harley's email (forwarded below) to see if you can help make some calls for Christy? What we do between now and Tuesday could decide whether Christy wins or loses this election. Every single conversation with a potential voter matters. That's why we're asking if you'll consider signing up to volunteer for Christy's team today? The Republicans are gunning for this seat, and they're giving everything to show their strength before November. That makes it even more important that we share Christy's message with CA-25 voters and let them know that it's more important than ever to hold on to this seat. Will you sign up to volunteer with Christy Smith's team? Thank you! \-- Harley's Field Team \---------- Forwarded message --------- To our north in CA-25, Christy Smith is in a neck and neck race against a Trump enthusiast who's cozy with Big Money. The election will be decided this Tuesday. This seat was firmly red for over two decades before Democrats flipped it as part of the Blue Wave in 2018. Now, the Republican party and its Big Money allies are pouring money into ads in the district to try to take the seat back. Christy really needs our help. Will you donate today to show the Republicans that this seat is staying blue? Flipping CA-25 was part of the historic Blue Wave that flipped seven Republican stronghold seats across California, including my seat. I know that the NRCC is aching to take back these seats, so it's all the more important that we send them the message that we're here to stay. Will you help me send that message by donating to Christy today? Thank you! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hi there. Coming off another Election Day, I've been thinking a lot about how our campaigns are funded. So many campaigns are funded by special interests groups with ambiguous names and undisclosed donors, which makes it near impossible to track down where a candidate's support comes from. That's not the way we run our campaign, and that's not the way campaigns should be run. That's why on the 1-year anniversary of the For the People Act making its way through the House, I'm asking if you'll citizen co-sponsor the For the People Act >>> One year ago, I joined my colleagues in the House in passing the For the People Act. And now it's sitting on Mitch McConnell's desk where he refuses to take it up. That's why I need your help to tell McConnell that we want action on campaign finance now. Can you sign on?

I'm with Harley: I'm nervous, Alex. It's Election Day, and we know we're in for a race that won't be quickly decided. Just like the New York Times, the LA Times, and The Independent, Harley and I both know that this race is going to be as close as it gets. But, rather than twiddling our thumbs waiting on the results, we're going to keep on fighting to make sure we can keep reaching voters and hitting our budget goals. That's why I'm asking: can you donate $10 right now? Happy Election Day! \-- Alyssa Napuri, Campaign Manager \---------- Forwarded message --------- I've always known this is going to be a competitive race.

Especially because this race has huge consequences for people in Orange County and across the country. Can you help me secure two more years in Washington by donating today? We've got a lot on the line this election. Fundamental rights and basic safety could be stripped away if my opponent wins this race.

Whoa. The Independent (yes, the news source in the UK that reports on all things across the entire globe) just made a list of seven of what they think are the "most interesting House races to watch on Election Night."

Harley won the seat in 2018 as part of the Blue Wave, but that was an anomaly. He was the first Democrat to ever win this seat in a district where Democrats are in the minority.

Hi there! I'm just reaching out because our mid-month deadline is in just three days. And our campaign just received some really big news: the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican Super PAC, is spending over a million more dollars to try to flip this seat red. That's why hitting our goal is so important. It will determine if we're on pace to hit our quarter fundraising goal, which will ultimately show everyone in the district where the momentum is going in this race.

A week ago, Harley came to me with a question: why are we waiting for our country to protect our healthcare workers and first responders when every moment during this crisis is critical? And a solution: let's cut out the bureaucracy and connect the people with personal protective equipment directly to the people who need it. Yesterday, he did just that. He brought thousands of gloves, hundreds of face shields, and twenty respirators to MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center, protecting the lives of our healthcare workers and all of the patients they care for.

Hi Alex, I'm just quickly reaching out to let you know that there are only ten days until this election is over, and we're going to have to keep fighting up until the moment polls close. I'll tell you why: Republicans still outnumber Democrats in the district, and now radical right special interest groups are throwing their weight behind my opponent because she'll rubber stamp their out of touch policies. I know it's not going to be easy to keep this seat. But, that's all the more reason to fight tooth-and-nail until we win this race. We simply can't afford to let up. I know we can do this. But, I will need your help. Can you donate a few dollars today to help us continue our fight until Election Day? You're truly making a difference here, \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hi there. I'm just reaching out to thank you for helping us reach our internal mid-month fundraising goal. With our quarter ending in just two weeks, hitting this goal was the first step towards reaching our quarter goal, and meeting our quarter goal will go a long way towards showing just how much enthusiasm there is for this campaign before the election.

In the midst of a global health crisis, this 50th anniversary of Earth Day feels a bit different than most. As we continue to social distance, we've already seen what having fewer cars on the road has done for congestion and pollution here in Orange County. It's a reminder of what our earth could look like if we continued to protect it from degradation. But, even now, our environment is continually under threat. Trump's EPA is using COVID-19 as an excuse to stop enforcing environmental protections. I'm calling on President Trump to protect our earth by continuing to enforce these essential environmental protections. Will you join me? We must protect our earth today, so our children and our children's children can enjoy it tomorrow. That's why it is so critical to tell President Trump that we can't stop enforcing environmental protections. Will you add your name if you agree? Thank you for taking action to help protect our earth, and, if you are able, I encourage you to go outside, practice social distancing, and enjoy all that the earth has to offer!

Last night, Harley debated... an empty chair. You heard that right. He went to debate his opponent, and she never showed -- calling the debate biased because a local Democratic group wanted to have a watch party of the event. The truth is: Michelle Steel has been ignoring attempts to hold a debate for weeks. From our standpoint, she was just looking for an "out" from this event. We need leaders who will be accountable to voters by actually engaging in thoughtful, fair debates before the election. Will you donate right now to help us elect Harley? Harley's in Congress because he wants to include your voice in our country's most important issues. And, he knows that one of the best ways to show you that he'll do that is through a live, moderated, and fair debate with his opponent. Will you donate ahead of our end-of-month deadline to show that you support Harley's commitment to Orange Countians?

My opponent is in charge of making sure Orange Countians are safe from the novel coronavirus. Yet, she's mocking the idea of wearing masks as unsafe and "species discrimination." Masks, to me, make complete sense. In fact, I just wrote an Op-Ed about how masks will allow us to reopen our economy, restore jobs, and return to everyday life. I'm on the side of Orange Countians, and I promise to keep fighting to protect Orange Countians. Will you donate now to help me continue to serve all of you? This election is just months away, which means that finishing with a strong fundraising quarter is especially important right now. This election will have huge consequences throughout Orange County and across our nation. That's why I have to ask if you can donate to our re-election campaign right now?

We're really close to this election. Like less than four weeks until people start receiving their mail-in ballots and less than eight weeks until this election is decided type of close. That means that what you give right now could make the difference. We just barely won our race in 2018. But, we did because enough of you came out and demanded change in Orange County. We need to do that again. That's why we've got to ask if you'll donate right now >> These final eight weeks can determine the trajectory of this race. We're neck-and-neck with our opponent, but we know she's going to pour money into TV ads throughout the district. That means it's on us to do everything we can to keep this seat -- and that depends on people like you giving us small donations during these critical weeks. Can you do that?

We're living through a pivotal period in history that has the potential to transform our nation. We need leaders who we can trust to guide us through this turning point. Michelle Steel has put the lives of Orange Countians at risk time and time again. She's implied that wearing masks is hazardous to human lives (despite medical evidence), she's called for repealing the Affordable Care Act, and she's stood with Trump through every one of his hateful remarks. Harley, on the other hand, has connected healthcare workers with the protective gear they need, is voting today to strengthen and broaden the ACA, and is standing for human rights each and every day. The choice is obvious in our mind. Will you donate today if you agree that we need at least two more years of Harley? Our quarter ends tomorrow, so this is our last chance to show Michelle Steel and her deep-pocketed allies that our grassroots team is not backing down. We're ready to stand for what's right and make sure Harley has two more years in the House. Can you help us do that by donating today?

Alex -- I hope this finds you well and that you and your family are staying safe and healthy. I wanted to make sure you saw Harley's message about checking in on your neighbors. In this trying time, I am so proud to work for a leader who prioritizes our health and safety, which is why I'm more focused than ever on re-electing Harley -- a leader who consistently puts folks in CA-48 first. Take a look at the message that Harley sent along about checking in on your neighbors. If you are able to pitch in to help re-elect our value-driven leader, we would deeply appreciate it. Thank you for being part of our team, \-- Alyssa Napuri, Campaign Director \---------- Forwarded message --------- Hi Alex, Above all else, I want to check in on you and your loved ones. I hope that you all are staying safe and healthy during this difficult time. Health and safety are our top priorities during this time, which is why we've suspended our field program, cancelled all in-person events, and changed up our phone banks. In fact, yesterday, our campaign launched a new program to call and check in our senior neighbors. Will you join us and check on our elderly neighbors? This is a scary time for all of us, but there's a lot that we can do to show our neighbors that they are not alone in facing this threat. Will you join me and call our seniors?

Hi Alex -- I'm reaching out a few hours before our critical end-of-quarter deadline to let you know why your donation right now will go such a long way. We're in one of the most competitive districts in the entire country. In fact, our 2018 underdog victory was the first win by a Democrat in the district ever, and there are more Republicans in this district than Democrats. It only makes sense that POLITICO calls our race a "toss-up," and Inside Elections has named it the most competitive in Orange County. We're also in one of the most crucial times of the campaign. Voters will receive their mail-in ballots in just days, so now is our chance to share my message with undecided voters. And the consequences of this race will reverberate throughout Orange County. My opponent is threatening the ACA, women's rights, LGBTQ equality, and gun control. So, when I say that your donation right now is really important, I mean it. Can you donate today?

My campaign team just showed me an email from one of my competitors who is attacking me to raise money. I can't say that I'm surprised, but it makes me really want to show my opponents the support we have on our side. That's why I'm hoping you'll set up a monthly recurring contribution to help us meet our January goal? We're hoping to reach 100 new monthly donations by midnight tonight, and we're getting close. But, we still need 22 more of you to set up a donation in order to meet our goal and show my competitors that this district is backing me through November and beyond. Will you help me do that by donating to our campaign today? Thank you! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

An unprecedented health crisis calls for unprecedented action: schools are closed across the nation, sports seasons are proposing unheard of adaptations, and movies are premiering straight on TV -- all to prevent the further spread of coronavirus. But, the Senate is refusing to declare this an emergency, which would allow any voter to vote by mail. Not only is this an emergency, but also it's an emergency that requires we remain at home for our safety and the safety of those around us. Harley's calling on the Senate to pass the Natural Disaster and Emergency Ballot Act of 2020 to make sure Americans can vote safely. Will you join him? This bill will make it much easier to safely vote from home, securing a more fair election and stopping the spread of coronavirus in crowded polling places. This bill just makes sense. Will you show your support for it by adding your name today? Thank you for taking action! \-- Team Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Today, Harley's heading to Newport Beach to debate Michelle Steel -- if she decides to actually show up. Fair debates are routine parts of political campaigns. They're also one of the best ways for folks to learn about the people they're voting for. So, it just leaves us questioning why Michelle Steel is so adamantly and blatantly against a fair debate.

Hi there. I just wanted to reach out because tomorrow is our end of the month fundraising deadline. I'm so proud of the grassroots campaign we're running, but we're up against Big Money, the NRCC, and a competitor who's writing herself six-figure checks. That makes it all the more important to have strong showings each month that represent our broad network of grassroots supporters. Will you donate today to help us reach our grassroots fundraising goal this month? In CA-25, we just saw a seat we flipped in 2018 fall to a Trump-backing Republican. It was historic that I was elected last election cycle, but I can't take it for granted that I'll be re-elected this year.

That's right, Harley was able to get 23 Orange Countians traveling across the world back home in the midst of this global health crisis. Will you read the story to learn more about how Harley did it?

President Trump openly admitted to blocking USPS funding to stop Americans from voting safely and securely. Let me repeat: the President of the United States of America publicly confirmed that he is actively sabotaging our right to a free and fair election. This is bigger than petty partisan politics; it is an attack on the foundation of our nation. This is a war waged on the bedrock principles of our republic -- the right to use your vote to make your voice heard and hold elected officials accountable. This is a "where were you and what did you do to stop it" moment in history. With the election right around the corner, I need your help to keep defending our democracy. Can you give now? I'll keep doing everything I can to protect our elections, including questioning Postmaster General DeJoy, supporting efforts to preserve USPS, and sounding the alarm -- but I need your help.

Since the get-go, our opponent has made it crystal clear she has no interest in debating Harley -- even though that's one of the most important ways voters get to know what the candidates stand for. We're left grasping at straws why she's not giving Orange Countians a chance to see her take on some of our most pressing issues. But, Seinfeld's Jason Alexander helped moderate a "debate" between Harley and Michelle, using her previous statements about critical questions. We think it shows you just how important it is to make absolutely certain Harley's elected in five days, but we'll let you be the judge. Will you watch the clip and then donate to our campaign? Michelle Steel has spread dangerous anti-mask rhetoric, promoted homophobic views, and wants to repeal the ACA. You can even hear it for yourself in our "debate"!

I won't sugarcoat it -- our final FEC deadline before the election is right around the corner, and we need your help to hit our fundraising goal. Unlike Harley's opponent, our campaign isn't funded by Big Money and corporate special interests. Instead, we rely on small-dollar donations from hard working folks like you. But that also means we need your help before our final major deadline before Election Day. Can you donate $25 now to support our grassroots campaign? Our race is one of the most competitive races in the entire country. In fact, Inside Elections even named it the most competitive race in all of Orange County.

We are officially only ten weeks from Election Day. That means we only have a few more major fundraising deadlines before this race is decided. Monday marks one of those major deadlines: it's one of our very last end-of-month fundraising deadlines. And we really need your help if we're going to hit our goal. Can you donate today? The Republican National Convention solidified that the Party's unifying around Trump -- and we all know Michelle Steel will continue to stand in lockstep with Trump. This election could be generation-defining. We can't let Trump appointees take office and steer our country towards a Trump agenda. That's why we really need you to donate before Monday.

1\. I'm so proud of how my team has stepped up to serve our community in this crisis. We've used this campaign's resources to collect PPE for frontline workers in Orange County and raise tens of thousands of dollars for groups doing crucial work. 2\. Even while doing all of that, we're still running a very strong re-election campaign in a very tough district. In fact, before our win in 2018, a Democrat had never won CA-48! 3\. These last few months have made it so painfully clear that we need leaders in office who will put the needs of the communities they represent above political interests.

Hi there -- our end-of-quarter deadline is tonight at midnight -- and, in all honesty, hitting our goal is an essential step towards giving our grassroots campaign the momentum we need to keep this seat blue on Election Day. That's why I have to ask: can you donate to our campaign today? We know this race isn't going to be easy. It wasn't easy in 2018 when Harley became the first Democrat to win this seat ever. And it won't be easy today. Corporate special interest groups are flooding our race with Big Money, POLITICO has rated our race a toss-up, and Republicans make up the majority of our district. That's why donations from folks like you are so important. They help us reach the undecided voters in Orange County who could ultimately help determine who wins this race.

Alex, Throughout Orange County and the nation, the effects of the coronavirus have rattled our communities and revolutionized our conception of work. For some folks, that's meant responding to life-threatening emergencies every single day. For others, it's been teaching students over Zoom for the first time ever. And, for a lot of folks, that's meant being laid off and forced to search for work in a time of global economic uncertainty. In this context, Labor Day has a powerful and distinct meaning. It's understanding the role of labor in the context of our own lives, as well as its role in our communities. So, I hope you also put aside some time today to reflect upon how this pandemic has affected the jobs and livelihoods of people across our county and our nation. And, I also hope you spend some of your time enjoying the holiday and safely cooling off from the heat. Happy Labor Day! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Early ballots for Harley's March election are already here, which is a really big deal because this election is the first chance to show how much Harley's constituents approve of his performance in office. Here's the bad news: The NRCC is funneling money into Harley's challengers' campaigns, and one of Harley's competitors is even writing herself checks for half a million dollars.

Hey Alex -- I just wanted to see if you saw Alyssa's email from yesterday (forwarded below). I've been asking my opponent to join me for a debate for weeks now, and she hasn't said anything about it. Debates are a critical way for voters to see where candidates stand on issues and how they differ from each other. And debates don't end with the campaign -- they're a major part of my duties on Capitol Hill. That's why I'm shocked that my opponent won't even acknowledge our request -- and we can be pretty sure that she's gotten the message. Can you join me in calling on Michelle to join us for a debate? Thank you! \-- Harley \---------- Forwarded message --------- Harley's asked his opponent for a debate. In several different ways. And multiple times. Her campaign still hasn't said a thing about it. We sent another letter to her team today letting them know that Harley's going to be available on August 30th at 6pm in Newport Beach for a debate -- whether or not she decides to actually come debate him. This is where we need your help: will you sign on to our petition to urge Michelle to show up for the debate? Our elected officials are expected to debate. That's just part of the job description and why it's so surprising that in the midst of many crises and with fewer than 75 days until the election, she's remaining completely silent. Will you sign our petition to demand that Michelle agree to a debate? Thanks for signing on! \-- Alyssa, Campaign Manager Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hey -- it's Alyssa, Harley's campaign manager. I'm reaching out because Harley's on his way to meet Michelle for their debate. However, it's unlikely she'll even turn up. We want to show Harley that, even though his opponent is refusing to engage, we still think he's doing the right thing by trying to facilitate a debate. That's why we're going to try to flood him with donations for the rest of the night -- it'll be the perfect way to show him that we support his effort and to help us reach our end-of-month fundraising goal. Will you donate right now to our campaign? Harley's opponent is doing everything she can to get out of debating Harley. She even just tried to blame her absence on the fact that a local Democratic group is going to be watching the debate. We've already told her that we're trying to make this as fair as possible, but she won't even engage the possibility of a debate. Will you show Harley you support his call for a fair debate by donating today? Thanks for being with us! \-- Alyssa, Campaign Manager Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Happy Halloween! Today's supposed to be the spookiest day of the year, but you know as well as I do that this year has been full of spookiness. There may be fewer haunted houses and scary Halloween gatherings, but I think this year takes the cake (or the trick-or-treat loot!) for scariest one on record. That's, in large part, because the election is in just three days, and up and down the ballot there are races that could define the trajectory of our country for generations \-- including mine.

When Harley heard that Newt Gingrich was fundraising for Michelle Steel, he filled us in on why this meant so much to him (more info in the forwarded email below!). Harley left the Republican Party because of the way Newt Gingrich insisted the Republican Party take hard-line positions on social issues. It's really important that we come out as strong as we can before Newt Gingrich's fundraiser to show him that we, like Harley, will not let our politics take away people's basic human rights. Can you help us do that by donating to Harley's re-election campaign today? Thanks! \-- Rouda HQ \---------- Forwarded message --------- My opponent, Michelle Steel, just announced she'll be calling on Newt Gingrich to help her fundraise. I'm actually glad to hear that. Newt Gingrich was the reason why I left the Republican Party in 1997. So, for her to choose Newt to headline a fundraiser only serves as further validation of how different our priorities really are. While Newt and Michelle attempt to restrict rights for LGBTQ folks and take away a woman's right to choose, I am fighting to expand people's rights and promote equality for all Americans. Will you help send a message to Newt and Michelle by donating to our campaign today? As Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich changed Republican politics for the worse. Under his leadership, the GOP shifted from a party focused on small government to one which insisted government influence over social issues. I knew that I couldn't be a part of the Republican Party when its policies became intertwined with disallowing LGBTQ folks from marrying, restricting the right to choose for women, ignoring climate science, and vilifying immigration. People like Michelle Steel and Newt Gingrich will continue to make politics about taking away rights and exacerbating partisanship. I think we should be doing the opposite. If you agree, will you donate to my campaign today? Thank you for showing your values! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Kamala Harris made history yesterday. She's the first woman of color to join the presidential ticket of a major party -- ever. And this is just the start. I know that once they take the White House, the Biden-Harris team will continue to break through barriers and make historic leaps every chance they get. But, I also know that they're up against a self-proclaimed billionaire opponent who doesn't play by the rules. We need to give the Biden-Harris ticket every ounce of support we can muster, and that starts with a donation today. Can you split a donation between the Biden-Harris campaign and our re-election fund today? Contributions will be split between Harley Rouda for Congress and Biden for President. We have to throw our full weight behind Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Between gun violence, climate change, and women's rights, we can't afford to have the Trump Administration set us back any further. It's up to each and every one of us to do our part to get Trump out of the White House. That's why I need to ask if you will split a donation today between our campaign and the Biden-Harris campaign today?

Our monthly fundraising deadline is in a few days, and because it's the first month of an election year, our goal this month is a bit different. Because we're a grassroots campaign dependent on small consistent donations from all of you, our goal is to have 100 people set up monthly recurring donations for Harley. It doesn't matter if the amount you donate is only a couple dollars -- we're just excited to have you on our team. What do you say: will you set up a recurring donation today? Our competitors have war chests flooded with funds from Big Money. Harley refuses to accept money from corporate special interests, but that means that we rely on your grassroots donations to compete with their hauls.

Alex, A few weeks ago, I asked if you would consider donating to some of our local Orange County organizations that are doing their part to help fight the effects of the coronavirus. You answered with unmistakable force, allowing us to collectively donate almost $15,000 to our local charities. With your donations, we can put food on the table for our recently unemployed Orange Countians. We can support our valiant health care workers who are risking their lives to protect ours. We can help our small businesses who are facing bankruptcy due to closures. As we face another week of sheltering-in-place and as we anticipate more coronavirus cases, I'm asking if you will once again consider donating to these charities?

Hey there -- I just wanted to make sure you saw the email (forwarded below!) that Nancy Pelosi sent yesterday about our campaign. I'll be frank here: this race is becoming more and more important. Just last week, Harley's opponent called it "species discrimination" that humans should wear masks if dogs shouldn't. That's absolutely incorrect and dangerous information to spread. We can't have our elected leaders putting lives at risk by spreading damaging advice. That's why I'm asking you if you'll donate right now to Harley's re-election campaign >> Let's defend our values together! \-- Alyssa Napuri, Campaign Director \---------- Forwarded message --------- Alex, it's a really busy time in Congress. We're in an age of uncertainty with an infectious disease devastating our world, a critical presidential election just around the corner, and our economy hanging in the balance as it grapples with an unknown future. But, I'm taking the time to email you right now because this is truly critical. Harley Rouda is running in an extremely close race against a Republican challenger who's cutting herself massive checks and welcoming truckloads of money from special interests. Orange County has shown that it's ready for two more years of Harley, but we have to back him up with the grassroots funding he needs to match his opponent's war chest. Will you help me do that by donating to his campaign today? Harley's been the single most productive freshman member of Congress. He's helped usher in some of the most critical pieces of legislation we've had in these past couple of years. We can't lose him to someone who's funding her campaign with massive checks from corporate polluters and Big Oil. I'm not going to let that happen, but that means I need your help. Will you donate now to make sure we send Harley back to Washington? Let's keep California blue, \-- Nancy Pelosi Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

A new nonpartisan poll from Inside Elections just rated Harley's district as the most competitive in all of Orange County. After an over 10-point loss for Democrats in CA-25, ratings like that one are terrifying. It means we need to work that much harder to keep this seat blue. Will you help us get ready for November? We know that the odds are stacked against us in November: the NRCC and its special interest allies are targeting this race because they know just how competitive this district is. That's why we need to show them that our grassroots supporters can match their massive checks every month until Election Day. With our end of the month fundraising deadline on Sunday, we have another chance to do just that. Can you donate before then? Thank you!! \-- Team Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Coronavirus is hitting us all hard, and small businesses are being affected by necessary social distancing. Right now, I'm working to make sure that our small businesses and their employees are protected in this time of uncertainty. Last week, I helped pass an emergency supplemental bill that allows Orange County businesses to access $7 billion in low-interest loans. I want to ensure that all business owners can actually use that money to protect their businesses and their employees. If you are a small business owner, check out more information on the program >> Please utilize programs like the Small Business Administration Disaster Loans. I will continue updating our community of resources at their disposal and fight to protect our small business owners and their employees.

Hi there. This Fourth of July probably feels quite different than other ones you've had before. There won't be mass gatherings, big fireworks shows, or parades full of folks from your town. But, I encourage you to spend some time thinking about the founding of our nation: the freedom that the colonists fought for from the British -- freedom that only included some Americans. Today, we're still working towards freedom. And, I'll work tooth and nail to continue expanding freedom for every single American. This Fourth of July, let's remember these words: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." On this day, and every day henceforth, let's commit and recommit to America's ideals of equality, liberty and justice for all. Happy Fourth! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Alex -- the election is in fewer than eight weeks, and we've got some updates for you: 1\. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican Super PAC, just injected over a million dollars to this race -- almost all of which is going directly to attack ads against Harley. 2\. The NRA just endorsed Harley's opponent and gave her an "A" grade, while giving Harley an "F." That's because Harley is going to go out on a limb to protect our students and communities from gun violence, even when it means being targeted by the gun lobby and the NRA. 3\. This race is still ranked a "toss-up" by POLITICO and named the most competitive race in all of Orange County by Inside Elections. That means we need your help right now.

Yesterday, Harley sent out an email to thank you for donating to our local Orange County nonprofits and in the hopes of raising even more money for the organizations. Once again, you all delivered -- and Harley couldn't be more excited. I can tell you firsthand that Harley's been consumed by making sure Orange Countians are protected from coronavirus and its societal side effects. So, it was great to chat with him about our deep appreciation of your generous donations yesterday. He truly admires the way all of you look out for your fellow Orange Countians. I, for one, am proud to be tasked with making sure Harley is re-elected come November because I know that when times are tough, he will go the extra mile to protect his constituents. Better yet, he'll do it with excitement, tenacity, and humility. Will you help us make sure that he's still in Washington to do that by donating to our campaign today? Thank you so much, \-- Alyssa \---------- Forwarded message --------- Alex, A few weeks ago, I asked if you would consider donating to some of our local Orange County organizations that are doing their part to help fight the effects of the coronavirus. You answered with unmistakable force, allowing us to collectively donate almost $15,000 to our local charities. With your donations, we can put food on the table for our recently unemployed Orange Countians. We can support our valiant health care workers who are risking their lives to protect ours. We can help our small businesses who are facing bankruptcy due to closures. As we face another week of sheltering-in-place and as we anticipate more coronavirus cases, I'm asking if you will once again consider donating to these charities? If we step up and help each other now, we will get through this health crisis quicker and find ourselves more connected once it's over. Can you donate today to help our local organizations?

Check it out >> We all know that debates are essential. They're one of the only ways that folks can get a sense of the candidate they're voting for. Yet, Michelle Steel has left our calls for a fair debate unanswered. That's not fair to Orange Countians.

2020 is on track to be one of the warmest years in recorded history. Globally, we had the hottest January ever recorded, and it didn't rain once in cities throughout California in February. Those are records we don't want to be breaking, but it looks like President Trump is leading us on that trajectory. That's why I'm backing a climate plan that prioritizes aggressive climate action by creating new green jobs, re-joining the Paris Climate Agreement, and investing in renewable energy technology. Will you join me? Here in Orange County, we see the effects of climate change every day: from rising sea levels to unseasonable heat waves to horrific fires. The only way that we can begin to reverse climate change and protect our society, economy, and environment for generations is to take bold action today. That's what I'm doing. Will you join me?

Hi there! I'm just reaching out because our mid-month deadline is in just three days. And our campaign just received some really big news: the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican Super PAC, is spending over a million more dollars to try to flip this seat red.

It will determine if we're on pace to hit our quarter fundraising goal, which will ultimately show everyone in the district where the momentum is going in this race.

There's a lot that happens every single day, so it can be easy to forget that the election is in one month. But, let's be clear: that's reallllly soon. And we're going to need to use every single one of these next 31 days to show Orange Countians that they need to vote for Harley Rouda. Can you help us do that by donating right now? With coronavirus continuing to spread and affecting even our highest officeholders, two things are more clear than ever: we have to follow science, and we've got to protect folks' healthcare. Those are two things Harley champions and his opponent seems to dismiss. Can you donate now to help us re-elect Harley?

Last week at the presidential debate, Joe Biden reminded us that we're not living with coronavirus, like Donald Trump would like us to think, we're dying with it. So, when my opponent, who is supposed to be overseeing our response to the virus, completely ignores medical guidance and holds an indoor fundraiser without masks, you can imagine my indignation. This isn't just a matter of breaking rules -- she's risking lives once again for no good reason. I refuse to let my seat go to someone who consistently puts the people she's supposed to be representing in danger. I'm going to fight every single day up until Election Day to make sure that doesn't happen. But, I need your help to do that. Can you donate to my re-election campaign today? Tomorrow marks just one week until Election Day. And I know I keep saying this, but I really cannot highlight it enough: we are not in a safe seat. We're in one of the closest races in the entire country, and the radical right has their eyes firmly set on this seat. That's why I really need your help. Can you donate to our campaign today?

We're only three days away from Election Day, and if we don't have a huge fundraising weekend, we honestly could lose this election.

We know our opponent has told her fair share of lies during this campaign. But, she's now attacking Harley for not paying taxes (which is false) by using a business owner who owes over $25,000 in taxes. That's right. The mega TV buy they're pouring their money into attacks Harley for something he did not do by using someone who did the very thing they're accusing Harley of. That's crossing the line. I'm here to set the record straight: Harley has paid his taxes. The guy in Michelle Steel's ad has not. Check it out >> With only 18 days until Election Day, we know our opponent is going to pull out every trick in her hat.

Last night, Harley debated... an empty chair. You heard that right. He went to debate his opponent, and she never showed -- calling the debate biased because a local Democratic group wanted to have a watch party of the event. The truth is: Michelle Steel has been ignoring attempts to hold a debate for weeks. From our standpoint, she was just looking for an "out" from this event. We need leaders who will be accountable to voters by actually engaging in thoughtful, fair debates before the election. Will you donate right now to help us elect Harley? Harley's in Congress because he wants to include your voice in our country's most important issues. And, he knows that one of the best ways to show you that he'll do that is through a live, moderated, and fair debate with his opponent.

The OC Register just endorsed Harley, making him the only Democratic congressional candidate in Orange County to receive an endorsement from the newspaper! So, when we say that doesn't happen every day -- we're being very serious. Will you help Harley keep up this momentum by chipping into our campaign today? The OC Register knows that Harley is a fighter for common sense solutions, someone who will reach across the aisle to get work done, and a trusted representative of CA-48. Unlike his opponent who they thought appeared "overly reliant on GOP talking points," the Register also knows that when Harley goes to DC, he represents the needs of Orange County communities -- not just his party. That's why we're so excited to continue seeing organizations, like the Register and the US Chamber of Commerce, come down in support for Harley even when they almost exclusively endorse Republican members.

Tomorrow marks 80 days until Election Day. And we are still in one of the most competitive races across the entire country -- against an opponent who's risked lives with her coronavirus guidance, who's publicly made homophobic jokes, and who's standing by Trump at every move. That means these next 80 days are a sprint, and we need to lay it all out on the table. Unlike our opponent, who's raking in big checks from megadonors, our campaign is dependent on everyday folks like you who show that they care about who represents their interests in Congress. That's why we're offering Harley Rouda merchandise for anyone who donates over $25 to our campaign. Can you donate to our campaign today? Harley's victory in 2018 was the first Democrat victory in the district -- ever. And we won that race by doing everything that we could to spread Harley's message to Orange County voters. We need to do just as much -- if not more -- to secure Harley's re-election this year.

Alex -- we've got some exciting news: we've just released our newest TV ad! In our ad, you'll get to hear Harley's confession -- and the thing is, he's actually pretty darn proud of it. Will you take a look and then donate so we can keep it on air until Election Day? With just weeks until Election Day, we're still in one of the tightest races across the entire country. That means we need to reach as many voters as we can with Harley's message before polls close. Can you chip in today to help us keep these ads running until Harley secures the race?

Michelle Steel announced that she brought in over $1 million dollars last quarter -- including a check she wrote to herself for $500,000. It's hard to compete with someone who's got Big Money in her corner and who'll write herself a check to boost her fundraising numbers. But, we're still going to run a grassroots campaign because we know that's the right thing to do. Can you rush a donation to our campaign today?

We're really close to this election. Like less than four weeks until people start receiving their mail-in ballots and less than eight weeks until this election is decided type of close. That means that what you give right now could make the difference. We just barely won our race in 2018. But, we did because enough of you came out and demanded change in Orange County. We need to do that again. That's why we've got to ask if you'll donate right now >> These final eight weeks can determine the trajectory of this race. We're neck-and-neck with our opponent, but we know she's going to pour money into TV ads throughout the district. That means it's on us to do everything we can to keep this seat -- and that depends on people like you giving us small donations during these critical weeks. Can you do that?

Michelle Steel's team just announced that they have $2 million dollars on hand.

President Obama just announced a list of folks across the country he's endorsing. I'm very honored to say that I was on that list. The next 90 days of this campaign will be tough and hard-fought. We're competing against an opponent who has a lot of big donors and large checks behind her. But, we're fighting on the side of just values and hardworking Orange Countians. I'm grateful that President Obama saw just how vital winning this race is and stepped in to help us uphold morality and sound decision-making in Congress. Can you join President Obama by donating to our campaign today? With three months until Election Day, every single day really counts from here on out.

Did you see Katie Porter's email about Harley yesterday? Check it out below! Katie and Harley teamed up to make sure Postmaster General DeJoy was up to the job -- and he didn't even know some of the most basic elements of the USPS. If anyone knows how to ask tough questions, it's Katie Porter. And, the truth is, Harley will always be ready for the hard questions. As a member of Congress, it's exactly what he expects. But, he's also in one of the toughest re-election races in the entire country, which is why he really needs your help. Can you chip in a few dollars to keep him in Congress? Thank you! \-- Alyssa, Campaign Manager \---------- Forwarded message --------- Some of you probably saw Harley and me questioning Postmaster General Louis DeJoy about the USPS on Monday -- and you probably also saw how flummoxed he was by some of our most basic questions. Our elected and appointed officials should know their jobs inside and out -- that's what taxpayers pay us for. As one of my neighboring members, I know Harley well. And, I know that when I question him about what's happening to small business owners in Costa Mesa or how climate change is affecting our Orange County beaches or how the district is handling the coronavirus response, he knows exactly what's going on. We need to keep leaders like that in the House. That's why I'm asking if you can donate to Harley's campaign today? We're less than 70 days from Election Day, and Harley is in one of the most competitive races in the entire country. That's why I have to ask if you'll help Harley hit his end-of-month fundraising goal before Monday. Can you donate today?

I won't sugarcoat it -- our final FEC deadline before the election is right around the corner, and we need your help to hit our fundraising goal. Unlike Harley's opponent, our campaign isn't funded by Big Money and corporate special interests. Instead, we rely on small-dollar donations from hard working folks like you.

Our race is one of the most competitive races in the entire country. In fact, Inside Elections even named it the most competitive race in all of Orange County.

Hi Alex -- it's Kaira, Harley's wife. I'm just reaching out to see how your Halloween is going and tell you a little about ours. This Halloween is a bit different than years past: our kids are grown, trick-or-treaters will be sparse, and Harley's election is in just three days. But, truthfully, it feels like a scarier Halloween than any I ever remember having. There are so many things at stake for this election, both in CA-48 and across the country, and truthfully I feel scared of what will happen if people like Harley's opponent are elected. So, this Halloween, I hope you can enjoy the holiday's spookiness and also help us end the real spookiness on November 3rd by donating to Harley's campaign. Can you do that? I've seen Harley's opponent put people's lives on the line during this coronavirus crisis, and it's honestly terrifying. She's supposed to be leading our county as our top official, yet she's going to maskless events and began this pandemic implying masks could be dangerous. It's hard seeing Harley with those same fears for our district and knowing that there's a real possibility his opponent could unseat him and take her policies and beliefs to the Capitol. I want to make sure that doesn't happen. Can you help me by donating to Harley's campaign today?

Hi! It's Nicole, Harley's finance director. I'm just emailing you because we need your help if we're going to hit our end of the month fundraising goal. With the election only months away, we're extremely aware that not only are we running in one of the most competitive districts in California, but we're running against one of the most well-funded campaigns in the country. That's why your help goes such a long way. Your support can help us show that we're keeping this seat blue. Can you donate today? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Harley is the only Democrat who has ever held this seat -- and he's been one of the most legislatively productive freshman members since taking office.

Our end-of-month fundraising deadline is in just hours. With mail-in ballots being delivered in just over a month, hitting our goal this month will be a huge part of determining how many people we can reach with Harley's message before they return their ballots. Hitting our August fundraising goal is critical since all of Orange County will be able to vote by mail this year instead of going to packed polling places on Election Day. So, can you donate right now to our campaign? This election is one of the most competitive races in the entire country. Period. POLITICO has called our race a "toss-up" and Inside Elections thinks it's the most competitive race in Orange County. That means we have just over a month to convince enough Orange County voters to mail in their ballots for Harley -- and it won't necessarily be easy.

We are officially only ten weeks from Election Day. That means we only have a few more major fundraising deadlines before this race is decided. Monday marks one of those major deadlines: it's one of our very last end-of-month fundraising deadlines. And we really need your help if we're going to hit our goal. Can you donate today? The Republican National Convention solidified that the Party's unifying around Trump -- and we all know Michelle Steel will continue to stand in lockstep with Trump. This election could be generation-defining. We can't let Trump appointees take office and steer our country towards a Trump agenda. That's why we really need you to donate before Monday.

Hi Alex, we're only four days away from Election Day. Four days! Alex, let me tell you, this time I feel just as nervous about Election Day as the last (and last time I was a challenger in a seat that had never been held by a Democrat!). I'm not just nervous about losing my position -- I'm nervous because the person I'm running against says things and does things that jeopardize lives and rights.

Happy Halloween! Today's supposed to be the spookiest day of the year, but you know as well as I do that this year has been full of spookiness. There may be fewer haunted houses and scary Halloween gatherings, but I think this year takes the cake (or the trick-or-treat loot!) for scariest one on record. That's, in large part, because the election is in just three days, and up and down the ballot there are races that could define the trajectory of our country for generations \-- including mine.

Harley's asked his opponent for a debate. In several different ways. And multiple times. Her campaign still hasn't said a thing about it. We sent another letter to her team today letting them know that Harley's going to be available on August 30th at 6pm in Newport Beach for a debate -- whether or not she decides to actually come debate him. This is where we need your help: will you sign on to our petition to urge Michelle to show up for the debate? Our elected officials are expected to debate. That's just part of the job description and why it's so surprising that in the midst of many crises and with fewer than 75 days until the election, she's remaining completely silent.

Some of you probably saw Harley and me questioning Postmaster General Louis DeJoy about the USPS on Monday -- and you probably also saw how flummoxed he was by some of our most basic questions. Our elected and appointed officials should know their jobs inside and out -- that's what taxpayers pay us for. As one of my neighboring members, I know Harley well. And, I know that when I question him about what's happening to small business owners in Costa Mesa or how climate change is affecting our Orange County beaches or how the district is handling the coronavirus response, he knows exactly what's going on. We need to keep leaders like that in the House. That's why I'm asking if you can donate to Harley's campaign today? We're less than 70 days from Election Day, and Harley is in one of the most competitive races in the entire country.

Hi there -- our end-of-quarter deadline is tonight at midnight -- and, in all honesty, hitting our goal is an essential step towards giving our grassroots campaign the momentum we need to keep this seat blue on Election Day. That's why I have to ask: can you donate to our campaign today? We know this race isn't going to be easy. It wasn't easy in 2018 when Harley became the first Democrat to win this seat ever. And it won't be easy today. Corporate special interest groups are flooding our race with Big Money, POLITICO has rated our race a toss-up, and Republicans make up the majority of our district. That's why donations from folks like you are so important. They help us reach the undecided voters in Orange County who could ultimately help determine who wins this race.

Kamala Harris made history yesterday. She's the first woman of color to join the presidential ticket of a major party -- ever. And this is just the start.

Alex -- I just wanted to make sure you saw that the OC Register endorsed Harley? This is huge news -- he's the only Democratic congressional candidate in Orange County to receive an endorsement from the Register. For all we know about our opponent's history of mishandling crises, making homophobic statements, and following Trump's every move, we can't be too surprised. But, on top of all of that, their endorsement of Harley also shows just how unprepared Michelle Steel is. Check it out ⬇️ The OC Register is just the latest of a flurry of endorsements from major organizations across the district and country, including from the US Chamber of Commerce, the International Association of Fire Fighters, and the Asian American Action Fund.

Hi there. My campaign team has been keeping me in the call time room in the moments I'm not on the House floor to make sure that we hit our end of month fundraising goal, so I haven't been able to write as many emails.

Thank you. Monday marked our end-of-month deadline, and, with your help, we hit our fundraising goal. That means a lot -- especially right now. Hitting our goal this month means we'll have the funds needed to reach critical voters before Election Day, including the many Orange Countians who will be voting by mail before November 3rd. It also means that we have a solid base of fundraising that we can use to compete with our special interest-backed opponent. I don't take any of this for granted. I know that every single donation represents your belief in my ability to justly and fairly represent you in Congress. I truly hope to live up to that belief. So, thank you again for all of your support. I couldn't do this without you. Sincerely, \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Alex -- I want to make this brief and to the point: we really need your support today. Here's why: 1) There are 99 days until Election Day! That means we need to increase our fundraising right now. 2) Our end of the month deadline is Friday. Hitting our monthly fundraising goal will send the message that Harley's not going to back down. 3) Harley's opponent, Michelle Steel, brought in over $1 million last quarter. With Big Money, the NRCC, and her own deep pockets all funding her campaign, we can expect that she'll keep having huge fundraising performances. What do you say: can you give now?

Hey there! It's Nicole, Harley's finance director. With only 19 days until the election, you can bet that I'm keeping my eye on how many small dollar donations we're bringing in and how many big checks our opponent is raking in. So, when I got the FEC notification just minutes ago that Michelle Steel's Q3 numbers were in and saw that she's given herself 1.7 million dollars over the course of this campaign, you can imagine just how motivated I became to show her that we can still beat her with our small dollar donors. But, that's why I've got to ask you: can you pitch in just a few dollars to our campaign right now? Yeah -- you read that right. She's given herself 1.7 million dollars. So, I really mean it when I say that we need every single one of you to pitch in something to help us meet a massive haul like that. Can you help us get there by donating today? Thanks for being part of our grassroots team! \-- Nicole LeClerc, Finance Director Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hey -- it's Alyssa, Harley's campaign manager. I'm reaching out because Harley's on his way to meet Michelle for their debate. However, it's unlikely she'll even turn up. We want to show Harley that, even though his opponent is refusing to engage, we still think he's doing the right thing by trying to facilitate a debate. That's why we're going to try to flood him with donations for the rest of the night -- it'll be the perfect way to show him that we support his effort and to help us reach our end-of-month fundraising goal. Will you donate right now to our campaign? Harley's opponent is doing everything she can to get out of debating Harley. She even just tried to blame her absence on the fact that a local Democratic group is going to be watching the debate. We've already told her that we're trying to make this as fair as possible, but she won't even engage the possibility of a debate. Will you show Harley you support his call for a fair debate by donating today? Thanks for being with us! \-- Alyssa, Campaign Manager Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Alex -- the election is in fewer than eight weeks, and we've got some updates for you: 1\. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican Super PAC, just injected over a million dollars to this race -- almost all of which is going directly to attack ads against Harley. 2\. The NRA just endorsed Harley's opponent and gave her an "A" grade, while giving Harley an "F." That's because Harley is going to go out on a limb to protect our students and communities from gun violence, even when it means being targeted by the gun lobby and the NRA. 3\. This race is still ranked a "toss-up" by POLITICO and named the most competitive race in all of Orange County by Inside Elections. That means we need your help right now.

Hi Alex -- I'm reaching out a few hours before our critical end-of-quarter deadline to let you know why your donation right now will go such a long way. We're in one of the most competitive districts in the entire country. In fact, our 2018 underdog victory was the first win by a Democrat in the district ever, and there are more Republicans in this district than Democrats. It only makes sense that POLITICO calls our race a "toss-up," and Inside Elections has named it the most competitive in Orange County. We're also in one of the most crucial times of the campaign. Voters will receive their mail-in ballots in just days, so now is our chance to share my message with undecided voters. And the consequences of this race will reverberate throughout Orange County. My opponent is threatening the ACA, women's rights, LGBTQ equality, and gun control. So, when I say that your donation right now is really important, I mean it. Can you donate today?

Hi Alex, it's true. I do have a confession to make -- and it's exactly what our latest video ad is all about. I've forwarded my team's email so you can check it out.

Donald Trump came to Orange County yesterday, cheering on masses of people who took to the streets to see him and hosting a high-roller fundraiser despite COVID spiraling out of control across the country. Michelle Steel, who is supposed to oversee our response to this deadly virus, was absolutely silent about the president's visit. But, this is nothing new. She's said nothing in the face of countless Trump offenses. We need someone who will actually stand up for what's right, even when it goes against party wishes. That's why we need to re-elect Harley Rouda. Can you help us do that by donating today? We can't be all too surprised Michelle Steel didn't say anything about Trump's super-spreader event in Orange County. She's done this all too many times before! She was silent when Trump called our military heroes "losers," she said nothing when Trump tried to take away health care for those with pre-existing conditions, and she didn't say a thing when he said he was purposefully understating the coronavirus. We need someone to represent us who will actually use their voice. That's why I'm asking: can you donate to Harley's re-election campaign today?

Alex, Throughout Orange County and the nation, the effects of the coronavirus have rattled our communities and revolutionized our conception of work. For some folks, that's meant responding to life-threatening emergencies every single day. For others, it's been teaching students over Zoom for the first time ever. And, for a lot of folks, that's meant being laid off and forced to search for work in a time of global economic uncertainty. In this context, Labor Day has a powerful and distinct meaning. It's understanding the role of labor in the context of our own lives, as well as its role in our communities. So, I hope you also put aside some time today to reflect upon how this pandemic has affected the jobs and livelihoods of people across our county and our nation. And, I also hope you spend some of your time enjoying the holiday and safely cooling off from the heat. Happy Labor Day! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hey Alex -- I just wanted to see if you saw Alyssa's email from yesterday (forwarded below). I've been asking my opponent to join me for a debate for weeks now, and she hasn't said anything about it. Debates are a critical way for voters to see where candidates stand on issues and how they differ from each other. And debates don't end with the campaign -- they're a major part of my duties on Capitol Hill. That's why I'm shocked that my opponent won't even acknowledge our request -- and we can be pretty sure that she's gotten the message. Can you join me in calling on Michelle to join us for a debate? Thank you! \-- Harley \---------- Forwarded message --------- Harley's asked his opponent for a debate. In several different ways. And multiple times. Her campaign still hasn't said a thing about it. We sent another letter to her team today letting them know that Harley's going to be available on August 30th at 6pm in Newport Beach for a debate -- whether or not she decides to actually come debate him. This is where we need your help: will you sign on to our petition to urge Michelle to show up for the debate? Our elected officials are expected to debate. That's just part of the job description and why it's so surprising that in the midst of many crises and with fewer than 75 days until the election, she's remaining completely silent. Will you sign our petition to demand that Michelle agree to a debate? Thanks for signing on! \-- Alyssa, Campaign Manager Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

I've always known this is going to be a competitive race. No matter how long I'm in Congress, it will probably always be competitive -- because this is just a tough district to win in for a Democrat. But, newspapers all over the place, from the LA Times to the New York Times to even The Independent in the UK, are now reiterating that we're in for a nail-biter. So, I'm nervous. Especially because this race has huge consequences for people in Orange County and across the country. Can you help me secure two more years in Washington by donating today? We've got a lot on the line this election. Fundamental rights and basic safety could be stripped away if my opponent wins this race. So, I'm coming to you now, the day before Election Day, to ask if you can donate $20 to my re-election campaign. Can you donate today?

We all know who we look to when we want coronavirus guidance. Spoiler alert: it's usually not our president. Anthony Fauci has been our most reliable source of guidance on how to fight this pandemic since day one. And, we can't let Trump shuffle blame to him just to save face. Can you sign on to show Dr. Fauci that you're supporting him? Dr. Fauci has made sure to prioritize health and safety since the very start of this pandemic. In large part, he's why we've been able to save as many lives as we have saved. But, we all know Trump has been sputtering whatever guidance he feels like will benefit him on that day -- jeopardizing millions of lives across the country and contributing to the US having one of the highest death tolls in the entire world. We need to show Fauci he has our support. Can you do that by signing on today? Thank you for taking part! \-- Team Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Hi Alex, I'm just quickly reaching out to let you know that there are only ten days until this election is over, and we're going to have to keep fighting up until the moment polls close. I'll tell you why: Republicans still outnumber Democrats in the district, and now radical right special interest groups are throwing their weight behind my opponent because she'll rubber stamp their out of touch policies. I know it's not going to be easy to keep this seat. But, that's all the more reason to fight tooth-and-nail until we win this race. We simply can't afford to let up. I know we can do this.

Like so many of you, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death left me stunned and deeply saddened. She was a force of a justice and a woman -- someone who was relentless in her pursuit of justice and grounded by her sense of right. She led a life striving towards making our country a better and fairer place up until her last breath. Her death also left me scared. Scared because I know that this administration will choose short-term political gain over precedent, political process, and a sense of right. And that decision could alter our lives and freedoms for generations. Ruth Bader Ginsburg lived her entire life in search of the good -- for all Americans. Now, it's our time to continue her path and make this election a referendum on what's right. That's why I'm encouraging you: vote, vote, vote. This is your opportunity to make your voice heard. If you need convincing, just look at how much has happened in these past four years. And, if you can, sign up to volunteer! Yes, we would love for you to volunteer for our campaign (and you can do so here!), but if you can't volunteer for us, volunteer for another campaign. Ruth Bader Ginsburg irreversibly changed our country. The opinions she wrote will impact our grandchildren's grandchildren. But, we too have the chance to direct our country's future for generations -- just as she did. That's why I'm begging you not to give up this opportunity. Please do whatever you can to make our country a better place before November 3rd. None of us wants to wake up on November 4th and regret not doing more. You really can make a difference, and together, we will get it done. Thank you! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

Here's the deal: we have less than 80 days until Election Day, and we can't go out and reach voters the way we normally do. So, we're mixing things up. We're going to need everyone (and we mean everyone) to wear Harley shirts, use Harley masks, and rep Harley signs. We're also going to need to spend big on TV and digital ads to spread Harley's message. You can help us meet both of those goals by donating $25 or more to our campaign today and receiving a shirt, sign, or mask in return! Can you donate $25 today? This is the perfect time to give to the campaign -- because who doesn't like an extra gift with their donation? But, we're starting to run low, so you'll have to act quickly!

Since the get-go, our opponent has made it crystal clear she has no interest in debating Harley -- even though that's one of the most important ways voters get to know what the candidates stand for. We're left grasping at straws why she's not giving Orange Countians a chance to see her take on some of our most pressing issues. But, Seinfeld's Jason Alexander helped moderate a "debate" between Harley and Michelle, using her previous statements about critical questions. We think it shows you just how important it is to make absolutely certain Harley's elected in five days, but we'll let you be the judge. Will you watch the clip and then donate to our campaign? Michelle Steel has spread dangerous anti-mask rhetoric, promoted homophobic views, and wants to repeal the ACA. You can even hear it for yourself in our "debate"! Let's be clear: these are bigoted, dangerous statements. And they aren't for the good of California's 48th district. They're good for the radical right and its special interest allies. We need your help right now to protect CA-48 by re-electing Harley. Can you donate today? Five more days! \-- Alyssa Napuri, Campaign Manager Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress. In 2018, Harley defeated the 30-year incumbent Dana Rohrabacher in the very first political campaign of Harley's life. During his time in Congress, he's embraced common sense and values to tackle climate change, address deteriorating infrastructure, confront homelessness, and protect Social Security and Medicare. In 2020, Harley will be facing one of the toughest re-election fights in the entire country, so he's depending on the support of grassroots individuals.

Sean Casten for Congress Folks, I can think of nothing crueler than working to strip people of their health care while our nation battles a global pandemic. But unfortunately, President Trump is as devoid of empathy as he is of common sense -- and Republican politicians are too busy trying to score political points to stand up for the 23 million Americans who could lose coverage if his all-out assault on the Affordable Care Act succeeds. We will never be able to contain this virus if people don’t have access to the affordable health care they need -- which is why I’m proud to have voted for the House-passed Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act to lower health care costs and prescription drug prices. Protecting the health of Americans and their loved ones can’t wait -- but Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans won’t take this up without massive grassroots pressure. I still need 1,783 citizen co-sponsors to sign on to demand the Senate bring the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act up for a vote >> Add Your Name If Trump’s lawsuit to strike down the ACA succeeds, over 600,000 Illinoisans would lose coverage and over 5 million Illinoisans with pre-existing conditions could face higher premiums or be denied coverage altogether. We can’t let that happen. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act would build off of the progress of the ACA to expand coverage, combat health coverage inequities faced by communities of color, crack down on junk plans, and strengthen protections for pre-existing conditions. At a time when millions are afraid for the health of themselves and their loved ones, and millions more are unemployed and uninsured, our government has a responsibility to take care of its people. Add your name to call on the Senate to swiftly pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act!

Michiganders can disagree and still have respect for one another. However you feel about the current stay-at-home orders, we all can agree that people should never threaten violence to intimidate or make their point. While lawmakers should be focused on responding to this pandemic, the Michigan State Legislature instead had to cancel its legislative session to avoid the threat of armed protesters. As we continue to deal with COVID-19, I get that Michiganders are frustrated. I, too, am frustrated by this global pandemic. Like you, I want everything to return to normal – and for people to return to work – as soon as it’s safe to do so. But threatening the safety of others, to prevent them from doing their work, is wrong. Now is not the time for partisanship. For us to get through this, we must remember that the enemy is the coronavirus, not each other. During times of crisis, America has persevered when we stood together. In order for us to protect public health and defeat this deadly virus, we have to use common sense, respect science and listen to medical experts. Their advice is to continue practicing social distancing, wearing a cloth mask if you have to leave your home and staying at home when you’re sick. People have a constitutional right to protest. This includes the right to carry signs with hateful slogans and swastikas, and wave confederate flags. You can carry semi-automatic weapons inside our State Capitol. And you can even exercise these constitutional rights against the expense of your own health, and the health of the police officers there to protect you. While Michiganders have those rights, we also have the right to speak out against that behavior, and stand with the vast majority of Michiganders who do not agree with their actions. The protesters in Lansing have been unsafe for so many reasons, and disturbing to watch. Their actions are putting every Michigander, and every community across our state, at risk. We should be working together to find ways to help and protect our fellow Michiganders. We also need to face the facts: Michigan is one of the states with the most deaths due to COVID-19. Our Governor is taking difficult – but necessary – actions to slow the spread of this deadly virus. Together, we will get through this. I’m going to continue focusing on my work in Congress to pass legislation that helps to minimize the health and economic impact of this pandemic for all Michiganders. Dan Congressman Dan Kildee – a Flint native – is proud to represent Michigan’s Fifth District. As a Democratic party leader, Dan is fighting hard to ensure every American has access to quality health care, clean water and a good-paying job. The path to protect the Democratic majority in the House runs right through the Midwest, and as Heartland Engagement Chair, Dan's job is to protect and elect Democratic candidates.

Thoughts and tweets don't save lives, but action does. Friend, I wanted to make sure that you saw the news: I'm honored to be endorsed by Brady -- one of our nation's most important organizations dedicated to reducing gun violence. Thoughts and tweets don't save lives, but action does. That's why I've been working in Congress every single day to pass common sense solutions to stem gun violence in our country. Special interests like the NRA are pushing back hard. They don't want to see us making progress in Washington, D.C., and I have no doubt they'll be investing in my opponents in an attempt to stop our progress in its tracks. Help show that we're demanding action on gun violence by making a contribution to our campaign today. Chip in to show we're demanding action now -- and we won't let special interest groups like the NRA stop us. CHIP IN » One of the first actions I took as a member of Congress was cosponsoring a bill for universal background checks. I've been calling for additional actions, like reinstating the assault weapons ban and keeping guns away from domestic abusers, overdue steps that will save lives. Fixing this problem will not be easy, but I'm heartened by the countless activists here in Minnesota's 3rd and around the country -- students, parents, teachers, and so many more -- who are raising their voices on this issue every day. Change will require all of us coming together, regardless of party, to create policies that work to keep every neighborhood, school, and community safe. I won't stop working until we solve this issue. But I can't do it alone. Join me in celebrating this big endorsement: Chip in to help us win in 2020 and continue demanding courage, action, and real solutions to combat gun violence in America.

We are facing unprecedented challenges with the COVID-19 pandemic, and it’s more important now than ever that we have leaders in our community who are putting the health, safety, and well-being of our hard-working families first. As a state senator, I’ve been working with local and state leaders to expand access to testing, provide more resources for health care and frontline workers, and support our local economy as we weather this crisis. Now, I’m hoping to take my results-driven approach and make an even greater impact for our community, which is why I’m running for Congress. People in Missouri are tired of business as usual in Washington. Partisan bickering has become the unfortunate norm, even in times of crisis. But throughout my career, I’ve worked with people with whom I don’t always agree to find common ground to get things done. That is what I’ve always done, and that’s what I’ll continue to do in Congress. If we’re going to flip MO-02 blue in November, I’ll need people like you by my side.

There are a lot of problems Congress can fix if we work together and use common sense. Friends and Neighbors, I am so excited to share our newest ad with you, explaining what inspired me to roll up my sleeves and run for school board. You can click here to watch it and, if you’re able, pitch in a few dollars to keep it on the air. Watch our ad » Now, I never planned to run for office. But Friend, when I saw my sons and their teachers sweating in 98 degree classrooms and the school board refusing to take action, I knew I had to do something. It’s just common sense -- if we want our children to be able to learn, we need to give them the best environment to do so. So I ran for school board and I won. Not only did we get the schools air conditioned, but we got all 6 of my campaign priorities accomplished. This story is important because too often, politicians come around asking for your vote for the wrong reasons. Serving on my local school board and the city council, I found that if you’re willing to roll up your sleeves and work together, you can actually get a lot done for people. This common-sense approach helped me in Jefferson City, where every bill I passed has had bipartisan support. And in Congress, you can trust that I will always work to find common ground on the issues that matter most to Missourians. We’re coming up on our end-of-month fundraising deadline in just a few short days, and we still need to raise $15,000 from our grassroots supporters online to keep our ad on the air and continue reaching voters. If you’re able, will you consider chipping in any amount now to help us meet this important fundraising goal?

Let me explain why I’m supporting Jill We hope you enjoy this longer note from Mayor Harold Dielmann, a lifelong Republican who was mayor of Creve Coeur, Missouri for 28 years, on why he supports Jill. If you don’t have time to read it all (that’s okay!), will you consider chipping in any amount to help Jill reach her most important fundraising deadline to date so she can win this TOSS-UP race? Donate now » Friend, Today, my friend Jill Schupp is taking a day of reflection to observe Yom Kippur, so I wanted to use the opportunity to reach out and explain why, as a lifelong Republican, I am supporting Jill this year in her race to represent Missouri’s Second District.  I served with Jill when I was Mayor of Creve Coeur, Missouri, and she was on the City Council. I have seen Jill in action firsthand, and when she wants to get something done, nothing can stand in her way. From my time working with Jill, I know that she is a consensus-builder and works well with other people, and this shows clearly in her record. In fact, every bill Jill has passed in the legislature has had bipartisan support. I know Jill can bring back common sense to our government and that she’ll work hard for real solutions to the challenges facing Missourians. Friend, believe me when I say that for Jill, it’s not about a political party, it’s about doing what’s best for people. That’s why I say Jill Schupp is a people candidate, not a party candidate. I’ve been a Republican all my life -- that’s 90 years. I am proud to support Jill in this election, but I know she has a tough fight ahead in these final weeks. She has a very important fundraising deadline coming up in just a few days, so I would appreciate it if you would consider chipping in to help her win this race so she can go to Washington and get things done for Missouri families.

Alex – It's no secret that the United States puts too many people in jail and prison. Our criminal justice system keeps many people locked up far too long; these sentences don't deter future criminal behavior, and often make it harder for people to reenter society as productive citizens. We need major reform now. That's why I'm supporting Mike Schmidt for Multnomah County District Attorney. Mike Schmidt Criminal justice reform is a difficult and complex effort, and no one can make it happen alone. But an enlightened District Attorney is the single most important person to make sure that effort succeeds. Our DA decides the guidelines for prosecution, giving them wide discretion over the flow of people in and out of the criminal justice system. Over five years running the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission, Mike showed he has the values, temperament, and above all, the judgment to manage the tremendous power of the office. In a system where a simple decision can have profound consequences for justice, Mike will balance critical public safety concerns with fundamental fairness, common sense, and equity. The race for District Attorney rarely gets the attention it deserves, but this year, there is no more important vote we will cast for our local government. And because Mike Schmidt will approach the job with compassion, intelligence, and integrity, he has my full confidence.

Alex Morse for Congress - Friend, This week we launched our virtual town hall series to connect with communities throughout the district and update our neighbors on the coronavirus response our local, state, and federal governments have implemented. In Easthampton we discussed the lack of resources and support provided by our federal government, and what real people-focused leadership looks like. Alex also dropped off the first batch of nomination signatures at the Secretary of State’s office. This is a milestone for our movement and a sure sign of the momentum we have built and are building! While we have focused our energy on organizing in the district, the stakes of our campaign have never been more clear. Just this week we saw Congressman Neal use his authority as Chair of Ways and Means to block the Paycheck Guarantee Act, a common sense solution that would help working class people at a time when unemployment is its worst since the Great Depression. Alex understands the impacts poor policies and representation have had on our communities. I believe that Alex will fight for our communities and our district, just as he fights for Holyoke. I trust that Alex will be a voice for our concerns, our needs, and our dreams for a better future. And that is why I was proud to join his campaign for Congress and help him build a true grassroots, people-powered movement. Alex is running to represent every person in the First District. So as we start thinking seriously about what the next phases of this crisis will look like, and about the policies that will shape our nation's recovery, I want people like Alex at the table. We deserve authentic leadership representing our interests in Congress. If you can afford to, make a contribution today to help build our momentum as we get closer to our election in just 17 short weeks. Donate $10 → Every contribution helps us grow this movement, and brings us one step closer to winning this race and being able to implement big, bold solutions.

Faith leaders are calling for a statewide day of prayer today as the Kansas House of Representatives debates the Value Them Both Amendment. Friend, This morning I’m at the National Prayer Breakfast in our nation's capital, a great opportunity for leaders, public servants and Americans to gather in a bipartisan manner to pray for this nation and our people. In Kansas, faith leaders are also calling for a statewide day of prayer today. As you are reading this email, state lawmakers in Topeka are debating the Value Them Both Amendment to the Kansas Constitution. This is a common sense amendment that gives the power of regulating abortion back to the people of Kansas and the state legislature, not the courts. Ever since the Kansas Supreme Court "found" the right to an abortion in our state's 158-year-old governing document in 2019, all of Kansas' pro-life laws could be dismantled. The proposed amendment makes it clear – "Kansans value both women and children." The debate and vote in the Kansas House of Representatives this week will determine whether Kansans can vote on this critical amendment this fall. The Kansas Constitution states that “all political power is inherent in the people.” Truly it is our people, not our government institutions or black-robed policymakers, that have the power here in the Sunflower State. It should be without question that the people of Kansas deserve to vote on this pivotal issue and define the landscape of human dignity for the next chapter in our state. So as you go throughout your busy day, please take a moment to stop and pray. Pray for the unborn who are innocent in this tragedy, for the young mothers who are facing challenging circumstances, for the doctors and nurses who are participating in this destructive practice, for Gov. Laura Kelly, for this nation – that we would genuinely be a culture that values life – and pray for our State Representatives as they take up the Constitutional Amendment today. Sincerely, Rep.

I just wanted to give you a quick update from the campaign trail. Friend, I just wanted to give you a quick update from the campaign trail. The month of August began with Kansas' Primary Election. The final votes were certified by the Kansas Secretary of State's office on Friday. Thanks to Republicans like you, Ron received 87,877 votes! The month ended with a great RNC convention where Republicans talked about hope for our country and the greatness of America. It was a stark contrast to the doom and gloom of the Democrat's convention the week before. And today we end our August fundraising deadline. So many Kansans have stepped up to ensure that we send our Kansas Champion back to Washington this fall. We know he is working hard every day on our behalf, bringing his engineering background and common sense solutions to a dysfunctional Congress under Speaker Pelosi. If you haven't yet donated to the campaign, or you have but are ready to give more, today is the day! Your contribution of $25, $50 or even $100 will help us meet our midnight goal and give us strength as we move into the final months of the election.

Take my quick survey on last night's speech before the Senate votes to acquit President Trump today. Friend, Did you watch the State of the Union last night? ALL Americans are benefiting from the common sense policies of President Trump, and his message was uplifting and encouraging. He talked about our booming economy that has driven unemployment down and confidence up. He shared the progress on securing our border and taking out terrorist leaders like al-Baghdadi and Qasem Soleimani. And the president encouraged Congress to work with him on lowering prescription drug prices, advancing school choice and protecting the unborn. Unfortunately, there was a classless twist after the speech: Speaker Pelosi actually ripped up the transcript in the House chamber! We've seen the left's hatred increase over the last three years, but to show such disrespect for the president and the American people is beyond belief. However, I know that you stand with our president and not the left's radical agenda. Before the Senate acquits the president later today, will you take just a minute to respond to a single-question survey below? I want to hear what you thought about last night's State of the Union. And when you're done, consider contributing so that we can ensure that when President Trump gives his State of the Union next year, Nancy Pelosi isn't sitting behind him. Sincerely, Rep. Ron Estes State of the Union Survey Question: Do you agree with President Trump's State of the Union? YES! I agree with President Trump's message and policies! No, I don't agree with President Trump.

Friend, This year we have one extra day in February, which is a good thing because we are just shy of meeting our February goal. While Democrats are still doing everything they can to undermine President Trump, Republicans are working for you, the American people. Just this week, Democrats voted against two common sense pro-life bills in the Senate, used the coronavirus as a political issue by sowing division and unnecessary hysteria, and their presidential frontrunner complimented Cuba's Castro in an interview. It's clear – we have to defeat the radical left in November. But to ensure that we have the resources to keep the White House and take back the House, I need your support. On this last day of February, consider donating $29 to help us meet our February goal. Contribute $29 Now >> We are close, and if 20 people contribute $29 today, we'll surpass our goal.

Today Ron filed for re-election at the Secretary of State's office in Topeka! We wanted to forward you the press release we just sent! Friend, We wanted to forward you the press release we just sent! Today Ron filed for re-election at the Secretary of State's office in Topeka! You can read about it below. The race for 2020 is on! Will you help us with a donation today of $20.20? We're ready to send our Kansas champion back to our nation's capital, and we know he would appreciate your support. Team Estes RUSH IN $20.20 \---------- Forwarded message --------- From: Estes Campaign Press Reply-To: Estes Campaign Press Date: Tuesday, May 7, 2020 at 5:56 PM To: Team Estes Subject: Rep. Ron Estes Files for Re-election For Immediate Release: May 7, 2020 Rep. Ron Estes Files for Re-election TOPEKA – Today U.S. Rep. Ron Estes filed for re-election to serve Kansas’ 4th Congressional District with the Kansas Secretary of State’s office in Topeka. Estes was first elected to Congress in an April 2017 special election. He handily won re-election in 2018, winning by nearly 20 points. “It’s been an honor to serve south central Kansans in our nation’s capital, and the current pandemic is a reminder that we need common sense leadership in Congress,” said Estes. “As I return home to Wichita each week, Kansans share their concerns and values with me that I take back to Washington.” Since being elected, Rep. Estes has been a champion for Kansas families, workers, small businesses, farmers and veterans. Following his swearing-in, he defeated air traffic control privatization that would have been harmful to the general aviation industry, strongly supported the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that put money in the pockets of hardworking Kansans, led the charge for HHS to implement the Protect Life Rule which prevented abortion providers from receiving Title X Family Planning tax dollars, was named to the USMCA whip team to help push this critical trade deal across the finish line, reintroduced the Kelsey Smith Act, introduced the Down Syndrome Discrimination by Abortion Prohibition Act, and secured three additional KC-46 tankers. Rep. Estes was also named to the influential Ways and Means Committee in 2019, bringing his business and state treasurer background to the committee with jurisdiction over trade, taxes, health care and retirement security. Having served less than a full term at the time of his appointment, his quick selection to this critical committee for Kansas and the country displayed the respect his colleagues have for him. Additionally, outside organizations recognize Rep. Estes’ commitment to Kansas and his leadership in the House. Just last week, the Kansas Farm Bureau resoundingly endorsed Rep. Estes for re-election. He also just received a 97% rating from the American Conservative Union – the highest score of any member in the Kansas federal delegation. He’s also received the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Spirit of Enterprise award for his support of small and local businesses, the State Financial Officers Foundation Financial Freedom Award, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association Freedom to Fly award for his support of general aviation, and the Wheat Advocate Award from Kansas Wheat. Kansans are also showing support for Rep. Estes, with 75.6% of donations coming from Kansas – the most of any Kansas House member running for re-election. Rep. Estes has continued to show strong fundraising numbers each quarter with a broad base of support from throughout the District. At the end of the first quarter, Rep. Estes has raised more than $1.3 million in this election cycle and enters the second quarter with nearly $775,000 cash on hand. Thanks to his many supporters, Rep. Estes is committed to assisting conservative candidates on the ballot throughout south central Kansas. Top left: Rep. Estes files for re-election, May 7, 2020. Top right: Rep.

Estes and wife Susan support a Wichita-based restaurant in Topeka after the Kansas economy enters Phase One of reopening, May 7, 2020. Rep. Estes remains committed to the people of the 4th District and has a strong track record of assisting Kansans through robust constituent services. Since being sworn in, Rep. Estes’ staff has met with individuals and families to help them with the IRS, Veterans Affairs, Social Security, passport issues, and other federal agencies. Throughout the pandemic, he has ensured that his office is available to work with Kansans experiencing difficulties. His continued connection to this District during the COVID-19 pandemic has allowed him to better understand the current needs of his Kansas constituents and talk through solutions that benefit them now and as our country reopens. “Before the pandemic, we saw a robust economy that was focused on middle-class growth and truly was the envy of the world. A global pandemic that impacted nearly all nations has forced us to put that booming economy on hold,” said Estes. “The common sense, conservative policies that expanded our economy and created more opportunities for Americans before COVID-19 will be what propels our country into the future. While these are challenging times, I’ve never been afraid to tackle the issues facing our nation and will continue to bring Kansas common sense to Washington.” Rep. Estes is honored to serve the people of the 4th District in our nation’s capital and works hard every day on behalf of his fellow Kansans with the same strong work ethic he learned on the family farm. ### Twitter Facebook Website PAID FOR BY RON ESTES FOR CONGRESS Want to change how you receive these emails?

Jason for The Denver Post: "Create a national health force to put recent graduates to work" Support the Health Force NOW » Full text of the op-ed available at the bottom of this email. This plan is just plain common sense, friend. Countless hard-working Americans need jobs, and our health care system is in desperate need of additional trained workers. We need an ambitious, time-tested plan to help our nation recover -- and the Health Force is just that. The federally-supported, locally-managed program would help public health agencies across the nation train the employees they need to complement the work being done by remarkable medical professionals already fighting on the frontlines. The Health Force would be responsible for testing support, contact tracing efforts, eventual vaccine administration, public health data collection and education efforts, delivering food and medical supplies, and so much more. Once you've read Jason's op-ed below -- add your name to support the Public Health force today >> Thank you, Congressman Crow HQ Don't take our word for it! Here's what Jason and his colleagues have to say: "Create a national health force to put recent graduates to work" By Congressman Jason Crow, Congresswoman Diana DeGette, and Senator Michael Bennet The Denver Post, May 16, 2020 This month, millions of talented students will graduate during the nation's biggest challenge since the Great Depression. In the last eight weeks, over 36 million Americans have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. At the same time, health care systems across the nation are struggling under a once-in-a-century pandemic that has claimed over 86,000 lives. Like the generation of Americans who faced down the depression of the 1930s, we must propose ideas that match the scale of our challenges. That is why we have proposed a new "Health Force," the most ambitious public health initiative in our history. To safely reopen the country, experts tell us we need trained workers in every community to help test, conduct contact tracing, administer vaccines, and educate people about social distancing and self-isolation. At the same time, we must address the chronic underfunding of essential services that left our state and local public health departments short-staffed when we need them most. The Health Force would meet this urgent need by recruiting, training, and employing hundreds of thousands of Americans to surge our health care capacity on the front lines and help keep our economy open. Here's how it would work. The federal government would fund the Health Force at a cost of $55 billion a year for the first two years, with state, local, and tribal health agencies empowered to recruit, train, and manage the program with support from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The hundreds of thousands of newly-trained recruits would not only help us overcome this pandemic more quickly, they would also bolster our public health workforce for challenges to come. Some view this as a massive effort. They are right; the Health Force would be the most ambitious public health campaign in American history. But consider this: each day we remain closed, the economy loses another $20 billion. If the Health Force lets us reopen just 10 days earlier than we otherwise would, the program would pay for itself -- to say nothing of the long-term benefits of equipping hundreds of thousands of young people with the skills for lifelong careers in public health. History reminds us of what can happen when we take the longer view and embrace big ideas in moments of crisis. Generations ago, Americans answered the Great Depression with bold initiatives like the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps, which put thousands of Coloradans to work to meet urgent needs across our state. Today, we see the legacy of these programs in every corner of our state - from campgrounds, irrigation ditches, and infrastructure projects Coloradans helped clear, dig, and trench because we had the vision to ask them. There is no reason that, decades from now, we cannot leave a similar legacy from the Health Force -- in the thousands of tests and vaccines administered, the small businesses kept open, the lives saved, and a renewed commitment to public health across the country. The frequent comparison between this crisis and the Great Depression can be dispiriting. But it is incomplete. After all, in the wake of the Great Depression, America produced the Greatest Generation -- the men and women who liberated Europe, built the middle class, transformed our nation into a scientific and economic superpower, and forged a new world order. There is no reason why young people today cannot become the Greatest Generation of our time to help America in its moment of need. Our job is to ask them. Now more than ever, we need strong leaders like Jason working for you in Congress.

Alex, Corruption. Gun violence. Corruption. Skyrocketing healthcare costs. Corruption. Climate change. Did I mention corruption? Our country has faced a lot of issues that we need to tackle together. To solve these problems, we need leadership that cares about our community, not someone who is being bought and paid for by DC insider groups. We also need someone with some good, old fashioned common sense. Unfortunately, Ross Spano doesn't seem to have a lot of that. After the Parkland shooting in Florida, he was more concerned with declaring pornography a public health risk than ending the gun violence epidemic. In Congress, he voted against protecting people with pre-existing conditions, even though more than 7 million Floridians have them. And, in spite of living in a state where we see super storms, rising sea levels, and toxic algae blooms, he denies the existence of climate change. To top it all off, he's currently the only sitting member of Congress under criminal investigation because he accepted nearly $200,000 in illegal funds to win his last election. Alex, we need to elect someone who has just as much common sense as we do. Not someone who cares more about making wealthy donors happy than he does about tackling the real problems our district faces. When I'm in Congress, I'll fight for affordable healthcare, gun safety, renewable energy, and other common sense solutions. And you'll never see a headline that I'm under FBI investigation.

Alex, This election cycle is more important than ever for central Florida families. Everything from our healthcare to our environment is on the ballot this year, and we need to make sure we’re electing leaders who will work for working families -- not for Washington special interests. That’s why I’m proud to endorse Adam Hattersley for the U.S. House of Representatives. Will you join me in supporting Adam by splitting a donation between his campaign and mine today? As a state legislator, small business owner, and decorated war veteran, Adam would bring honor, experience, and common sense to Congress, and we need more of those qualities in our government right now. But more than anything, we need Adam in Congress because he’ll join us in putting people over politics and finding bipartisan solutions to the problems Florida families face -- from protecting our natural environment to making sure everyone can access the healthcare they need. Washington Republicans have their eyes on Florida. They want to defeat me and stop Adam from flipping his district, so we both need your help to fight back.

As America opens up, businesses need Washington’s help. Those that survived the pandemic now face a new outbreak: lawsuits. Without legal protections Image Give Small Businesses Liability Protection By Alfredo Ortiz, president and CEO of the Job Creators Network May 28, 2020 As published by Real Clear Politics. Facebook Twitter As America opens up, businesses need Washington’s help. Those that survived the pandemic now face a new outbreak: lawsuits. Without legal protections passed by Congress, businesses large and small will face a tidal wave of crippling litigation that will extinguish any hope of a successful recovery. McDonald’s, Tyson Foods and Smithfield Foods are already battling overzealous attacks by trial lawyers. Companies like these are big enough to weather the storm. But small businesses could be washed away if lawmakers fail to protect them. In fact, liability protections for U.S. businesses are the linchpin of America’s reopening. Factories, restaurants, and gymnasiums were abruptly shuttered to advance the cause of public health. They watched their revenues dry up. Many were forced to furlough or even fire their workers. Paying rent became a challenge. The federal government has stepped in by offering forgivable loans to help in the short term. But reopening is the only way to save these businesses over the long haul. Yet, as it stands, small businesses face the prospect of opening only to be shut down by frivolous lawsuits. If patrons catch the virus, for example, they can accuse business owners of inadequately shielding them. The result could be lawsuits -- which, let’s say it flatly, are greedy -- can close struggling businesses because they are unable to pay the lawyers’ costs alone. Many owners of small businesses say the mere threat of such legal complaints is preventing them from reopening at all. Trial lawyers argue that most Americans oppose giving businesses “guaranteed immunity.” But nobody is asking Congress to provide such blanket protection. Rather, businesses want Congress to limit liability to instances in which COVID-19 exposure results from provable neglect. No one, least of all America’s small- and mid-sized businesses, expects to be shielded from responsibility in cases where COVID-19 exposure resulted from reckless indifference to health concerns. At the same time, businesses must be protected from opportunistic and marauding lawyers. This is common sense. Businesses should not be persecuted for their inability to protect their customers or workers from contracting a disease as infectious as the novel coronavirus. As Sen. John Cornyn said recently: “It seems intuitive to me that if you’re a marginal small business and you’re making the decision whether to hang in there and try to survive ... or give up and either declare bankruptcy or just become insolvent ... this [liability protections] could make the difference." The senator is correct. He is also making a practical point. Additional legislation to address the severe economic impacts of the pandemic won’t make it through Congress to the president’s desk unless liability protections are included. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made that very clear. McConnell argues that when the government first asked businesses to shut down, Congress helped mitigate the economic risk by passing more than $2.6 trillion in economic support. Now that businesses are being asked to reopen, he says Congress is obliged to take the next step and reduce the legal risk to businesses by offering limited protection against frivolous lawsuits. It’s hard to deny the point. The Democrats have tried. Indeed, partisan tomfoolery stands in the way of McConnell’s common sense. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi calls McConnell’s drive for liability protections “disgraceful.” We disagree. Congress must rise above the all-too-familiar posturing and the Democrats’ fealty to trial lawyers to protect American businesses at this critical time. The do-nothing alternative that Pelosi prefers would be catastrophic for American businesses and the U.S. economy. Several states, such as Maryland and Illinois, have already implemented COVID-19-related liability protections for key industries, such as health care. But a broader, uniform law is needed. Small businesses, in particular, are vulnerable already. They don’t need to worry about litigation on top of everything else. Washington must step in and help. Congress should take strong action to stop frivolous lawsuits from getting in the way of what we all want and need: healthy citizens and a robust economy. ### Paid for by Texans for Senator John Cornyn This email was sent to [[EMAIL_REDACTED]].

Hi folks, This has been a trying time. George Floyd was laid to rest this week and peaceful protests continue across our nation. I spoke at a rally in Kelly Ingram Park in the shadow of Birmingham’s 16th Street Baptist Church, and I saw the pain in the faces of people who are tired of feeling unsafe in their own community and living in fear. SENATOR DOUGJONES ONE ALABAMA 3 Things From Doug Hi folks, This has been a trying time. George Floyd was laid to rest this week and peaceful protests continue across our nation. I spoke at a rally in Kelly Ingram Park in the shadow of Birmingham’s 16th Street Baptist Church, and I saw the pain in the faces of people who are tired of feeling unsafe in their own community and living in fear. I know full well that I don’t have all the words, but I know that it’s going to take all of us, working together to create real change. Words aren’t enough –- we need action. I abhor violence, and as much as we denounce looting and destruction of property, we need to denounce the inequities in our society which have caused these divisions with equal measure. I’ve been encouraged to see local leaders in Alabama working to address the concerns of the protesters and I hope to see more collective action, more people making their voices heard. It’s easy to lose sight of the fact that the coronavirus is still a serious problem in Alabama and much of the South. We must continue to practice social distancing and wear masks in public. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, but we can’t let up yet. I believe we can re-open our economy safely while protecting the health of our people. Please listen to the public health experts and stay vigilant. Just as these protests have shined a light on the disparities in the application of equal justice under the law, so too has the pandemic shown us the racial disparities in our health care system. We are seeing clearly now that our own health is dependent on our neighbors' health, and our economy is dependent on the health of our community. My commitment to expanding Medicaid in Alabama and protecting health coverage for our seniors and people with pre-existing conditions has never been stronger. – Doug Jones News Washington Post: John Lewis’s ‘good trouble’ of the 1960s resonates for today’s protests for racial justice WBHM: Birmingham’s Civil Rights History Front And Center At Rally For George Floyd Selma Times Journal: Jones pushes for state to be nation’s ‘health care manufacturing hub’ Cullman Tribune: Sen.

Friends, My name is Barbara Bollier, and I’m running for U.S. Senate in Kansas. I’m a physician, a wife, a mother, and a public servant. I’d like to take a few minutes to introduce myself and share a bit more about why I’m going to win this race. But before I do, I’m going to ask you to donate $5, $25, whatever you can spare, to help me reach tonight’s critical FEC fundraising goal. Let me start by saying: I used to be a Republican. I’ve been in Kansas politics since 2010, serving first in the Kansas House of Representatives, then in the State Senate. As a doctor, I’ve always looked at what the facts tell me, and tried to find common sense solutions to our problems. I earned a reputation as a leader who could work with folks on both sides of the aisle to deliver results. But I found that the Kansas Republican party was losing its way. In the State Senate, I was alienated for my support of reproductive rights, Medicaid expansion, and funding for K-12 schools. I was tired of the Kansas GOP’s hard-line rhetoric, its contempt for compromise, and its obsession with putting political power before children and families. When the Kansas GOP adopted anti-trans language as part of its party platform in 2018, I’d had enough. I could no longer be complicit as the Republican party became the party of extremism. I left the GOP, and I haven’t looked back. Republicans have held both Senate seats in my state since the Great Depression — but this year, we can change that. The latest polls have me leading my likely Republican opponent, Kris Kobach, by one point. And with the support of groups like EMILY’s List, End Citizens United, and 314 Action Fund, we’ll have the resources to flip this seat — and with it, flip the Senate. My campaign has our biggest fundraising deadline yet on June 30, and my team tells me we’re coming up short on our goal. Can I count on you to contribute $5, $25, $50, or whatever you can afford to help me WIN this race and flip the Senate?

Happy Father’s Day to the incredible men who have taken on one of the most challenging but rewarding experiences in life - being a father. I hope we can all take today to acknowledge the men in our lives who have been positive father figures. I’d like to take some time to talk about a man near and dear to me, my husband and the father of my children, Paul Hart. Paul and I have been married for almost 38 years and during that time, I have known him as a man who is always there for his friends and family. He has shown incredible loyalty in our marriage and commitment in raising our five children and continues to grow in his role as father and grandfather. Paul really loves his children and his grandchildren. I know that today he is looking forward to spending some virtual time with them. Like many of you, it’s been hard for Paul to be apart from them during this pandemic. “Pops,” as the grandkids call him, lives to make those four kiddos smile and laugh and watching him do that brings such joy to our lives. Paul is someone who brings the fun. He certainly knows how to tease me and makes me laugh when I really need a lift. He joins us on the road (when he can) and engages with constituents and campaign staff we meet along the way. Paul is especially known for giving staff the opportunity to drive a tractor when they need a break. I continue to learn from Paul every day. His common sense and his realistic way of looking at the world keep me focused on the things that matter in this campaign. Thank you for loving me, Paul, thank you for loving our children and grandchildren and thank you for giving me all the time and support you give as I work to represent this district. You are my biggest supporter and my very best friend. Happy Father’s Day, Paul. Thank you for everything you do! \--Rita Hart CONTRIBUTE Paid for by Rita Hart for Iowa Rita Hart for Iowa P.O.

I know y’all are ready for leadership that looks out for the rest of us. Stephen Daniel for Congress 2020 Alex, I’m running for Congress in Texas’s 6th District and I want to tell you why. Growing up in Itasca, my dad worked in a landfill and my mom worked at a video rental store. I grew up in a working-class family, and I’m running for Congress to fight for the working people of Texas. Join Us. Here in North Texas, one thing is for sure — our people are strong, hard-working, and committed to building a better life for our families. We deserve a leader in Congress who is fighting to make sure that opportunity is available for young and old and that hard work is rewarded. I raised my two daughters as a single dad. I believe that an honest day’s work should be enough to put food on the table, a roof over your head, and cover the cost of necessary medications. But unfortunately, that isn’t the case today. Washington, D.C. has gotten out of control — reason and common sense have completely vanished.

Thank you, Steve Contribute » * * * \------ Begin forwarded message ------ Subject: Where the Senate majority will be decided From: Newt Gingrich Date: Tuesday, May 5, 2020 From the Desk of Newt Gingrich Alex, Right now Senate Democrats are launching a full-scale assault on Trump Republicans in the hopes they can flip the majority this November. Together we can stop them, but it's vital we support Chuck Schumer's top target, Senator Steve Daines, before 11:59 PM TONIGHT. You see, the Left knows they only need to win four Senate seats in order to reclaim the majority and they also know how Montana votes, will determine whether their plan succeeds or fails. That's why both President Obama and Chuck Schumer threw their support behind Steve's liberal opponent and why they're pouring MILLIONS into his campaign war chest. Senator Daines is facing an uphill battle and it's critical we step up and help him win RIGHT NOW! Contribute » Steve is a fearless fighter for President Trump and his America First agenda. During the impeachment SCAM it was Steve who stood up for the President and demanded his swift acquittal. Now, as our country faces a global pandemic – it is once again Steve who is fighting tirelessly for the American people while also demanding China's incompetence to control the virus be held accountable. Make no mistake, Democrats have a real shot at winning the Senate this fall and we MUST do everything in our power to ensure STRONG Republicans, like Steve, win re-election and protect the majority. I know Steve is fighting for you and your family EVERY DAY. Will you join me and fight for him before 11:59 PM TONIGHT?

That's how much my Democratic opponents raised in the final days of 2019, mostly from liberal activists around the country who are determined to take me down. No Democratic candidate in South Carolina has ever raised so much money so early in an election cycle. Maybe it's because I stood up for Brett Kavanaugh – and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty – as Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee did their best to destroy a good man, while his family watched. Or maybe it's because I'm fed up with the Democrats' refusal to secure our southern border, which is causing a humanitarian and national security crisis. It could be any number of the common sense, conservative positions I've taken over the years, but of this I am certain: The Radical Left will say, do, or spend whatever it takes to defeat me.

You don’t need us to tell you to vote, so we won’t. We will, however ask you to check in on the folks you know in battleground states where the weather is shitty and the lines are long, and let them know you’re counting on them to power through and literally save America. Get them to promise you that they’ll do it. Let them know that their vote really, truly matters… even if they believe it only matters to you. Oh, and if you ever thought of dabbling in a little Chaos Magick, today is the day to use the IXNAY sigil in whatever way feels right to you. Yes, this really is a thing. But don’t take our word for it, check out The Daily Beast article below… Make one LAST donation to IXNAY ### The IXNAY sigil gets Election Day coverage in The Daily Beast. The Daily Beast’s Arvind Dilawar invites its readers to Meet the Witches Who Are Hexing Trump’s Re-Election, and drops a nice Hamlet reference in the process. Did we say readers? We mean paying readers. What is it with these greedy news organizations always wanting to raise money to cover overhead and pay staff? If you have the means, throw them a bone, but you’re in the IXNAY inner circle so we don’t feel bad about sharing our internal, archived version of the article with you here. Enjoy! Power the sigil with $$$ ### Witchcraft and Politics - an IXNAY Sigil Magick Special #### IXNAY Podcast Episode 13 #### Apple Podcasts Spotify Google Podcasts I've got no defense for it That heat is too intense for it What good would common sense for it do? Witchcraft. That coocoo witchcraft. While podcasts aren't normally described as action-packed, we've got a surprise for you today. We'll be offering a behind the scenes look at the making of the now-infamous IXNAY sigil and exploring the intersection of witchcraft and politics with some smart, interesting, and funny folks. First up the charming Professor Sabina Magliocco on the How's and Why's of sigil magic; then prolific author and world renowned expert of all things occult Gary Lachman with the historical who's and what ifs of conjuring up a world wide magical resistance; and last but hardly least the actual witches Shane Bugbee and Miss Lillian Lux who created and powered the IXNAY sigil. #### Click to LISTEN NOW Support IXNAY’s Lame Duck efforts ### Do you believe in magic? When it comes to defeating Donald Trump at the ballot box, we here at IXNAY PAC believe that all legal (and ethical) options are on the table. We've run commercials, started an informative podcast, run phone banking operations, engaged in street art campaigns, and sent thousands of handwritten postcards to undecided voters all in the hopes of ending our national nightmare. With time running out and as you’ve read above, we are trying one last thing: Witchcraft. For the first time in the history of American politics, a super PAC is utilizing witchcraft in a presidential election. IXNAY PAC has teamed up with transgressive artist and practitioner of the occult, Shane Bugbee, to create a "sigil” that will help bring about Donald Trump’s defeat at the polls. A sigil is a symbol that practitioners of chaos magic design to represent a desired outcome. Once charged, a sigil is traditionally put to work by experienced witches in elaborate rituals to plant the desire in a subconscious. However, it can just as easily be used by lay people who scrawl the symbol on walls, wear it on a shirt, or even share it via social media. Now, a super PAC forming a coalition of the witching might raise a few eyebrows but it’s just the sort of unholy alliance that people across the country need to be forming to end this disastrous presidency. The IXNAY sigil was first used in a ritual on Sunday, September 27, and since then has been discreetly passed around a tightly-knit network of witches around the world. Is it working? If you take a look at the state of the Trump campaign… the results speak for themselves. In the past weeks, we’ve been releasing video documentation of the sigil in its earliest ritual use as we seek to widen its use across the country. That’s right, we’re handing the sigil over to you, so you can create and share anti-Trump rituals of their very own using the hashtags #IXNAY & #IXNAYSIGIL. ### IXNAY SIGIL VIDEO: #### Trace Crutchfield talks about The IXNAY sigil and how you can participate #### WATCH NOW #### Witness Shane Bugbee riff on Trump’s own McDonald’s ritual in his “DC Fecal Contamination Curse” #### WATCH NOW #### Lillian Lux brings you expat witchcraft from Berlin in “A Blessing and a Curse” #### WATCH NOW Take the IXNAY sigil and run with it! The power here is yours, it's the power to rewrite your own horoscope day by day. In addition to using the sigil in your own rituals and sharing photos and video of them online, you can engage in political witchcraft through the simple act of making a donation to our campaign. Your dollars will serve as a force multiplier on the power of the sigil (and underwrite running pre-roll video of various IXNAY sigil rituals in front of Trump-related content on the web). The wider we can spread the word of this people-power campaign, the more people who use the sigil in their own rituals and share it with their friends, the stronger our collective will to vote of Donald Trump out of office will be.

Democrats are SURGING in red states and are NOW likely to WIN the Senate majority. I need your help.

Steve is in a critical Montana race that WILL determine the outcome of who holds power. SUPPORT STEVE → Everything will come down to Montana this fall – which is exactly why President Obama and Chuck Schumer are dumping MILLIONS of dollars into helping Steve’s liberal challenger win this race. And Alex, not only is the Senate majority at stake – but President Trump’s America First agenda will be CRUSHED if Steve loses his race. I need you to step up RIGHT NOW and throw your support behind Steve so we can make sure he WINS re-election and that the Republican Senate majority is PROTECTED. I’ve stood shoulder to shoulder with Steve in the Senate and watched firsthand how radical the Left has become. Make no mistake – if Schumer and Democrats win the majority – they will force their socialist agenda onto our country on DAY ONE.

Thank you, Steve Contribute » * * * \------ Begin forwarded message ------ Subject: Where the Senate majority will be decided From: Newt Gingrich Date: Tuesday, May 5, 2020 From the Desk of Newt Gingrich Alex, Right now Senate Democrats are launching a full-scale assault on Trump Republicans in the hopes they can flip the majority this November. Together we can stop them, but it's vital we support Chuck Schumer's top target, Senator Steve Daines, before 11:59 PM TONIGHT. You see, the Left knows they only need to win four Senate seats in order to reclaim the majority and they also know how Montana votes, will determine whether their plan succeeds or fails. That's why both President Obama and Chuck Schumer threw their support behind Steve's liberal opponent and why they're pouring MILLIONS into his campaign war chest. Senator Daines is facing an uphill battle and it's critical we step up and help him win RIGHT NOW! Contribute » Steve is a fearless fighter for President Trump and his America First agenda. During the impeachment SCAM it was Steve who stood up for the President and demanded his swift acquittal. Now, as our country faces a global pandemic – it is once again Steve who is fighting tirelessly for the American people while also demanding China's incompetence to control the virus be held accountable. Make no mistake, Democrats have a real shot at winning the Senate this fall and we MUST do everything in our power to ensure STRONG Republicans, like Steve, win re-election and protect the majority. I know Steve is fighting for you and your family EVERY DAY. Will you join me and fight for him before 11:59 PM TONIGHT?

Maybe it's because I stood up for Brett Kavanaugh – and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty – as Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee did their best to destroy a good man, while his family watched. Or maybe it's because I'm fed up with the Democrats' refusal to secure our southern border, which is causing a humanitarian and national security crisis. It could be any number of the common sense, conservative positions I've taken over the years, but of this I am certain: The Radical Left will say, do, or spend whatever it takes to defeat me. Now more than ever, I need to know if you're still standing by my side. Can I count on you to help me defend myself from the vicious and well-funded Democrat attack machine and rush a contribution of $10, $15, or even $20 to my campaign headquarters today? Rush over $10 Rush over $15 Rush over $20 Control of the U.S. Senate is at stake. In fact, control of our entire federal government is at stake. If you agree that the stakes are too high to be left to chance, I hope you'll make the most generous donation you can make today. Thank you so much for your consideration. Donate Now Sincerely, Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham P.S. If you need even more proof that I'm one of the top Republicans targeted for defeat, consider that Democratic Super PACs and others have already run over $700,000 in attack ads against me – 10 months before the election!

Staying aware, staying safe, and staying comfortable with your advocacy. Indivisibles, As many of you have likely seen and heard in the news, U.S. and global leaders are working on preparing their response to the coronavirus outbreak. We’re excited to report that a bipartisan funding bill to address the coronavirus outbreak has been signed into law to fund efforts to develop a vaccine and assist local and state governments’ responses. This bill also includes safeguards like transfer restrictions for the funding to keep Trump from stealing money for bad things (like his border wall, immigration enforcement, etc.). The bill also has language to help ensure that treatments and vaccines are affordable and accessible to everyone, not just the wealthy. We’ll keep you updated as we learn more as these measures get implemented, but we wanted to give a big “thank you” to all who called Congress to urge an appropriate response to this outbreak. You can read NPR’s coverage of the bill by clicking here. We also want to acknowledge concerns we’ve heard that folks are feeling apprehensive about hosting meetings and events in light of the virus. We encourage folks to respond in a way that feels appropriate and comfortable based on the information and resources you have about the status of coronavirus in your area. Here are some resources that may be helpful to you in planning: * How to prepare for coronavirus in the U.S. Read this article for practical tips on how to prepare. * Free advanced video conferencing for meetings of up to 250 participants through Google. If you feel more comfortable hosting meetings virtually, consider using this resource that Google announced it is rolling out for free to all users in response to the outbreak to meet virtually. Even though we’ve helped push legislation through Congress, there are some things you can be doing right now to alleviate those worries and help prevent catching or spreading #COVID19: 1. Avoid close contact with people who are already sick. 2. This one seems like common sense but still needs to be said - cover your coughs and sneezes. And afterward, you need to throw away your tissue and get a new one. 3. This one is hard to do once you're told to but it is so important! Don’t touch your face! Not your eyes, your nose, mouth, cheeks, any of it. 4. Stock up on disinfectant and use it. Clean any and all frequently touched surfaces and objects. 5. Stay home if you’re sick except to get medical care. Unfortunately in the world we live in this one is difficult for many people but if you’re able please stay home. 6. Wash your hands often WITH SOAP for at least 20 seconds. Just sing happy birthday to yourself twice - that’s the suggested length of time. Even if you think you’re fine and have a strong immune system it’s important that we all follow these steps to protect our neighbors and friends who are more vulnerable to the disease. We all have a responsibility to take care of each other and these are small first steps. And now, let’s get to those to-dos: * * * ###  Your weekly to-dos 1. Demand that Congress stop war with Iran. The House may vote this week on Sen. Kaine’s war powers resolution ([[URL REDACTED]]) that would prevent Trump from waging war with Iran unless Congress authorizes it. Call your MoC this week to tell them to vote Yes on the Kaine war powers resolution. 2. Demand that your Representative support the #NoBanAct. This week, the House will vote on the No Ban Act to repeal Trump’s Muslim Ban. The ban was one of the first executive actions Trump announced when he took office, and since then he has only made it broader and more severe. Use the resources at the #NoMuslimBanEver campaign website linked here to contact your Representative and tell them to #RepealTheBan! 3. Tell your Representative it's time to end surprise medical bills. Every day, over 10,000 families in the United States receive a surprise medical bill. Congress needs to act to protect patients, and in the process hold down health care costs for families and the health system overall. Call your Representative and tell them to end surprise medical bills for health services! 4. Text PAYBACK to 977-79 and join this fight right now. Even in the three weeks since we launched this project, we’ve already seen twists and turns and had to drop everything to respond to new Republican schemes. We know that’s not going to stop, which is why we need even more folks texting, donating, and joining local groups as we continue to get payback now until the election! * * * ###  2020 Update Last week was a bit of a rollercoaster, folks. Super Tuesday took some unexpected turns and the race winnowed even further. There are still 3,405 delegates -- 62% of all delegates -- up for grabs in this Democratic primary cycle, and there remain ample opportunities for the race to shift. Read on to get a recap of the last 7 days, and what to expect this week. * Super Tuesday shifted the balances. Last week’s contests on Super Tuesday dramatically changed the landscape of this primary cycle. In an unexpected shift, former VP Joe Biden gained a strong foothold from his surprising wins in Texas, Massachusetts, and Minnesota, all places where Sen. Bernie Sanders was projected to win. Biden netted 78 more Super Tuesday delegates than Sanders, putting Biden ahead in the total delegate count with 664 to Sanders’ 573. * Sen. Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the Democratic primary on March 5. Warren’s campaign was historic, inclusive, responsive, and grounded in heart AND policy. She earned the top spot on our 2020 candidate scorecard for her progressive platform and democracy plans. Though she’s out of the race, we know that she’ll continue to inspire the grassroots to persist. Self-funded billionaire candidate Mike Bloomberg also dropped out of the race on March 4, after three months on the campaign trail and over $500,000,000 spent on advertising alone. Bloomberg has endorsed Biden and pledged to put his personnel and financial resources behind the eventual nominee. * Six states will be voting tomorrow in the Democratic primary: Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, and Washington. A total of 352 delegates will be up for grabs. We’ll be keeping a close eye on delegate-rich Michigan, which holds over 1/3 of tomorrow’s delegates. The outcome in Michigan could, yet again, shift the trajectory of the primary. Want to improve your candidate’s chances in any of the “Big Tuesday” states? There’s still time for you to make an impact in this primary! Check out Indivisible’s “How to Impact the Primary” resource for more info on what you can do. Not sure who to support? Take a look at our scorecard and see how the candidates stack up. * * * ###  Our elections are in danger The New York Times reported recently that Russia is working to interfere in our elections -- again. So you’d think that one of the TWENTY election security bills that have been introduced in the Senate would have been passed, right? Nope. Mitch McConnell and his GOP cronies have blocked every one of them from even being considered. They’re so hell-bent on keeping Trump in office that they’re willing to ignore the facts and do whatever it takes to hold onto power, up to and including giving up our democracy itself. Protecting our democracy starts with taking back the Senate. That’s why we started the Payback Project -- to kick 10 of the worst anti-democratic, Trump-enabling senators out of office this year. We can’t do it without you: pitch in $10 to take back the Senate, support the Payback Project, and fund all our work. * * * ###  IndivisiWin of the Week Indivisibles in New York come together with a partner group, Next Generation Politics, to share and train the next generation of grassroots leaders. That’s all we have for you today. Stay aware, stay vigilant, and above all, it’s important to be safe. We’re committed to keeping you informed as we know more about the outbreak and how it may impact our work going forward.

"It" is the primary elections Image Hi Alex, There seems to be a feeling of anticipation this week. Here in Denver, at least, it feels like we’re turning the corner, and we’re all eager to get life back to normal. (It’s not almost over, and life probably won’t go back to normal -- for the record.) But as we look ahead with anticipation, it’s important we look back and reflect. With that in mind here are three things to think about this week. Image Here’s how we can do primaries better On the subject of reflection, our friends at FairVote, Rob Richie and Dave Daley, co-authored a piece this week about how we can do our primary elections better. After a primary election season marked by coronavirus, the chaos of Iowa (remember that!), and a media frenzy that saw dozens of candidates drop out before a single vote had been cast, it’s time to do our presidential primaries better so that they represent more voters. From establishing ranked choice voting to fixing the schedule of the primaries, there are simple, common sense changes to our primary system that would make them drastically more representative. “There’s an immediate challenge in front of us: A November election that could take on a radically different form than most Americans are accustomed to,” they write, “As we protect this fall’s vote, let’s also not lose sight of the important and easy fixes we can make to preserve and improve democracy for many more cycles to come.” Twitter Facebook Image A look back on what happened in Utah When thinking about reform-minded states, I’d bet Utah isn’t the first state that comes to mind. Indeed, Utah, led by both a Republican legislature and governor, has been a national leader when it comes to adopting reform-minded policies, as one of only five states that uses universal vote by mail for their elections. An article from a local news station in Utah this week shows how this voters-first type of thinking extends even into their political parties. As state parties grapple with how to hold state assemblies virtually, both the Utah Republican party as well as the Utah Democrats have been out in front, adopting election reforms to keep voters safe and elections secure. Both parties are using mobile voting apps to tabulate votes from their conventions, and both are using ranked choice voting when tabulating those votes. They’re keeping their delegates safe while keeping democracy trudging. It’s an impressive bipartisan prioritization from the parties, who are generally wary of change. As the chairman of the Utah Republican party said, “As a political party... we’re adapting, and the irony is that political parties generally haven’t been very quick to adapt.” Twitter Facebook Image Finally, look ahead (at some new opportunities) November is coming up fast, and between now and then, there’s a lot we at Unite America are trying to accomplish. But it’s not just us. Across the movement, there are dozens of groups that are still trucking along, in spite of it all. Check out [[URL REDACTED]] and share it with people in your network. So many Americans are looking for a new job opportunity now, and we may just be looking for them too. Even if you’re not looking for a job, someone you know might be.

That subject lines get more clever if you read the email Alex, Hello and welcome back to your regularly scheduled Three Things emails. We got right back into the swing of things last week, announcing the winners of the Accelerator Awards grants with RepresentUs. Miss the announcement? Check out the winners here. Let’s get to it, shall we? Nothing but good things this week. Here are three things to read, watch and share: ## 1\. Here are 9 ways to fix America (and we’re one of them!) Through the daily smog of partisanship, misinformation, and animosity in our country, it can be difficult to see the points of light. This week, CNN’s senior political analyst John Avlon attempts to show us the light with 9 ways to stitch our country back together. From teaching civics in school to simplifying the tax code to instituting common sense reforms that make our elections more representative (we love to see it), Avlon’s recommendations are all-encompassing and straightforward. “A more representative and less polarized election process will result in a more representative and less-polarized Congress. And it will change the political bench for statewide and national office, incentivizing bipartisan legislation at every level of government,” he writes. “If we can change the rules, we can change the game.” ## 2\. Gordon Gecko wants you to know: our system’s broken. Our friends at RepresentUs released the latest video in their “Unbreaking America” series this week -- and boy, is it good. Michael Douglas in Unbreaking America We’re stuck in a partisan doom-loop, with both sides playing a game of political chicken to see who’s going to blink first. The loser: We, the people. Watch their video, then watch the first video in their Unbreaking America series with Jennifer Lawrence. ## 3\. Through partisanship, political courage shines through. Finally, some state news: the Virginia legislature this year will debate instituting independent redistricting commissions to draw legislative maps following the 2020 census. It passed once last year with a divided senate and house. Now, Democrats control all chambers, and the governor's office. Legislators must now ask themselves: will they capitulate to keep themselves in power, or will they stand up and put voters first? In a promising development, the new majority leader in the House, Delegate Charnielle Herring, said she’s planning on supporting independent redistricting commissions, putting the people she serves over party power. That’s BIG. As an editorial by the Daily Progress said, “It’s high time to restore voters’ ultimate control over elections. It’s time to end the partisan manipulation through which politicians engineer the voting outcomes they desire.” Best, Brett __ Brett Maney Senior Communications Manager Unite America DONATE To make sure you keep getting these emails, please add [[URL REDACTED]] to your address book or whitelist us.

Like her spare time spent sewing, knitting and crocheting, Sharon Ponton’s win in VPAP’s Pundit Contest was “very old school.” Sharon, 64, has lived in Lovingston, the seat of rural Nelson County, for 30 years. During that time, local politics have been a common thread. These days, she works for the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League. “A while back” she was the chair of the Nelson County Democratic Committee, Sharon said. But even before that, she grew up in Loudoun County, just outside of the 5th Congressional District where she now lives. Sharon’s knowledge of Nelson County and the “really difficult” congressional district it’s a part of helped her thread the needle. She bested 395 hopefuls who entered VPAP’s June Primary Pundit contest. Perhaps the news of her win should have come as less of a surprise to her. “I don’t know how I did that, but okay!,” Sharon said, nearly in stitches when she heard. “Right now, I couldn’t even tell you who I picked, honestly.” A self-described “political junkie” who’s followed VPAP a long time, Sharon was one of 44 who correctly guessed the winners of the primaries in VPAP’s semi-annual quiz. One of those correct predictions was in the 5th Congressional District, where Sharon lives. She correctly guessed Dr. Cameron Webb would beat three opponents. “That was really a personal preference,” Sharon said. “I thought it would be a much closer race than it was. I was really surprised that he won by the margin that he won by, but I think it’s really good, too.” In the first-tiebreaker, Sharon’s home-field advantage also gave her an edge. Contestants were asked to predict whether there would be more Republican or Democratic primary votes in the Rockfish precinct in Nelson County, where Rep. Denver Riggleman resides. For Sharon, it was as easy as knit 1, purl 2. “I don’t vote in that precinct, but I know the county pretty well,” Sharon said. “So it made sense to me that in Rockfish they would choose more Democratic ballots than Republican ballots. It’s changed some, but generally, we have a decent chance of Democrats winning here.” Sharon’s local knowledge propelled her (along with 16 other contestants) to the second tiebreaker: Predict statewide percentage of Republican votes cast by mail. “I felt like, with the pandemic, that the absentee votes would be up a little bit,” she said. “We even considered voting absentee, my husband and I,” Sharon said. “It was a consideration for us, so I thought a lot of other people might do that too.” She guessed 10.9% — pretty darn close to the actual figure of 10.02%. Recent winners have relied upon data and statistical analysis. Sharon — who likes things that are “very old school for this old woman” — stitched together a winning entry using local knowledge and common sense.

But the old result, failure of criminal law reforms in a subcommittee long called “the killing fields,” is changing now that Democrats have won control of the General Assembly. The words addressed to a legislator proposing a new law — “What is the problem and how does your bill fix it?” — echo a traditional formula set for two decades by GOP chairs of the House of Delegates’ criminal law subcommittee, a key General Assembly gatekeeper. ### 'FACING A DIRE NEED' FOR FUNDING FOR SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION, VIRGINIA LAWMAKERS PITCH PROPOSALS By AMY FRIEDENBERGER, Roanoke Times (Metered Paywall - 10 articles a month) In some public schools across Virginia, rainwater leaks into classrooms, teachers turn on dehumidifiers so posters don’t peel off the walls, ceiling tiles are falling, mold grows in the walls and rats scurry around floors.

By DAVE RESS, Daily Press (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month) A clash over the public’s right to see how Virginia courts are run is sparking a challenge to one of the basics of American politics: the checks and balances of the three branches of government.

Tony Wilt, R-Broadway, looked to create the Beehive Distribution Program in 2018, he didn’t know how much of a buzz it would be — or that it would run out of beehives to give away in less than a year.

Two families — the Gesick family from Virginia Beach and the Van Cleave family from Yorktown — want to change that, so they’re advocating for Seizure Safe Schools legislation in Virginia. ### LEGISLATION MAKING MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TO VIRGINIA STUDENTS MOVES ON TO FULL SENATE By MICHAEL POPE, WVTF Evie Garces-Foley is a high school student in Falls Church, and she travelled to Richmond to explain to lawmakers the importance of having menstrual products available to students. “I got my period in the middle of a standardized test in ninth grade, and there wasn’t anything I could do because there weren't any products in the bathroom for me to be able to use," she said.

Online responses to a recent Winchester Star article about the proposition ranged from "Hell No!!!" to "I'll think about it" to "Of all the hare-brained ideas this takes the cake." But it also got people on this side of the border thinking.

The area around the Capitol is fenced off and surrounding streets will be closed to traffic. ### LOCAL AUTONOMY IMPORTANT TO STATUES ISSUE Daily Progress Editorial (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month) “That government is best which governs least,” Henry David Thoreau affirmed. It’s a quote often wrongly attributed to Thomas Jefferson. But regardless of its pedigree, it’s often cited by conservatives to support the concept of limited government. From that perspective, then, state government should not be telling local governments what they can do with their public parks. ### ANOTHER STEP FORWARD FOR RURAL BROADBAND News & Advance Editorial (Metered Paywall - 10 articles a month) Earlier this month, residents of eight Central and Southside Virginia counties got a belated Christmas present from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

To build one, however, it’s essential that the cities here work constructively and cooperatively in order to share both the cost of construction and the resulting revenue. ### FREDERICK COULD VOTE TO JOIN WEST VIRGINIA ANYTIME Winchester Star Editorial (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month) Imagine a 158-year-old invitation laying dormant until discovered by a state senator researching the 100th anniversary of the creation of his state.

MORSE, Published in the Virginian-Pilot (Metered Paywall - 3 articles a month) Guns save lives and vaccines don’t. So, say some of our fellow Americans and they mean to prevail on those points.

KEANE, Published in the Richmond Times-Dispatch (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month) Recently elected Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, has introduced legislation that not only defies the concepts of common sense and gun safety, but also would crush small businesses in Virginia. HB 567 would make private, indoor gun ranges illegal in the commonwealth. Helmer’s reasoning, according to a statement posted on Twitter, is “... it’s dangerous to have gun ranges in offices with many employees in light of recent workplace shootings.” Lawrence G. Keane is the senior vice president of government relations and public affairs and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry’s trade association. ### KLEM AND SCHOOMAKER: UNRESTRICTED ACCESS TO GUNS MAKES OUR FAMILIES, COMMUNITIES LESS SAFE By SARAH KLEM AND HEIDI SCHOOMAKER, Published in the Richmond Times-Dispatch (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month) As a kid in Short Pump, one of us found a rifle in her parents’ closet. Sarah thought it was a toy, so she played with it. It wasn’t until years later that she realized that toy was, in fact, a very real rifle.

SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS RULING THAT GMU FOUNDATION NOT SUBJECT TO FOIA REQUEST By FRANK GREEN, Richmond Times-Dispatch (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month) A unanimous Virginia Supreme Court on Thursday upheld last year’s ruling by a Fairfax County judge that the George Mason University Foundation need not disclose details of gifts to the school under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act. #### VIRGINIA OTHER ### JUDGE APPROVES $2.15 MILLION SETTLEMENT OF LAWSUIT AGAINST MOUNTAIN VALLEY PIPELINE By LAURENCE HAMMACK, Roanoke Times (Metered Paywall - 10 articles a month) Mountain Valley Pipeline will pay $2.15 million for the environmental damage it has caused so far in building a natural gas pipeline through Southwest Virginia, while facing additional penalties for any new violations that may occur. Those were the conditions of a settlement, approved this week, of a lawsuit brought against the company by state regulators. #### LOCAL ### AN ACHIEVABLE DREAM ACADEMY TO EXPAND IN VIRGINIA BEACH DESPITE BACKLOG OF SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS By ALISSA SKELTON, Virginian-Pilot (Metered Paywall - 3 articles a month) An Achievable Dream Academy will expand in Virginia Beach — despite questions from some city council members if constructing a new home for the school was really the best use of taxpayer money. ### MICHAEL VICK OWES HAMPTON $70,000 IN BACK TAXES ON LUXURY CARS By DAVE RESS, Daily Press (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month) Former football star Michael Vick left his Hampton mansion years ago, but he still owes the city $70,800 in unpaid taxes on a fleet of luxury cars. Vick lived in the city after serving time in prison on federal charges of running a dog-fighting operation in Surry County, in which, federal investigators reported, he was involved in strangling and drowning some dogs. ### SPOTSYLVANIA SUPERVISORS VOTE TO BAN EMPLOYEES FROM SERVING ON BOARD By SCOTT SHENK, Free Lance-Star (Metered Paywall - 10 articles a month) The Spotsylvania County Board of Supervisors approved a resolution to ban county government employees from serving on the board. Following a brief discussion at Tuesday’s meeting, supervisors voted to approve the measure, 5–1. Chris Yakabouski voted against the change while Kevin Marshall, a county employee, abstained. ### OWNER OF ALLEGED ILLEGAL LANDFILL NO SHOW IN COURT By TERRY BEIGIE, Greene County Record A lawyer with the state attorney general’s office was in Greene County Circuit Court on Dec. 2 asking the judge to assist the state in getting proper information, documentation and answers in a case against a Ruckersville man the state claims has been operating an illegal landfill on his property. The Department of Environmental Quality, Virginia Waste Management Board and the State Water Quality Board jointly filed the lawsuit on Aug. 9 against Kenneth Collier Sr., who lost his bid for Greene County sheriff in November. Collier was not present for the scheduled motion’s hearing ### FREDERICK COUNTY MAKES 50-FOOT TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS A BY-RIGHT USE By JOSH JANNEY, Winchester Star (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month) The Frederick County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously on Wednesday night to amend county code to make small telecommunications towers a by-right use. Previously, all commercial telecommunication towers required a conditional-use permit (CUP). ### SMITHFIELD TO BUY TIMES BUILDING By DIANA MCFARLAND, Smithfield Times (Paywall) The Town of Smithfield has entered into a contract to purchase The Smithfield Times building and grounds, located in the center of Main Street in the historic district. A contract was signed Friday and the news was announced during the annual Christmas tree lighting, held, fittingly, at what is known locally as “Times Square.” The deal is expected to close March 1, said former Smithfield Times Editor and Publisher John Edwards ### HUNDREDS ATTEND HAMPTON COUNCIL MEETING TO WEIGH IN ON SECOND AMENDMENT SANCTUARY ISSUE By LISA VERNON SPARKS, Daily Press (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month) It wasn’t on the Hampton City Council agenda, but the debate surrounding Second Amendment sanctuaries dominated the Wednesday meeting, drawing hundreds of residents and gun owners. ### AS 2ND AMENDMENT SANCTUARY MOVEMENT ARRIVES IN REGION, IT IS UNCLEAR IF IT WILL ACCOMPLISH ITS GOALS By JACK JACOBS AND EMILY HOLTER, Daily Press (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month) As a movement to create 2nd Amendment sanctuaries gains momentum across Virginia, the supremacy of state law over local law poses a potential roadblock. But what ultimately happens might depend on what laws actually pass, how far the state will go to enforce them and how far localities will go to oppose those efforts. ### SURRY SHIES AWAY FROM SANCTUARY DESIGNATION By FREDERIC LEE, Smithfield Times (Paywall) The Surry County Board of Supervisors passed a resolution upholding the Second Amendment Thursday, but stopped short of declaring the county a “Second Amendment Sanctuary,” resulting in a backlash from the public. ### FAUQUIER SUPERVISORS PUT OFF GUN RIGHTS VOTE UNTIL DEC.23 By JAMES IVANCIC, Fauquier Times At a Fauquier County supervisors meeting Dec. 12, speaker after speaker urged their elected officials to pass a resolution with tough language against any attempt by a Democratic Party-controlled Virginia General Assembly to infringe on gun owner rights. At the end of a 4 ½ hour-long public comment period that drew 71 speakers (69 in favor of a strongly worded resolution and two against), Board Chairman Chris Butler, R-Lee, said he wanted more time to consider what was said and to consult with legal staff. ### FREDERICK COUNTY ADOPTS SECOND AMENDMENT RESOLUTION By JOSH JANNEY, Winchester Star (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month) With about a thousand people crowded into and around the County Administration Building, the Frederick County Board of Supervisors on Wednesday night unanimously adopted a resolution opposing any laws that would infringe on the Second Amendment rights of its citizens to keep and bear arms. ### NORTHAMPTON SIDESTEPS SECOND AMENDMENT SANCTUARY By STEFANIE JACKSON, Eastern Shore Post Northampton supervisors unanimously passed a resolution Tuesday night that supports gun rights but does not establish the county as a Second Amendment sanctuary. The resolution “urges the Governor and members of the General Assembly to take no action which would violate the freedoms guaranteed” by the U.S. Constitution and Virginia constitution. Today's Sponsor: ####  Commonwealth Prayer Breakfast The 54th Annual Commonwealth Prayer Breakfast is January 8th, the day the General Assembly convenes and the Governor delivers the State of the Commonwealth. [[URL REDACTED]] #### EDITORIALS ### THERE'S NO GOOD WAY TO PAY FOR ROADS Roanoke Times Editorial (Metered Paywall - 10 articles a month) News item: Virginia Transportation Secretary Shannon Valentine says Gov. Ralph Northam may ask the General Assembly to raise gas taxes to pay for new roads. Whoa, wait. Where did this come from? We just had an election. Did anyone run on a platform of raising gas taxes? We thought the election was all about how people felt about President Trump and new gun laws. Now you tell us you want to raise gas taxes. Why does this feel like a bait-and-switch? ### A MORE TRANSPARENT LEGISLATURE Virginian-Pilot Editorial (Metered Paywall - 3 articles a month) When the Virginia General Assembly convenes in January, lawmakers will hit the ground running. The so-called “long” session lasts 60 days, compared to 45 in the “short” sessions in odd-numbered years, in which the legislature will consider more than 3,500 bills. That’s a massive workload for lawmakers and their staffs. It’s a challenge for the ever-dwindling number of media members who cover the General Assembly. And for the general public? Forget about tracking every detail of the legislature’s work while balancing the demands of work and home life. ### IN THE PUSH FOR HIGH-TECH JOBS, VIRGINIA CAN BRIDGE REGIONAL DIVIDES Richmond Times-Dispatch Editorial (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month) High-tech jobs are an important economic indicator for U.S. cities of all sizes. As a May 2018 Bureau of Labor Statistics brief explained, these positions matter because “they produce a large share of total output, and from a workforce standpoint, they employ a large numbers of skilled workers and provide higher wages for all types of workers.” #### OP-ED ### DUBOIS: NORTHAM PROPOSAL TRUE TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROOTS By GLENN DUBOIS, Published in the Richmond Times-Dispatch (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month) Gov. Ralph Northam’s recently announced proposal to create more affordable pathways to community college programs leading to high-demand jobs for low- and middle-income Virginians is true to the original promise of Virginia’s Community Colleges. Glenn DuBois is the chancellor of Virginia’s Community Colleges #### THE FRIDAY READ ### U.S. TROOPS COULD SOON BE ABLE TO SUE OVER MEDICAL BLUNDERS By DAVE PHILIPPS, New York Times (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month) VIRGINIA BEACH -- Lt. Rudolph Feres parachuted into the darkness in the first hours of D-Day in 1944. He fought his way through the hedgerows of Normandy and the snows of the Bulge to the final defeat of Nazi Germany, and was highly decorated for valor. Generations of servicemen and women since then have heard his name, but not for any of that. Instead, it has been invoked time and again to deny active-duty members of the military a right extended to nearly every other American — to sue for injuries. * * * Subscribe Donate Content Policy Privacy This email was sent to [[EMAIL_REDACTED]] why did I get this? unsubscribe from this list update subscription preferences Virginia Public Access Project · P.O.

[[URL REDACTED]] A weekly collection of Virginia political commentary from a variety of viewpoints July 19, 2020 #### Masks ###  Smolens: The shifting politics of face masks: Whose freedom is it? By MICHAEL SMOLENS, published in San Diego Union-Tribune Congressional Republicans put out a clear message last week: Face masks are OK. You should wear one. The concerted effort, reluctantly joined by President Donald Trump, should ease the partisan tension, if not end it, over face masks in the battle to stem the spread of the deadly coronavirus. Hopefully, that will do the same for the larger philosophical struggle that frames the dispute, one that has been at the center of American culture and history since the nation’s founding — individual choice and liberty vs. collective freedom and security. Smolens is a columnist for the San Diego Union-Tribune. * * * ###  Wagoner: ‘No mask, no entry. Is that clear enough?' By LORI WAGONER, published in Washington Post (Metered Paywall - 3 articles a month) We tried our best to be polite about it. I’d frame it to customers like they were doing us this big favor: “Would you please consider wearing a mask?” “May we offer you a free mask?” “We sure do appreciate your cooperation.” I’ll never understand what’s so hard about putting on a mask for a few minutes. It’s common sense. It’s a requirement now in North Carolina. But this is a conservative place, and there are only 900 people in this town. We try hard to get along. We’re a small general store, and we didn’t want to end up in one of those viral videos with people spitting or screaming about their civil rights. We put a sign outside — an appeal to kindness. “If you wear a mask, it shows how much you care about us.” We found out how much they cared. It became clear real quick. Wagoner is a retail clerk in a general store in North Carolina. * * * ###  LaRock: Please help us liberate Virginia! By DAVE LAROCK, published in Bull Elephant The Governor is threatening to continue current or even more mandates and restrictions, including facemasks and even forcing an unsafe vaccine, indefinitely, perhaps as long as he remains in office. These lawsuits are our best option to reign in his overreach into every area of our lives and businesses. LaRock, a Republican, represents District 33 in the Virginia House of Delegates. * * * #### Back to School? ###  Martinson: Please Don’t Make Me Risk Getting Covid-19 to Teach Your Child By REBECCA MARTINSON, published in New York Times (Metered Paywall - 1 to 2 articles a month) Every day when I walk into work as a public-school teacher, I am prepared to take a bullet to save a child. In the age of school shootings, that’s what the job requires. But asking me to return to the classroom amid a pandemic and expose myself and my family to Covid-19 is like asking me to take that bullet home to my own family. I won’t do it, and you shouldn’t want me to. Martinson is a public-school teacher in Washington State. * * * ###  Dougherty: Teachers Are Afraid To Return To Their Classrooms By KERRY DOUGHERTY, published in Kerry: Unemployed & Unedited We all knew this was [[URL REDACTED]] private schools plan to reopen fully this fall with students in class five days a week. Sadly, it looks like most public school kids will not be so lucky. All across the country militant teachers’ unions are balking at a return to the classroom. In Fairfax County, teachers groups are saying they don’t want to return to school until there’s a Covid-19 vaccine. Dougherty, a retired columnist for The Virginian-Pilot, writes the blog Unemployed and Unedited * * * ###  Bacon: The Opportunity Agenda: K-12 Vouchers By JAMES A. BACON, published in Bacon's Rebellion The fastest, quickest, most sure-fire way to eliminate “structural racism” in Virginia’s public education system is to empower parents financially to find alternatives to failing public [[URL REDACTED]] vouchers would not hurt public school systems. For every $4,500 a school district loses in state aid, it is relieved of the fiscal burden of educating one less student. Bacon publishes the Bacon's Rebellion blog. * * * #### Protests ###  Fischer: Sticks + Stones By CHANCE FISCHER, published in Cheats Movement “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me.” I’d like to accept that statement as fact, that words are powerless when ignored. The truth is words have harmed black people more than any bullet or fist ever could. Laws find power in words and words mean things. Words define a life we perpetually misinterpret and misunderstand. Words provide justification for police firing their weapons at me when I am unarmed, helpless, hopeless. Fischer is a rapper, writer, and thought provoker from Richmond. * * * ###  Mervine: Open Letter To JMU President By STEPHEN JAY MERVINE, published in Daily News Record (Metered Paywall - 5 articles a month) Dear President Jonathan Alger, As I write to you today, I can barely express the disappointment I feel about your decision to rename the buildings on campus. I had to take a few days to calm down after reading your email regarding the change. Make no mistake, I’m no Confederate, flag-waving sympathizer. But I am a 1984 James Madison University graduate who studied history and political science under the renowned Henry Myers. I am completely disgusted today by your blatant maneuver toward revisionist history. History is something that we can only study, not change. SMervine, JMU Class of 1984, lives in Bridgeville, Del. * * * ###  Stern: Black Judge Has to Explain to White Colleague Why Racial Profiling Is Bad By MARK JOSEPH STERN, published in Slate The federal judiciary is experiencing a crisis of diversity. President Donald Trump has appointed mostly white men to the courts, undoing the progress his Democratic predecessors made toward building a bench that looks more like the country it serves. Diverse judges bring different perspectives to their work—a deeper understanding of racial discrimination, for instance, or a better sense of how law enforcement can oppress minority communities. These benefits were on full display when, on Thursday, a Black judge had to teach his colleague about the existence of racial profiling by police. Stern covers courts and the law for Slate. # Invite Friends to read VaNews Invite two friends to read VaNews and you'll receive VaViews, a weekly compilation of commentary from a variety of viewpoints.

Dear Alex, First of all, I wanted to say Happy Mother's Day! We're nothing without our mothers -- literally! HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY TO ALL OF OUR LOVING MOMS! Since representing Maine in Congress, I’ve enjoyed staying in the fight for common sense solutions to the serious problems impacting our families and small businesses. Like holding Governor Janet Mills accountable for extending her lockdown, killing our jobs, and having no reasonable plan to safely reopen the economy right before our critical tourism season begins. And, exposing Governor Mills and her far left Democrat Majority for recklessly spending and borrowing an additional $1 billion over the past year, leaving no financial cushion going into the COVID-19 recession. Like returning to one-person, one-vote sanity and ending the ranked choice voting scam for our presidential election in November. And, calling out open border liberals for refusing to help President Trump secure our borders to keep deadly drugs and infectious diseases out of our country. And, explaining how our Republican building blocks of lower taxes, fewer regulations, cheap energy and fairer trade deals resulted in the strongest economy in fifty years until the coronavirus pandemic hit. Last week, I launched my new website to stay better connected with you. Please click here to sign-up to receive regular updates. You can also listen to my radio interviews, read the OpEds, and easily connect with me on Facebook and Twitter. Plus, you can weigh-in on my next survey question below (and also see the results of last week’s poll): "Do you agree with President Donald Trump’s Executive Order temporarily halting most legal immigration to give priority to Americans looking for jobs as our economy reopens?" I’m grateful to the Maine GOP for allowing me to invite you to sign-up on my new website for regular updates about how we conservatives can battle to shape the decisions coming out of Augusta and Washington. Every month, I push our common sense positions on seven different talk radio shows across Maine. Several times each week, I spread the good word on Facebook and Twitter. My OpEds are published in the major daily newspapers throughout Maine. The bigger we get, the stronger our voice! I look forward to staying connected with you.

Alex, We hope you are doing well and staying safe as our state weathers the storm this virus has created. We’re writing today because even though much of the state has slowed down or stopped during this pandemic, our candidates for the Maine Legislature still need to prepare for the upcoming election. With many events and in-person activities shut down, many of our candidates who are using the Maine Clean Election Program are facing a deadline of collecting $5 donations. The donations our Republican candidates receive by MIDNIGHT TONIGHT (May 18) will determine how much funding they receive to make Maine red again! Helping push your local Republican candidate to victory is easy. All that it requires is to submit a $5 donation to their campaign through MCEA's secure donation page which can be found HERE. Your $5 contribution to help your Republican Legislative candidate qualify for the MCEA program will be a key contribution to the work of reclaiming seats in the Maine Legislature and bringing some common sense back to our legislature. If you have any questions about how to do the online contribution for MCEA candidates, the Maine Senate Republicans have put together an easy-to-understand video tutorial you can watch by clicking here. From that page you can click to contribute as well. The system is safe, secure, and again, critical for the candidate’s success in November of 2020. Thank you for all that you do.

Waging a legal fight to compete in 2020 Summer 2020 Newsletter What's Inside: * Chairman's update * 2020 Republican Congressional candidates * Beacon Hill campaign rundown: Q&A with MassGOP Political Director John Milligan * Eleven MassGOP state legislative candidates to watch this fall * Commentary on police reform, by Republican State Committeeman Dennis Galvin * Chairman's Circle speaker series recap * MassGOP leadership update * Evaluating Joe Biden, by Republican State Committeeman Dr. Jay Fleitman * MassGOP Veterans Coalition launch: A Q&A with founder John MacDonald * Highlights of Republican activity across the Commonwealth Waging a legal fight for the right to compete in 2020 Dear Friends, The COVID-19 pandemic has made life difficult for all, and the Massachusetts Republican Party has been no exception. Over the past several months, MassGOP staff worked tirelessly to ensure positions for Republicans on the 2020 ballot, but some of the roadblocks that sprung up came not from the virus, but from the Democrats’ apparent insistence on using the emergency conditions as a means of minimizing Republican threats to their power. Consider the situation that confronted Helen Brady. Brady, a strong Republican who played by the signature-collecting rules implemented by the Supreme Judicial Court after Beacon Hill Democrats stubbornly refused to address the issue, is challenging entrenched incumbent and career politician, U.S. Rep. Bill Keating. The vice chairman of the Massachusetts Democratic Party lodged a complaint with the Massachusetts Secretary of State, triggering a state Ballot Law Commission review. Incredibly, the SBLC upheld the complaint. Once again, just like the effort to amend the signature-collecting process to align with pandemic-related safeguards, we were forced to go to court. Once again, we won. I reflected on Helen’s ordeal in an opinion piece that ran in the Boston Herald last month. Here's the short version: Simply gaining access to the ballot "required the intervention of the Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to stop the Democrat power brokers from thwarting democracy in the 9th Congressional District." Fighting these legal battles just to ensure voters have a choice in November has not been cheap. It is with this in mind that a new MassGOP legal fund was created. According to reports, Joe Biden's presidential campaign has hired more than 600 lawyers, and you can bet that the radical Democrats here in Massachusetts will try to litigate away any November outcome here in Massachusetts that they don't like. Meanwhile, there's much work to be done ahead of the election. As you'll read in this newsletter, we have a slate of reliable conservatives running for Congress, and we have identified winnable state House and Senate districts, all being contested by Republicans. The 2020 crop of Republicans candidates will give Massachusetts voters a choice -- either Beacon Hill continues to hurl itself down a chute to socialism, or the values of freedom, independence and liberty for all, and American exceptionalism prevail. What does it say to the future of our commonwealth when immediately following a night of violence, rioting, and looting in downtown Boston, our own Democrat attorney general cheerfully explains it away by exclaiming in remarks, "yes, America is burning -- but that's how forests grow." Earlier this summer, the Democrat-dominated Massachusetts state Senate rammed through during the predawn hour a reform bill intended to harm police, without a single public hearing. Our own Republican State Committeeman Dennis Galvin, a retired Massachusetts State Police major, has shared his thoughts in this newsletter on the equally disastrous House version of this bill, passed late last month. Meanwhile, the Democrats are also busy eyeing tax increases as a means of correcting the impending state budget shortfall. Increasing the ranks of Republicans in the state Legislature is needed now, more than ever. The successful reelection of President Donald J. Trump remains a top priority. Despite the cancellation of the 2020 Republican National Convention in Jacksonville, enthusiasm for President Trump among Republicans remains high. The majority of Americans are rightfully concerned about the Democrats' platform of defunding police and encouraging mob rule to dominate the streets of American cities. The Democrats' current vision involves not only condemning the past, but hijacking the future. Republicans know this, and the MassGOP stands committed to providing voters with a pro-America alternative. Candidates matter, and the party is defining itself with a blue-collar mentality. Just like in 2016, current polls do not tell the whole story. Ours is the party of jobs, energy independence, strong borders, and the rule of law. Theirs is the party that prefers to police speech instead of crime, thumbs its collective nose at patriotism, and actively encourages mob rule. When presented with a choice, and Americans will indeed be presented with one in November, they will be choosing between two drastically different futures: one that celebrates and honors America's founding principles, and another undoubtedly ushering in an era of Big Government socialism. I am confident that Americans will choose the former.

This is her second bid to unseat entrenched incumbent Democrat U.S. Rep. Jim McGovern. In 2018, as a political outsider, Tracy earned 33% of the vote while being outspent 37-1. Tracy is an unwavering defender of the Constitution and also supports Congressional term limits. Learn more about Tracy by visiting her website here, following her on Twitter here, or checking in with her on Facebook here. 4th District﻿ Julie Hall, who served in the U.S. Air Force for more than three decades, achieving the rank of colonel, has a message for voters: “Just as I served our country for more than 30 years, I am prepared to serve the 4th Congressional District as your next United States Representative.” The former Attleboro city councilor is a staunch believer in America’s founding principles, and counts border security as one of her top priorities. Visit Julie’s website here, follow her on Facebook here, or connect with her on Twitter here. 5th District Stoneham Selectwoman Caroline Colarusso is someone with a genuine love for community involvement, so stepping up to offer a Republican choice for Congress should come as no surprise. Colarusso “has always given back to the community,” whether it’s serving on the Stoneham Board of Selectmen or coaching youth hockey. The mother of three has already received an endorsement from the National Federation of Independent Businesses. Visit Caroline’s website here, follow her on Twitter here, or interact with her on Facebook here. 6th District When John Paul Moran founded Grand Opportunity USA, he did so knowing there are more young adults who believe in the power of the individual and personal responsibility than media coverage would lead us to believe. The Billerica-based entrepreneur, author, and activist is a self-described “unconventional candidate” and “opportunity Republican.” John Paul vows to “oppose dictator economics –socialism – and foster a pro-business environment to provide economic opportunity for all.” Visit John Paul’s website here, follow him on Twitter here, or interact with him on Facebook here. 7th District She may be forced into running a write-in campaign, but underestimate Randolph resident Rayla Campbell at your own peril, because the Democrats have already been forced to take notice of her ability to fight and can-do attitude. Campbell fell just short of reaching the ballot signature threshold, as the COVID-19 pandemic has hit the commonwealth’s sole minority-majority district particularly hard. Yet that hasn’t stopped this mother of three from campaigning up a storm in the Boston area. Visit Rayla’s website here, connect with her on Facebook here, or follow her on Twitter here. 9th District Weeks into her campaign to oust an entrenched South Coast Democrat, Helen Brady is already battle-tested. Helen had to appeal to the commonwealth’s highest court just to earn her place on the ballot, after Democrats tried to have her disqualified amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Helen prevailed, and showed she’s only just begun to fight. Helen, a mother of four, is a no-nonsense Republican who is “fed up with the radical left agenda” and is more than ready to “give ‘em Helen.” She’s also the business director at the Boston Symphony Orchestra for the Boston Pops. Visit Helen’s website here, follow her on Twitter here, or interact with her on Facebook here. 2020 Senate Congressional Candidates Kevin O'Connor Dover-based attorney Kevin O'Connor, a father of four and the son of a journalist and public school teacher, is campaigning on the platform that includes a vow to "always insist on the fair and impartial application of our Constitute and laws for all, regardless of station in life." O'Connor, who helped lead the legal fight to adjust ballot signature requirements amid the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, believes that a Congressional delegation that includes a Republican like himself can better advocate across the aisle for local issues.

The Massachusetts Republican Senate Primary is scheduled for Sept. 1 Beacon Hill campaign rundown After a spring spent scrambling to qualify as many Republican candidates as possible for the 2020 ballot, MassGOP Political Director John Milligan said he's feeling confident heading into primary season. Q: Merely getting Republicans to qualify for the 2020 ballot was a challenge. Can you tell us what some of the biggest hurdles were, and how we managed to work with the Secretary of State's office to establish a workable way to safely secure ballot signatures? JM: Obviously collecting signatures in the middle of a pandemic is not easy. The first thing we did was work with the secretary of state's office to allow us to resize the signature sheets so people could print them in their own homes. Republican State Committeeman John Miller helped us with this effort, producing PDFs for candidates up and down the ballot. The next major win came with the Supreme Judicial Court ruling allowing electronic collection of signatures. We were then able to use peer-to-peer texting, power dialer software, and emails to help our candidates make the 2020 ballot. Q: How many Republicans are challenging Democrats in 2020? JM: We currently have 30 Republicans challenging incumbent Democrats in the state Legislature, including three competitive GOP Primaries. At the Federal level, we have a U.S. Senate primary and GOP challengers in six out of our nine congressional districts. Q: What do you see as our greatest strength in 2020? Our greatest weakness? JM: Our greatest strength is that polling consistently shows conservative voters want to come out and vote on election day despite the current climate. This however is a double-edged sword. Mail in voting is here to stay and we need to make sure we can compete with the Democrats. Q: It's daunting to knock on doors during a health pandemic. What has been the response like so far for those who are door-knocking? JM: Chairman Lyons and I have been crisscrossing the state, meeting with candidates and spending afternoons "on the bells," as Jim would say. I have yet to experience any push back because of the virus and our candidates are receiving tremendous responses. Knocking in a mask isn't always fun, especially in the recent weather, but our candidates are getting it done. Eleven MassGOP candidates to watch These 11 state Republican House candidates -- 10 upstarts and one incumbent -- is a group to watch for this fall. Each have stood out in their own way during the 2020 campaign season. Between racking up high door-knocking counts, amplifying a pro-Republican message, and finding ways to work around the new COVID-19 rules, this group stands to help usher in a new era of Republicans serving on Beacon Hill. Tatyana Semyrog, making her first run for state representative, is competing in the winnable 6th Plymouth House District. Tatyana, a refugee and mother of three from the former Soviety Union, is a natural workhorse who has already overcome more adversity than most of us will see in a lifetime. Tatyana writes: "Coming to America was the greatest gift for me. The freedom this country gives is a miracle. Sadly, it’s being chipped away. I'm greatly concerned by what I'm seeing happening to our beloved country. Freedom is so easy to lose and is nearly impossible to get back, as is evident in my former homeland." Alec DiFruscia of Tewksbury launched his campaign last fall with his sights set on knocking off a first-termer in the 19th Middlesex District, a region that has long opposed the sort of radical left-wing leadership now popular among entrenched Beacon Hill Democrats. Alec writes: "I’m not a career politician. I’ve worked in the private sector my whole life, so I feel the pain of endless taxes, too much regulation, and the impact of bad politics on our community. But I've always been a fighter. Now, I want to give back to the community that made me who I am. I will never vote for a tax increase, I can promise that now." Summer Schmaling, making her second run after a solid 2018 showing, is the chairman of the Halifax School Committee. She has knocked on more than 4,200 doors in the 12th Plymouth House District. Summer writes: “I’ve received a great deal of support and encouragement from voters to run for State Representative. The voters tell me taxes are too high and they want transparency on how their State Representative votes in Boston - these votes affect their families, jobs, and businesses.” Bob May, whose “MayDay” team is responsible for amplifying a popular Republican message in his hometown of Peabody, is running for an open seat. May, a businessman, is primed to become the first Republican in more than 40 years to represent the 13th Essex House District. Bob writes: "I see an opportunity to provide the business experience that is desperately needed on Beacon Hill. I want to apply the same common sense principles of business to the fiscal challenges facing the Commonwealth. I will be the leader you can count on to push back on the radical left-wing proposals that are gaining traction in the Legislature." Gardner resident Bruce Chester \-- retired Army National Guard captain, Operation Iraqi Freedom veteran, teacher, author. Bruce has been making a name for himself in the 2nd Worcester House District, and counts full police funding as part of his platform. Bruce writes: "I come from a proud family that has been a part of Central Massachusetts for generations. I've been a military leader and now I want to bring that leadership to my district. We need to not only improve the economy of the area but we must preserve the individual liberties that our military has sacrificed so much to maintain." Susan Smiley, running for the open 12th Worcester House District seat, has been involved in her hometown of Lancaster for years, having served on the Board of Selectmen. The Republican State Committeewoman was sworn-in last month to serve on the Lancaster Finance Committee. Susan writes: "Yes, I am Republican and my core principles reflect sound fiscal responsibility, understanding that we are a society of free individuals and that no one should be excluded from the opportunity to pursue their own economic success. Each individual and their contributions deserve fair and accountable government representation, with NO special treatment. I am a person who believes the rules should be the same for all and we are all equal." James "Chip" Harrington, of Ludlow, has been making the most of his campaign to win the open 7th Hampshire District House seat. Chip is a father of two and has carved out a rewarding career in corrections and law enforcement and currently serves on the Ludlow School Committee. Chip writes: "My love of this region and building community with others is what I am all about. From founding the Ludlow Football Association, to spearheading the effort to create the solar farm on the former Ludlow Landfill, to successfully advocating for all-day Kindergarten in my town, I am about building community and consensus to assure our people and our families succeed." Retired Army combat pilot Ingrid Centurion of Sudbury, the daughter of an Argentinian father and a Puerto Rican mother, has 22 years of active service under her belt. She has a deep love for her country and is determined to bring strong Republican leadership to the 13th Middlesex House District. Ingrid writes: "I have seen no sacrifice from the legislature like the private sector is experiencing. It is business as usual when it comes to government paychecks. As the next State Representative, I will be a forward thinking Representative -- not a go-along-to-get-along bench warmer." Frank Collins, a former U.S. Marine from Braintree, has helped organize rallies to "Back the Blue" in the Fifth Norfolk House District, and believes that Massachusetts men and women serving in law enforcement deserve our support, now more than ever. Frank writes: "These brave men and women go to work everyday to keep our communities safe. As your State Representative I will always back our law enforcement and will oppose efforts to hastily 'reform' our police with a bad bill that will make our streets less safe and put our officers lives in danger." Evan Gendreau of Westport, currently a research assistant at the Public Policy Center at UMass-Dartmouth, may be younger than most candidates but he sees that as an advantage. He has been busy making a name for himself in the Eighth Bristol House District. A native of Fall River, Evan believes there is a growing demand on the South Coast for common sense Republican leadership. Gendreau writes: "I am committed to listening to the concerns of people throughout the district, including teachers, law enforcement, business owners, and other members of the community. I will be a strong voice for Westport, Fall River, New Bedford, and Freetown." Rep. Nick Boldyga, who drew a surprise primary opponent, has proven himself to be one of the most reliable Republican voices on Beacon Hill. Rep. Boldyga deserves all of our help in 2020 as a show of our gratitude for his established conservative track record representing the 3rd Hampden House District. Nick writes: "Representing Agawam, Granville, and Southwick has been a privilege, and I love this job. I have a proven track record of putting people before politics. I've voted against misguided police reform legislation, and am a guaranteed vote against any and all tax increases. I am very proud to represent the citizens of our district at the State House and work on the issues that are crucial to our commonwealth." Expect to receive additional candidate briefs ahead of the Nov.3 general election, as we continue to identify and recognize candidates whose campaign work -- win or lose -- continues to inspire us all.

By Dennis Galvin (*Editor's note -- this column was written as the Massachusetts police reform package was in the process of advancing into conference committee, where it currently remains as of Aug. 12*) Recent legislation passed by the Massachusetts House of Representative (H4860) is an attack on the police in the commonwealth, not an effort to reform them. The legislative process was flawed from the start reflecting the most blatant political opportunism yet seen by an overwhelmingly left-wing Massachusetts state Legislature. The aim of this legislation was never to improve the accountability and quality of policing -- it was instead to restrict legitimate police action and thwart sensible and informed efforts to improve it by burying them under layers of political bureaucracy. The political intent of this legislation became apparent in the process used to bring this bill forward. Despite the fact that police reform efforts had been pending in the legislature for years, a crisis in another state (the death of George Floyd in Minnesota) was used to trigger a feigned crisis in Massachusetts. No public hearings were called and the parties with the most at stake, most prominently the average, peace loving taxpayer, were excluded from having input. The House bill creates the Massachusetts Police Standards and Training Commission, which will have overarching authority to establish training procedures and establish qualifications for police officer certification. It will have the authority to revoke and suspend certifications for individual police officers based on cause, prohibiting them from working temporarily or permanently in the state. These policies are not new ideas, they have been long advocated by police reformers, many of whom were current and former police officers, yet they languished for years on Beacon Hill. Additionally, reformers strongly advocated that the Commission be staffed by trained, knowledgeable law enforcement professionals. However, politics overruled professionalism, those with police experience are banned by this bill from appointment, so those completely unfamiliar with the police service will be evaluating performance and prescribing rules for training and conduct. Appointments will be political, made by the governor and attorney general. Neither Gov. Charlie Baker nor Attorney General Maura Healy can boast an overly impressive record of rooting out corruption. Consider their response to the State Police scandals both reacting with inaction and obfuscation. Meanwhile, the most significant impact will be felt on the streets. The bill will place significant restrictions on police use of force. Officers will only be allowed to use force to prevent “imminent harm”. In every case, they will be forced to justify, why de-escalation techniques either didn’t work or were inappropriate, leaving them open to a slew of legal action by opportunistic attorneys. It also appears that police officers can no longer conduct protective “pat downs” of suspects, who may be about to commit crimes, an action previously affirmed by the US Supreme Court in Terry v. Ohio. This provision will create a “chilling effect” among officers, causing them to hesitate in situations where they would otherwise have acted to prevent a crime. The bottom line is the House police reform bill is a product of a radical Democrat state Legislature that has taken over Massachusetts. To leftists, the police are nothing more than props in their theater of the politically absurd. They have no interest in building a professional force capable of consistently operating in a safe, effective and constitutional manner. Their intent is to set the police up for continual failure, and in so doing jeopardize the lives of not only conscientious police officers, but the innocent people, who depend upon them, as well. When Antifa comes to town and riots, kicking and punching grandma and grandpa trying to get to Walgreen’s for their meds, if the police stand and watch, like they did in Portland and Seattle, the Police Reform Bill of 2020 will be the reason why.

Chairman: Jim Lyons National Committeeman: Ron Kaufman National Committeewoman: Janet Fogarty Vice Chairman: Tom Mountain Treasurer: Patrick Crowley Secretary: KathyJo Boss Assistant Treasurer: Anthony Ventresca Assistant Secretary: Lindsay Valanzola Commentary from State Committeeman Dr. Jay Fleitman (Note: This piece originally ran in the Aug. 3 edition of the Hampshire Gazette) Three new video clips of Joe Biden surfaced on television news this week. In one of them, he was talking to three interviewers when he related a recent medical encounter he had in which a nurse leaned over and whispered in his ear that if anything medically serious would happen to him, that she could breathe up through his nose and bring him back to health. He found this to be amazing. I found this to be shocking. It is not clear what this medical encounter was about, it is not clear that it even happened, but it was clearly bizarre. The other two clips that I also saw on television was one of a recent speech in which he clearly did not know where he was, and another in which he was answering a question about the 2020 census, and in his answer he added the qualification that it happened two or three years ago. These are not lovable Joe Biden gaffes. I have been involved in patient care for over 40 years, and have no doubt that these are signs of significant cognitive defects. I don’t know if Joe Biden has Alzheimer’s disease, but he clearly has a degenerative neurological disorder in which dementia is a part. If Biden, who turns 78 on Nov. 20, is elected he will be the oldest president to win the office, and older than Ronald Reagan was when he left the presidency just before he turned 78. Donald Trump, who was the oldest person to assume the presidency at age 70 in 2016, turned 74 in June. This is not necessarily purely an age-related issue, but Biden appears not to be aging well. And Democrats know this. So far the Biden campaign is one in absentia. It is a hidden campaign, in which he has been kept mostly hidden from view, never answering questions at press conferences, and otherwise only making public statements that are funneled through his campaign team. After all, the campaign has problems with Biden statements like his recent claim that 120 million Americans have died of COVID. The Democrat on the street knows this as well, though no one wants to name it. I have overheard several conversations in which people who clearly support the Biden campaign expressed the hope that he stays out of public, does little speaking, does not engage in any debates, and that they are sure that the Democrats will surround a prospective President Biden with a well-functioning team if he wins. Biden, of course, cannot be replaced on the ticket. He won the nomination in the primaries, and if he were to be removed, Bernie Sanders supporters would demand that their man has the rightful claim to the candidacy. Electing a medically precarious president has precedence. Franklin Roosevelt ran for a fourth term in 1944, and everyone around him knew he was dying. He ran again, and the Democratic Party ran him again, even though it was clear he did not have long to live. He was sworn in in January 1945, and died in April 1945. He selected Harry Truman as his running mate for vice president, not with the thought that he would make for a good president when Roosevelt died, but only out of consideration that he did not damage the ticket’s chance of winning. The Democrats had to win, and the well-being of the country came second. The country was lucky that Truman turned out to be a very good president. The parallels to the Biden campaign are clear, and we are awaiting his choice for a vice presidential running mate. I hope his team is looking for someone who will be a competent chief executive to take over if Biden becomes untenable in the position. It seems that the search has other criteria. Whoever is making this decision seems to have restricted the choice to “women of color.” This is intended at this fractious time to ensure that minorities are included in the nation’s power structure, but it in fact excludes from consideration other available candidates of different ethnicities and gender at a time when the presidential candidate himself is likely impaired. Maybe I am all wrong, and we will see a sharp Joe Biden in the debates. The Democratic leaning press and media often raise questions of Trump’s competency to be president. He is characterized as being narcissistic, blustery, erratic, and unintelligent or uninterested. It is impossible to be outside the White House and Trump’s personal orbit to know what if any of this is true. So please don’t get me wrong, I’m not giving my side a pass on questionable behavior, but I am asking Democrats not to turn a blind eye to what is in plain sight about Joe Biden for president. The Massachusetts Republican Party is proud to announce the launch of a new coalition devoted to amplifying the voices of Republican veterans. In the Q&A below, John MacDonald, an Air Force veteran who served during the Operation Desert Storm, answers several questions regarding the purpose of the coalition and details on its founding. Q: This idea of yours -- to offer Massachusetts veterans a MassGOP-backed coalition, essentially a vehicle to advocate for candidates they believe will fight to improve the policies that affect them most -- was there anything in particular that prompted you to come up with this? A: As a veterans advocate, for years I have spoken with my fellow veterans who have expressed aggravation with politicians and often misguided policies that effect veterans benefits. “Those who don’t serve, don’t know. Sometimes those who don’t know… don’t care.” Those veterans that have served our country abroad, most often recognize the stark difference between the United States of America, its values and moral compass, versus many… many other places in the world that do not offer the same freedoms or values, which we have fought to preserve here in the United States. Veterans took an oath to protect the country and the constitution. Fighting for candidates and elected officials that believe in our state and country is a natural for veterans. Harnessing the power of our mutual bond seems like a natural fit with the MassGOP. Coming together and finding an outlet to express this I believe will be a valuable resource for the MassGOP, the commonwealth and country. Q: You served during the first Gulf War. After you returned to civilian life, when did you start getting involved politically? A: I have been paying attention to politics most of my life. Serving my country affirmed my belief in our country. I saw many of the failed policies of the Clinton Administration related to the military adversely affect people I served with by way of base closures and force reductions. Locally I became active, volunteering to help local city council candidates when I purchased my first home in 1998. I became politically active with national politics in the 2000 Presidential election. I had volunteered for the McCain 2000 campaign and then the George W. Bush campaign. That’s where it all began. What are some of the greatest challenges facing veterans in 2020 and beyond? Protecting and preserving the benefits already promised to our veterans is number one. Finding effective treatments and hopefully a cure for PTSD, while reducing veteran suicide is number 1A. Making sure the country remains committed to the constitution and remains free of socialism and communism is another high priority. This project is in its infancy, but what do you see as crucial to getting it up and running? Awareness of the opportunity is critical for veterans. Communication has always been one of the biggest problems for the veteran community in general. Creating this coalition is an opportunity for veterans to organize and harness their energies to protect our state and country from radical progressive Democrats. Signing up and making themselves know to the MassGOP is the key, then organizing ourselves by district and putting those resources to work will be key. Action, less talk… and fast. Do you think American Legions and other brick-and-mortar type establishments are becoming outdated? Veterans clubs are seeing dwindling memberships and have been for years. They have their own challenges, which they need to resolve. COVID 19 will cause many clubs to remain closed permanently. These clubs have value, but they need to find ways to remain relevant and accessible to younger veterans. The MassGOP Veterans Coalition might be able to brainstorm on this and come up with actionable ideas. As best as you can describe -- what’s your vision for this new organization? Where do you see it five years from today? I see the MassGOP as a broad coalition of veteran activists and a bullpen for future political candidates. Sharing information, better communication, producing veteran legislation, fighting against bad legislation and organizing veterans into a coalition will have a profound positive impact of local, state and federal elections. What can people do to get involved? (Talk about how we are setting up a Facebook page, how people can expect a press release within the coming weeks providing links to the Facebook page and a Twitter account to follow that we’ll set up.) They can get involved by signing up for the Veterans Coalition through the MassGOP portal here. Spreading the word to their fellow veterans will be key. I will encourage all interested veterans to share the information via social media. Republican activity around the Commonwealth "Back the Blue" rallies, candidate events, and more On Aug. 9, the Westford Republican Town Committee held its "Back the Blue" rally to celebrate local law enforcement, an event Westford resident and Republican State Committeewoman Kathy Lynch said drew hundreds of cheering supporters. "It's time for people to stand up for their country," Lynch wrote on Facebook. "Defend all those who take an oath to follow the Constitution!" The Billerica Republican Town Committee and Republican State Committeeman Anthony Ventresca helped promote and host a campaign fundraiser on Aug. 6 for Congressional candidate John Paul Moran. Recently elected Massachusetts Republican Party Vice Chairman Tom Mountain reports that the MA Trump Campaign event in Wellesley was a success: "We managed to keep our numbers under 100 at the home of MA RNC Delegate Ginny Greiman, with State Committee Members, 2020 Delegates, and even a makeshift reunion of 2016 Delegates, all joined together to support the re-election of our President. MA Trump Campaign Chair Sheriff Tom Hodgson, National Committeewoman Janet Fogarty, State Committeewomen Patricia Saint Aubin and Amy Carnevale and yours truly welcomed our Republican crowd that included Senate Candidate Kevin O’Connor, Congressional Candidates John Paul Moran, Julie Hall, Tracy Lovvron, and State Rep Candidates Ingrid Centurion and Frank Collins, along with State Committee Members Nathan Bech, Susan Huffman, Evelyn Curley, Paul Ronkaitus, and Steve Fruzzetti. All in all, a great time was had by all!" The East Bridgewater Republican Town Committee writes on Facebook: "We'd like to thank the residents of East Bridgewater for the out pouring of support over the last few weeks. We aren't charging for these signs, but many folks have donated to the committee to offset the cost, and we appreciate that. Money raised will go back to local Republican candidates this fall." The Orange Republican Town Committee recently shared Republican state Rep. candidate Ingrid Centurion's letter calling on Gov. Charlie Baker to veto police reform legislation: Dear Governor Baker, I am writing to encourage you to veto the Police Reform bill that is now in conference committee. Being multicultural, I understand the anger of the minority community concerning the death of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer. It should have never happened. I am pleased that police officer is now being held accountable by our judicial system. However, our Massachusetts police force did not cause the death of George Floyd. Unfortunately, they have been lumped into this anger and are being treated like they are racists just because they wear a blue uniform. That’s wrong. While every agency is far from perfect and can use reform from time to time, the Police Reform bill goes way too far. By removing qualified immunity, the state would be penalizing good officers. The ultimate result will be massive retirements as we have seen in New York. Recruitment of new officers will be non-existent. Our public safety will be jeopardized if this bill becomes law. As a mother of two boys and as a daughter who cares for an elderly mother, I want someone to be there when I call 911. I hope that you will veto the bill and support public safety for the Commonwealth. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

View this email in your browser Hi Friends, We hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been at least 4,151 coronavirus related deaths in New Jersey’s long-term care facilities including many at the state’s only veterans’ nursing home. That represents more than half of all COVID-19 related deaths in New Jersey to date. It is well documented that since the start of April, Governor Murphy and the New Jersey Department of Health have been ordering nursing homes to accept admissions even if the person was confirmed with a case of COVID19. Despite pleas and warnings from facility managers, the Murphy Administration has continued to send infectious patients to unprepared facilities. New Jersey Republican State Committee Chairman Doug Steinhardt is calling for a legislative investigation into this ongoing crisis. “Our senior population is the most vulnerable demographic to this pandemic and it appears that Governor Murphy has cost thousands their lives and jeopardized the lives of an untold number more,” said Steinhardt. “The NJGOP calls upon the Senate President and Assembly Speaker to convene swift and thorough hearings into the Administration’s handling of New Jersey’s long term care facilities, what the State knew, when, and why New Jersey’s senior population was exposed to these risks.” NJGOP In The News! # Steinhardt says Murphy holding back small business aid to plug budget holes Republican State Chairman Doug Steinhardt is accusing Gov. Phil Murphy withholding almost $2 billion in CARES Act dollars from the Coronavirus Relief Fund that could be used to help struggling New Jersey residents and businesses. “Governor Murphy is sitting on a nearly $2 billion mountain of money that could save New Jersey small businesses, and he’s lying to all of us about it,” Steinhardt alleged. “Murphy is hoarding it hoping he can use it to balance his bloated budget.” Read more...

Join us is calling for him to release it! 🔦Legislative Spotlight🔦 Assemblyman Scharfenberger: Follow ‘common sense’ protocols to reopen New Jersey Assemblyman Gerry Scharfenberger (R-Monmouth) has composed a set of what he is calling common sense protocols small businesses could implement to start down the road to safe economic recovery as the 2020 coronavirus pandemic continues to grip the state. In a May 7 press release, he said, “Without a doubt, the impact which COVID-19 has had on New Jersey’s health and economic well-being has been overwhelming. “However, by Trenton failing to offer residents a detailed reopening plan and delays continuing with unemployment claims, it only grows their heavy concerns; they deserve to have clarity in a strategy for the future. “That is why today I, along with several of my colleagues in the Assembly, have authored a set of common sense recommendations for virtually every business in New Jersey that will allow them to begin operating safely, while protecting those most vulnerable among us,” Scharfenberger said. “People are in danger of losing their homes, their livelihood and their way of life. This has to end, we need to show them there is light at the end of the tunnel,” he said. Scharfenberger, who said he was cognizant of the hardships already facing New Jersey’s small businesses and residents, said the economic burdens would continue to increase with each day officials delay. “New Jersyans have endured unprecedented job losses, business closings and mandatory lockdowns, and have nobly sacrificed freedoms in the name of public health. “We owe it to them to offer a plan that seeks to reopen the economy and allow them to get back to work for their own financial health. “When owners and employees are dependent upon a business for their livelihood and to put food on the table for their families, there is no such thing as a ‘non-essential’ business. “As such, it is imperative that we begin the steady process of reopening New Jersey’s economy,” Scharfenberger said.

Alex, It’s hard to believe the election is only 5 days away. That means we only have 5 more days to get the word out about our candidates. I know our candidates will put Vermonters over special interests. I know our candidates will fight to lower our tax burden. I know our candidates will create jobs & grow the economy. I know our candidates will fiercely defend the Constitution. The problem is, not all Vermonters know about our candidates. That’s why I’ve set a goal to raise $10,000 before Election Day to help us reach 100,000 voters and get the word out about our candidates. It’s more important than ever before to make sure our candidates have the support they need.

It’s time that average Vermonters like us stand up and use our vote to put common sense leaders back in the House and Senate.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 13th, 2020 Contact: Deb Billado Vermont Republican Party Starts Multi-Station Ad Buy Berlin, VT -- Tuesday morning thousands of Vermonters listened in as the Vermont Republican Party began a multi-station radio campaign across Vermont, getting on the airwaves from Alburg to Vernon. “The Vermont Republican Party is working together like never before," said Chair Deb Billado. "We are in a much better place than we were two years ago - even just 6 months ago. In light of COVID we were forced to think a little differently, and that has thankfully resulted in us working together more cooperatively, from the Governor's office down to local candidates." The Vermont Republicans are using the new radio ads to capitalize on the unprecedented popularity and unrivaled success of Republican Governor Phil Scott. A recent VPR/VPBS poll showed the Governor Scott's 68% approval rating, making him even more popular than longtime Democrat officeholders like Peter Welch and Sen. Patrick Leahy. "The message is simple," added Political Director Paul Dame, "If Vermonters like the job Governor Scott is doing - then we are asking them to help him get that job done by electing more common sense Vermont Republicans like him who are going to cooperate with him - not work against him." While Democrats have tried to appear more cooperative this year, in the last election year a Seven Days reporter caught Senate Democrats violating open meeting laws to conspire how to thwart Governor Scott, intentionally passing bills for the purpose of getting his veto - not making life better for Vermonters. "We're still in somewhat of a crisis management situation," added Billado. "The Governor has no doubt done the best job in the country in preventing some really dire situations here in Vermont. But we can do better. If he had a legislature that had the experience and the incentive to see him succeed, like Republican House and Senate candidates do - instead of see him and our state fail - the way that the Democrat Party would like to see, then we could not only stop the spread of the virus, but actually start the spread of a more prosperous economy." Vermont Republicans have made post-COVID economic recovery their #1 goal and believe with a popular proven Governor they have made the case to voters to give their down-ballot candidates a serious look. Even local small businessman Scott Milne, the Republican candidate in a close race for Lt. Gov. is hoping to benefit from the ads that encourage voters to elect him and other Republicans to help strengthen Governor Scott's hand on election day. "There are voters out there who usually vote for Democrats, but they know that this time - for this election - we may need a few more of the Common Sense Vermont-style Republicans to balance things out and get us back on track with the economy." said Billado.

Reflecting on this somber anniversary Connecticut Democrats Alex, it’s been two years since the unspeakable violence at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Connecticut deeply understands the devastation and lasting trauma that gun violence brings. Today, Parkland is in our thoughts — as are all of the other communities in the United States that have been affected by gun violence. But as we reflect on this somber anniversary, we must affirm that thoughts and prayers are not enough. We must honor the 17 lives lost in Parkland with decisive action. In the two years since this tragedy, Parkland’s young people have launched a national movement to prevent future gun violence — and progress has been made. Here in Connecticut, Democrats and Republicans came together last year to build upon our assault weapons ban and background check requirements. We passed legislation to ban untraceable ghost guns and require that guns are stored safely. Now it’s time for the federal government to recognize that guns do not obey borders. We need common sense federal gun violence prevention legislation, and it’s time for Republicans at the national level to join Democrats in taking action. If we all work together, we can prevent future tragedies and create safer communities in every state. We owe it to our children, and we owe it to every American who has been a victim of gun violence.

Friends, Fifteen days ago, just north of our state, an American citizen was murdered in the street, in broad daylight, on video, by officers sworn to protect and serve their community. And fifteen days later, the streets of Iowa communities and cities across America are filled with justifiable anger, anguish, and frustration. George Floyd was murdered in Minneapolis. But it could have easily have been a man in Mason City. It could have happened in Des Moines, Dubuque, or Davenport - in Council Bluffs or Cedar Falls. It could have happened in Iowa because like too many communities and too many states in America, appropriate legislation does not exist to protect our people. Last week, Iowa House Democrats introduced three common sense proposals to make our state and our union more perfect and we need your help to make it a reality. We understand that no one law can end racism or end the inequality that we face overnight. But today, we can begin to respond to this crisis, to bring justice for George Floyd, and work toward a day where no Iowan has to live in fear of becoming another hashtag. The Plan for a More Perfect Union will: * Protect Iowa citizens by ensuring that no Iowan is held in a chokehold by law enforcement. * Make sure Iowa communities stay safe by banning police departments from hiring officers who were previously fired or resigned because of misconduct. * Bring justice to more Iowans by ensuring that Iowa's Attorney General has the power to investigate misconduct. This bill can pass but we have to act quickly. Can you take a few moments today to: * Sign our petition * Send to 3 friends * Share on Facebook and Twitter * Call your State Senator (515-281-3371) and State Representative (515-281-3221) and let them know you support a plan for a more perfect union This bill won’t bring back George Floyd, but it’s something Iowa lawmakers can do right this moment to help establish justice for Black communities. Now is the time to turn the apathy of some into action of many. Now is when we turn our pain into progress and our outrage into organizing. Now, with this plan, is when we turn our organizing into ordinances that make our state and our union fairer, more just, and more perfect. In solidarity, State Representative Ras Smith Paid for by the Iowa Democratic Party.

Dear Alex, Did you see Kansas Dems on KSNT yesterday? While discussing the Presidential Primary, political analyst Dr. Bob Beatty highlighted the success of our mail-in operation, stating: “The Democratic Party of Kansas was able to put on an election during a pandemic, that’s remarkable. And what it really shows is how mail-in elections, or mail-in voting, is probably the future for the United States, let alone the future of Kansas.” We couldn’t have said it better ourselves. Kansas Democrats had a unique opportunity on May 2 to demonstrate how mail-in voting can protect voters and our Democracy during even the most uncertain of times - and they came through, big time. While Donald Trump and his GOP allies across the country are blocking election reforms before November, Kansas Democrats more than tripled their 2016 turnout to unequivocally prove that vote-by-mail during a pandemic is just common sense. We shattered previous turnout records during the 2020 Primary. Can you help us capitalize on our growing momentum by chipping in $20, $35, or $50? Your donation will help us harness Democratic enthusiasm and build a robust 2020 Coordinated Campaign to materialize victories up and down the ballot in 2020. Kansas Democrats have a real chance to make historic wins in Kansas this election year, and with your help, we will end the Republican super majority in the Kansas Legislature, win a U.S. Senate Seat, expand our representation in our U.S. Congress, and, last but not least, make Donald Trump a one-term president. Donate today to help us make history again on November 3, 2020. Onward, KDP Team P.S.

Dr. Shelley Made a Plan While Gov. Burgum Made Excuses Dem-NPL gubernatorial candidate Dr. Shelley Lenz's campaign was recently highlighted in several different news articles - such as this one from the Minot Daily News that covers the five different candidates currently running for governor. The Dickinson Press also published an overview of her campaign and why she is running to unseat Gov. Burgum. Lenz said, “(Burgum) didn’t understand that the way we support our oil industry — and the same with our ag industry, but I’m out west — is through thriving communities, and stable communities. What does that take? That is child care, health care, education, rent. … You invest in things that bring stability to a community, which is the working families.” Zach Raknerud Fights for Working Families, While Armstrong Remains a Partisan The Minot Daily News recently published an article about the race for North Dakota's At-Large congressional district featuring three candidates, incumbent Rep. Kelly Armstrong, Libertarian Steven Peterson, and Dem-NPL candidate Zach Raknerud. Several main planks of Raknerud's platform are highlighted, including his positions on coronavirus relief, childcare costs, and universal healthcare. Raknerud said, “We are really hamstringing entrepreneurship in this country because people are stuck at jobs that they loathe because it provides them health care coverage and they can’t risk it. If we had Medicare cover everybody as a baseline, it would really open up our economy in a big way, where folks could take the leap of entrepreneurship.” Read more here.

Dear folks, I wanted to provide a short update on how we are adjusting and operating in light of the coronavirus crisis and the rapidly changing conditions it is causing. For us, and we hope for you, priority one must be protecting health -- of voters, volunteers, staff and the public at large. At this critical moment, we all have a responsibility to flatten the curve of the spread of this virus. At the same time, we continue to have a duty to protect the right to vote in the upcoming election and the responsibility to support our candidates, at every level, as we head into the fall campaign season. Weighing those factors, here are several key areas we are addressing. Polling Locations Almost 130 polling locations have been closed because they house vulnerable populations. Replacement locations are being identified, and we are working to contact the non-resident voters -- by mail and/or phone -- to inform them of their new polling places. These locations will also be posted on [[URL REDACTED]] as quickly as possible. Finally, we will send volunteers out on Primary Election Day to ensure that signs are in place at each closed polling place that inform voters where the new polling place is located. How you can help: Encourage people to go to [[URL REDACTED]] to confirm their polling location. Voting Early Given the general worry about long lines and large-scale interactions, we are strongly encouraging people to vote early. Early in-person vote locations are generally less crowded, and absentee ballots will be counted as long as they are postmarked by Monday, March 16, or returned in person to your county board of elections by Tuesday, March 17, at 7:30 p.m. How you can help: Encourage people to vote early -- find out more at [[URL REDACTED]] Poll Workers There is currently a troubling shortage of poll workers, particularly as more senior poll workers opt out.

Facebook If you encounter challenges or problems regarding voting in your community, please reach out to Voter Protection Director Gretchen Bennett at [[URL REDACTED]] Look Out for One Another More broadly, global health crises like the COVID-19 outbreak remind us of the importance of looking out for one another and using common sense to keep our communities safe. Besides frequently washing your hands and staying home when you're sick, there are several actions you can take to show support to your community: * Call your neighbors and loved ones who are at greater risk (if they are older or have pre-existing illnesses). * Donate to your local food bank to help out folks who are experiencing food insecurity (click here to donate to the Ohio Association of Food Banks). * If using home delivery services, tip well! If you have to discontinue a cleaning service or child care, continue to pay these service workers as you would normally, if you are financially able. Ohio can be an example to the rest of the country of how to respond to pandemics -- so let's listen to public health experts and do our part to flatten the curve. Stay safe, David Pepper Chair Ohio Democratic Party signature TRUMP WATCH Trump Is Fumbling the Coronavirus Response Instead of providing solutions that would help American families, Donald Trump's address to the nation was filled with inaccuracies, sowed confusion among Americans and failed to provide solutions to critical problems, such as insufficient testing. Trump continues to irresponsibly downplay the danger to Americans, and he has seized on the crisis to push his own political agenda. Twitter Even as the coronavirus spread, Trump proposed cutting funding to Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and global health programs. Trump eliminated critical staff who would have been responsible for leading the U.S. response to deadly pandemics, and the NSC's director for medical and biodefense preparedness remains unfilled. Twitter Meanwhile, the Trump administration is backing a lawsuit to overturn the Affordable Care Act, has failed to offer clarity on whether coronavirus testing will be classified as a guaranteed "essential health benefit" that insurers must cover, and has expanded "junk" insurance plans that don't have to cover these benefits. OHIO DEMS IN THE HEADLINES Workers Need Paid Sick Leave Ohio House Democratic lawmakers announced their support of a plan by U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown and Senate Democrats to create a temporary federal paid sick leave program that would lessen the economic impact of a widespread coronavirus outbreak. Facebook The Paid Sick Days for Public Health Emergencies and Personal Family Care Act would require all employers to allow workers to accrue seven days of paid sick days and to provide an additional 14 days available immediately in the event of any public health emergency, including the current coronavirus crisis. Facebook "Best practices, like washing hands and staying home from work if you're sick are our first and best line of defense to contain the spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus. However, the fact remains that too many Ohioans are living paycheck-to-paycheck and simply cannot afford to stay home from work for an extended period of time," House Democratic Leader Emilia Strong Sykes said. "That's why we urged the governor earlier this week to release emergency funding to lessen the economic impact on working families, and why we echo that call today, urging the swift passage of emergency legislation offered by Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown. This is a public health crisis as well as an economic crisis -- and we need to act immediately and urgently to protect both the physical and economic health of everyday Ohioans."

Whether you're out protesting, registering voters or simply going to the grocery store, we hope you'll wear these masks with pride. Ohio Democratic Party Hey team, There are some folks on the right who want us to believe that wearing masks somehow makes us less free -- but the vast majority of Americans know that when we all wear masks, the rate of coronavirus transmission drops dramatically. The Ohio Democratic Party wants you and your family to stay safe, and we'd like to send a message that Democrats are proud to take this common sense step -- so we've launched a new line of masks in our online store. Whether you're out protesting, registering voters or simply going to the grocery store, we hope you'll wear these masks with pride. (Psst -- half of all proceeds from our entire mask collection will go to support the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus, whose members are fighting to make our state the first to declare racism a public health crisis.) masks But don't wait -- these union-printed, made-in-the-USA masks are available for a limited time only!

Hi Friend, Another week, another VDP Community Call! This week, as part of our ongoing "Meet the Candidates" series, we'll be welcoming Representative Peter Welch to the call.

Peter's record reflects his strong commitment to bringing people together to find common sense solutions to the difficult challenges facing our state and nation. In an era of partisanship, he has worked across the aisle to create jobs, increase access to affordable education and health care, invest in energy efficiency, protect our environment, and care for our veterans. Come meet Rep. Peter Welch this Friday 9/11 from 7-8pm! VDP Community Calls happen every Friday from 7-8pm and offer a space for us to come together and share with our Democratic community here in Vermont.

So long as Black men and women cannot breathe, we cannot rest. DemocratsJoin us. Friend, I’m writing to you this afternoon about the killing of George Floyd -- another tragic case of the violence Black men face in America every single day. No person of character and common sense can watch the video footage of what police did to George Floyd without being horrified. And yet, this president has done nothing to heal those wounds. Instead, he has sown division and advocated violence against protestors, rather than condemning the racist violence that spurred these protests in the first place. We will not heal as a nation through silence -- but through justice, through progress, through activism and action. George Floyd is the name we’re chanting today. Yesterday it was Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. Before that it was Botham Jean, Eric Garner, Philando Castile, Walter Scott, Tamir Rice, Michael Brown, Sandra Bland, Alton Sterling, Freddie Gray, Laquan McDonald. We will keep saying their names. We will keep honoring their lives. And we will keep seeking justice for their families -- and the families of those whose tragedies weren’t captured on video -- by fighting to end police brutality and the institutional racism that pervades every aspect of our society. So long as Black men and women cannot breathe, we cannot rest. Thank you.

Alex -- Liberate Minnesota will be hosting another opportunity for you to protest Gov. Walz. Please join us tomorrow Sunday April 26th from 12-3 as we call out to Gov. Walz to Liberate Minnesota and set us free. The longer this unnecessary shut down of our state continues the more likely that our election will become compromised. You may participate in your car as hundreds will pass by the governors residence or join us on the sidewalk. Here is the address: 1006 Summit Ave St. Paul If you are unable to join us you can call the governor's residence during this time. 651-201-3464 Thank you! Michele [[URL REDACTED]] In case you missed yesterday's email: Last week, great patriots from MAGASOTA held a beautiful protest at the governor’s residence in St. Paul calling on him to end the excessive quarantine and Liberate Minnesota! The response was amazing. The left wing Fake News reported only a few hundred participants, but Minnesotans know it was nearly 3,000 freedom loving citizens, whose lives, income and freedom are being shattered from this unconstitutional shutdown by Gov. Walz. Our Liberate Minnesota movement was for every citizen in the state of Minnesota regardless of political affiliation. All jobs are essential for working families. All workers are essential. Our family businesses are essential. Truth is, mainstream media has been silent in covering the devastating impact on businesses, workers, independent contractors and families! They ignore the fact that Minnesotans are smart and have common sense! We want Minnesotans to be able to go back to work safely and so we suggest doing what our mothers taught us, wash your hands, stay home if you’re unwell or are at risk, the things Minnesotans already do. Instead of acknowledging that Minnesotans are smart and industrious, the media and Gov. Walz would rather use their platform to shame and guilt you. It is their aim to turn neighbor against neighbor, family against family, all the while saying we are “One Minnesota”. This “One Minnesota” approach has removed our identity, individual needs, situations and personal stories. That’s why supporters of MAGASOTA drove, stood and marched in front of the Governor’s mansion demanding this tyranny end now! But I haven’t mentioned the best part! Friday, as we were setting up for the protest, our wonderful President Donald Trump tweeted his total and complete support of our efforts! We appreciate and are grateful to President Trump for the great interest and effort he is putting into Minnesota. In the midst of this Chinese Virus, we believe President Trump is giving us the opportunity to expose our own tyrannical state leadership and to step forward and save our state from socialism. Now is our time! Shortly after the rally, I went on Fox and Friends with Pete Hegseth to explain the dire situation that Minnesotans are in and expose how our economy and individual freedoms are being destroyed. (You can watch the video by going to the bottom of this email) We the people must step forward and save this Constitutional Republic. President Trump does so much for us, but only We The People have the power to stop tyranny and take control of our government! So please consider a major financial contribution to help MAGASOTA push forward in this fight for freedom! Whether you can do $5 or $500, we need your help now! The longer Gov. Walz pushes this excessive quarantine, the more families suffer, the more personal incomes plummet and the more small businesses will shutter their doors forever. So please click this link and make a generous contribution today! We’ll have more updates coming very shortly, as MAGASOTA rolls out a major program to help safely reopen Minnesota and get our friends and family back to work. Until then. please stand up for your freedom and liberty with us! God Bless America! -Michele P.S. MAGASOTA just held a massive rally for our freedom in front of the Governor’s mansion as President Trump Tweeted his wonderful support! We have a big fight on our hands to get Minnesotans safely and smartly back to work and carry Minnesota for President Trump.

# When I decided to run for Senate, I knew it would be an uphill climb, Alex. The corporate special interests who have captured Washington for too long will spend any amount of money to keep their grip on power. And since I got into this race, that's exactly what they've done — to the tune of over $26 million on attack ads here in Montana. In my time as Montana's Governor, we've been able to look past the partisan food fights to bring people from across the state together around issues that matter to all of us. We've worked with Republicans and Democrats alike to expand affordable health care, protect our public lands and outdoor spaces, and pass one of the strongest campaign finance laws in the country. That kind of common sense is exactly what scares the big corporate interests into opening their wallets. They're spending big to stop us from bringing Montana values to Washington. We have just one week until our August fundraising deadline and our campaign isn't taking any money from corporate PACs. Instead, we're counting on contributions from people like you to reach our goal. Will you make a donation today to help? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $10 now Chip in $25 now Chip in $50 now Chip in $100 now Chip in $250 now Another Amount Washington is a place where talking about something has become a substitute for doing something. That's no accident. Big corporate interests spend millions to keep it that way. I'm running for Senate to change that and make real progress on the issues that matter to all of us — just like we've done here in Montana. Thank you for making this campaign possible. I know that together, we can make a real difference in people's lives both here in Montana and across the country. — Steve PAID FOR BY MONTANANS FOR BULLOCK This email was sent to: [[EMAIL_REDACTED]].

# Alex, Right now, a bunch of Washington-based groups are pouring millions into Montana. They're running attack ads about my record that, to put it plainly, are just flat-out false. Here's the truth: As Governor, I've worked with Republicans and Democrats alike to get things done for all Montanans. We have expanded affordable health care, protected our public lands, and passed one of the strongest campaign finance laws in the country. If you can, consider donating to our campaign before tonight's important end-of-month deadline to help us overcome these attacks and win this race: If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $10 now Chip in $25 now Chip in $50 now Chip in $100 now Chip in $250 now Another Amount The thing is, working across party lines always just seemed like common sense to me. Why wouldn't we work with anyone and everyone who is interested in improving people's lives? But that's not how Washington works these days. Instead, it runs on big corporate interests and dark money. And these groups will spend whatever it takes to keep the wheels churning in their favor. I'm running for Senate to get big money out of our politics and bring a common-sense attitude to Washington. And with all this outside money pouring in, we're counting on donations from folks like you to win. That's why I'm asking: Will you pitch in whatever you can ahead of tonight's end-of-month deadline? We'll put your contribution to work right away building a winning campaign: If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $10 now Chip in $25 now Chip in $50 now Chip in $100 now Chip in $250 now Another Amount In this election, we have an opportunity to make a real difference in people's lives both here in Montana and across the country.

If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $10 now Chip in $25 now Chip in $50 now Chip in $100 now Chip in $250 now Another Amount Growing up in Helena, I wasn't focused much on politics. When the Big Sky is your backyard, there are more interesting things for a kid to do. I made my pocket money the same way a lot of kids my age did: I delivered newspapers before school. It was while I was out delivering papers that I first saw the governor's house. If it wasn't on my route, I don't think I would have known it was there. But it was my love for the Big Sky that years later inspired me to run for public office in the first place. I know that there is something special and irreplaceable about this place we call home, and I've dedicated my life to protecting our Montana lands and values. Now, my wife and I are raising our kids in the same house I once delivered newspapers to. As Governor, I've worked with folks from both sides of the aisle to get things done for Montana. Together we've strengthened our economy, expanded access to quality healthcare, invested in public schools, and created job training and career opportunities for the next generation. And as Montana's next Senator, I will bring our Montana values — common sense, unity, family, and good old-fashioned hard work — to Washington, to get things done for working folks and families across the country. But I can't get there without your help. Our campaign is facing a big test in just a few days — our last end-of-month fundraising deadline.

# VoteVets Team, Yesterday, the U.S. Senate passed the Great American Outdoors Act and by doing so guaranteed permanent full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This common sense, bi-partisan legislation is a huge win for our nation’s public lands, veterans, military families, civilians — a win for everybody. Now it's time to get this bill over the finish line. Will you add your name today in support of our nation’s cherished public lands? SIGN ON Now that the Senate has passed the Great American Outdoors Act, we’re calling on the House of Representatives to act quickly and send this legislation to the President's desk for his signature. Our engagement in this campaign should come as no surprise. Whether Earl Shaffer, a WWII veteran and the first person to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail or President Teddy Roosevelt, New York Army National Guard veteran and unwavering conservationist, veterans have a long-standing relationship with public lands and the outdoors. That’s why we recently teamed-up with seven retired general officers in their calls to protect our public lands and fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a bipartisan program that has invested $18.4 billion to preserve battlefields and other historic sites, protect iconic places from Grand Canyon National Park to the Appalachian Trail, and has supported 42,000 state and local projects -- at least one in every county, in every state in the country. Will you add your name today in support of our nation’s cherished public lands? SIGN ON In addition to the healing qualities our public lands provide, passing the Great American Outdoors Act and fully funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund will also be a critical tool in helping our economy recover -- stimulating tourism and generating a U.S. outdoor recreation economy to the tune of $887 billion in consumer spending and helping to create 7.6 million jobs. All without costing the American taxpayer a dime. We’re almost to the finish line because of the advocacy of so many of you -- veterans, military families, and allies -- throughout the country and in the halls of Congress in Washington, D.C. We’re almost there but we’re not done yet. Join us! SIGN ON Thanks for all you do. — The Team at VoteVets * * * PAID FOR BY VOTEVETS ACTION FUND This email was sent to [[EMAIL_REDACTED]].

Alex, I'm not sure if you saw, but I wanted to highlight one our latest endorsements: Jonathan Kassa. Jonathan is running for State Representative in HD151, located in Montgomery County, and we're so excited to have him on the Kennedy Democrats team. He's fighting for a better education system, making sure that the families of our state can afford to put food on their table and have access to quality healthcare, and he's running with a great mantra in mind: Common sense is not political. He's right, and unfortunately common sense is a pretty rare thing to find in politics these days. But we're certain that the candidates we've endorsed, like Jonathan, are going to change that. Like we've done with many of our other candidates this month, we're committed to matching your contributions that are made to Jonathan at this link. He has just a few hours left until his midnight fundraising deadline, and we want to make sure he has all the support he needs. If you're ready to see PA go blue, will you chip in $50, $25, or $10 to support Jonathan Kassa today?

Sign the platform: Demand federal, state and local officials protect incarcerated people from COVID-19. Color Of Change Member, Mass incarceration is now more than ever a massive public health crisis--and officials must act NOW to save lives.1 Coronavirus has already started to make its way into jails, prisons, and immigrant detention centers. The first incarcerated person to test positive for Coronavirus is in Long Island’s county jail and hasn’t been released to medical care. And now a second incarcerated person has contracted the virus on Rikers Island.2,3 Here’s why that’s terrifying: jails, prisons, and immigrant detention centers are sites of overcrowding, poor sanitation, and pest infestations, all of which make these cages incubators for disease. Incarcerated people are packed into close quarters and forced to share spaces such as bathrooms and showers. And worst of all, our folks are not given the basic necessities like soap, hand sanitizer, and other medical supplies. So how could we expect these places to care for them during a global pandemic? Not to mention, hundreds of thousands of people, mostly correctional staff, cycle in and out of these places every day, guaranteeing the spread of COVID-19 beyond the facility to the larger public. With 2.3 million people in the United States in prison or jail on any given day, an outbreak in these facilities poses a threat to the entire country. Public officials have DAYS, not weeks, to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Releasing as many people as possible from cages and stopping the flow of people into them is the best way to do it. That is why Color Of Change came together with over 60 organizations representing directly impacted people, advocates, and legal experts to develop a platform that outlines several ways public and private actors can save lives before it’s too late. We need your help to apply pressure and force officials to take a proactive approach. Friend, will you sign onto the platform? Sign the platform: Humanity, not cages, is what will get us through the Coronavirus outbreak. The worst place for anyone to be during a global pandemic is inside of a jail, prison, or detention center. Before an outbreak occurs, as many people as possible need to be released from prisons, jails, and detention centers. People who test positive for COVID-19 should be immediately released to a medical care facility, away from the rest of the incarcerated population--not held within the prison, jail, or detention center. The people who remain confined need access to adequate medical care and prevention supplies free of charge, to be able to contact their loved ones. Disregard for the humanity of incarcerated people, not common sense, is driving officials to prioritize punishment over the country’s well being. In response to this crisis, many officials are putting facilities on lockdown, sending sick individuals to solitary confinement and trying to quarantine folks inside jails. * In Delaware County, PA, a prison employee recently tested positive for COVID-19.4 As a result, public officials quarantined 34 people suspected of coming in contact with the individual within the jail. They have no plans to release people into medical care facilities and are risking the spread of the disease within the facility. * Washington State Department of Corrections has been quarantining folks ever since a correctional officer tested positive for the virus. Administrators have not taken any steps to create or tighten protocols that will keep facilities clean and safe. In fact, incarcerated folks were instructed to use old dirty socks to cover phone receivers when calling their loved ones as they scrambled to get to phones during their only 30-minute break outside the prison cell.5 This is how the disease spreads. * Officials are also putting barriers to due process that will keep people in jails longer. In several states across the country including Georgia and Louisiana, legal visits have been suspended indefinitely. If an attorney cannot meet with a client, then their case will inevitably slow down and violate that person's constitutional rights. More recently, the Prince George’s County courthouse announced that only limited bail review will be held until mid-April. A person waiting to have their bond reviewed will languish in a jail cell for at least one month, far beyond what would be allowed under typical circumstances. It does not have to be this way. Some officials are starting to respond to the demands of the people and are taking action to not only protect our public health but to protect the fundamental rights of those incarcerated as well. Los Angeles’ Sheriff announced they have already released 600 people from the county jail and officials in Cleveland plan to release hundreds of people awaiting trial as a way to combat the virus. In Philadelphia, the police department has been instructed to stop arrests of low-level offenses to slow the flow of people into jails. These are all small steps in the right direction.6,7 Right now, we have the opportunity to come together and force public officials from local municipalities all the way to the federal government to understand the urgency of the moment and make immediate changes to better respond to this emergency. Demand federal, state and local officials protect incarcerated people from a COVID-19 outbreak. Friend, all of this brings back the painful memory of the humanitarian crisis that started Color Of Change. In the midst of Hurricane Katrina in 2006, thousands of Black people were left to fend for themselves and in the process, criminalized just for trying to survive. Incarcerated people suffered as the floodwaters surrounded them. And the healthcare system collapsed, forcing medical professionals to make the unbelievable choice between who lived and who died. At that time, we saw clearly who the state deemed worthy of protection and who the state considered disposable. Here we are again. In 2020, government officials are presenting us with another false choice. We have an obligation to steer the course of history in a different direction. It is in these moments that we clearly see why we must keep working towards a future without mass incarceration. Incarcerated people deserve our care, dignity, and respect. They are our sisters, brothers, mothers, and fathers. And we reject any hard line that separates us from our loved ones inside cages. We are one community. We will push and work hard every single day towards a world where our collective impulse is not to punish but to support and protect each other. No human being should be condemned to preventable illness and possible death. If there was ever a time that clearly makes plain the injustice of putting humans in cages, it is now. Take action: I will not leave any of my people behind. My community needs a just and humane response to the coronavirus outbreak NOW.

Tell your Senators to protect wildlife from speculative leasing. The National Wildlife Federation Action Fund TAKE ACTION Elk pronghorn mule deer Alex, When you think of the American West, you’re likely to conjure up images of mule deer migrating to mountain areas in summer, pronghorn racing across vast open stretches of terrain, and Rocky Mountain elk bugling in the fall to attract mates. Unfortunately, much of this wildlife habitat is under threat from oil and gas speculators who pay rock-bottom prices to lease land that doesn’t even contain oil or gas. This is not only a bad deal for the American taxpayer, it prevents the land from being managed for conservation, wildlife, and recreation. It’s a lose-lose situation for everyone. Tell your senator to stand up for wildlife and support legislation to ban oil and gas leasing on low potential lands. TAKE ACTION Fortunately, a bill has been introduced in Congress to bring common sense reforms to the management of lands that have virtually no potential for energy development. It would simply require the government to assess the potential for mineral or energy development before lands are leased and would prohibit leases on lands that have low or no development potential. Tell your senators to support this long-overdue legislation which would stop speculative oil and gas leasing in areas with little or no potential for oil and gas. Rocky Mountain elk, pronghorn, and mule deer are symbols of the proud spirit of the American West. But oil and gas speculators threaten to undermine their habitat by snatching up public lands with leases for lands that have no potential for energy development. Will you join me and take action? Your senators can protect wildlife habitat by putting an end to leasing public lands that have low or no potential for energy development. Leasing public land that has no oil and gas potential to energy speculators is like leasing grassland prairies to timber companies or desert valleys to commercial fishermen. It simply makes no sense. Please, take a moment and take action today to stop this egregious practice. Thank you for all you do for wildlife and the lands and waters they call home.

Friend, Plan to join No Labels Thursday, April 9th at 9:00 PM ET via Zoom for a conversation with Problem Solver Caucus Member Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01) on how the COVID-19 crisis has exposed America’s manufacturing vulnerabilities and what we can do about it. Earlier this month, Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01), along with other members of the Problem Solvers Caucus introduced the Made in America Emergency Preparedness Act. This legislation focuses on ensuring our nation is taking the necessary steps to mitigate the impacts of future national emergencies, improve responsiveness, and save lives. To accomplish this, the legislation authorizes the creation of a National Commission on United States Preparedness for National Emergencies. This Commission would be modeled on the 9/11 Commission and would look at the national emergency response by the United States government and private sector to this pandemic. Thursday’s Member Briefing is a part of No Labels response to the COVID-19 crisis and our continuing commitment to unify our nation around the politics of problem solving – not protest. We host a Member Briefing daily that connects our network directly with national leaders on health care, the economy, and 21st century democracy. Join us and see for yourself that there is common sense alive and well in Washington. Holly Page Senior Advisor JOIN OUR CALL!

Salsa >>>Can you donate $25 today to help us reach our goal of $20,000 by Tuesday at 11:59 PM ET?<<< Dear Friend, As this month closes, I just wanted to share a personal perspective on why No Labels’ work is so vitally important. And to ask for your support to help us meet the crucial end of quarter fundraising deadline we have in just 3 days. We need to raise $20,000 by Tuesday at 11:59 PM ET to reach our goal. At No Labels, we have always believed the vast majority of Americans want our elected leaders to work together across party lines. But they too often simply refuse to do it. Although Congress was able to come together at the outset of the COVID pandemic to pass critical bipartisan relief legislation, we are now once again seeing the return of the same mindless and frankly dangerous tribal political behavior from our leaders. Although there is a growing national consensus that Congress should pass common sense policing reforms, congressional leaders are just playing politics. Senate Republicans developed their own bill with little input from Democrats. House Democrats developed their bill with little input from Republicans. Now, the whole reform effort is at a standstill. Although state and local governments harmed by COVID-19 are on the cusp of having to lay off firefighters, police, nurses and other essential workers, congressional leaders simply aren’t pushing the next coronavirus relief bill forward with the urgency this moment demands. At No Labels we are working so hard each and every day to push our leaders to put country over party and to solve these problems. And what keeps us going is that we see a growing group of House Problem Solvers and their bipartisan Senate allies joining this fight and doing everything they can to forge bipartisan solutions. Would you consider chipping in to help No Labels meet our end of month fundraising deadline? No Labels has so much work to do – to organize citizens, to get out our message, to bring together our members of Congress – but we can only do that work with the help of people like you. I know this is a scary and frustrating moment, but we are seeing such a growing commitment from the House Problem Solvers and from a growing bipartisan group in the Senate to challenge the status quo and to get things done for us. We have the momentum. And I hope we can count on your donation to keep the momentum going. DONATE Sincerely, Nancy Jacobson CEO and Founder No Labels | 202-588-1990 | [[URL REDACTED]] Follow us!

(But while we're at it, you're also paying-off the feds to make monkeys, fish, mountain lions, puppies, and, well, just about every other lab critter run on treadmills). Taxpayer, you're a taxpayer. You have a RIGHT (and responsibility!) to know who's paying the bills... and who's cashing the checks. So on your behalf, we campaigned for a critical NEW oversight panel and a public website reporting how the COVID-19 stimulus funds are being spent. VICTORY: thanks 100% to your donations and support, we won! The legislation includes both of WCW's common sense, government accountability measures. And Taxpayer, I have some more GOOD NEWS... Because thousands of taxpayers like you stepped up, we not only met our end-of-quarter fundraising goal... we slightly exceeded it! Now WCW can continue running (and winning!) more hard-hitting campaigns to close NIH's primate Fear Factory, and cut funding for China's wet markets and animal experiments. NEXT UP: let's put the FINAL NAIL in the coffin of taxpayer-funded treadmill torture at the Dept. of Veterans Affairs! Thanks, Taxpayer. I'm so grateful for your loyalty. We won't let you down.

So check out this new op-ed from WCW's Justin Goodman and FreedomWork's Jason Pye. See how we're cleaning up the waste... one government lab at a time. LEARN MORE » * * * Watch for Waste in Stimulus Spending JUSTIN GOODMAN & JASON PYE | March 24, 2020 The Trump Administration and Congress are hashing out a stimulus package expected to cost taxpayers over $2 trillion to combat the devastating effects of the coronavirus outbreak on workers, businesses, and the economy. American families are hurting and Congress has a responsibility to consider targeted measures that help those who are feeling the economic effects of this pandemic. However, even in times of crisis, systems for transparency and accountability are needed to ensure these precious public dollars are not wasted. With the pork stuffed into some of the COVID-19 stimulus proposals—like Democrats' plan to bail out the U.S. Postal Service's debt, reform small newspapers' pension programs, and give a $35 million payout to D.C.'s John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts—we need to be vigilant to ensure this stimulus doesn't turn into a slush fund as others have. A decade ago, President Barack Obama enacted an $862 billion stimulus package to reverse the Great Recession that followed the financial crisis. The program fell short of its lofty job creation, infrastructure, and growth goals, in part because too much stimulus money was spent on irrelevant and inefficient programs. Many people have heard about the $535 million in stimulus money wasted when failed solar panel company Solyndra went under, but waste, fraud, and abuse under the previous stimulus program were widespread. In 2010, a year after the stimulus was passed, former Senators Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) released their now-legendary report, “Summertime Blues: 100 stimulus projects that give taxpayers the blues.” The report highlighted Obama stimulus projects that the Senators said had “questionable goals,” were “being mismanaged or were poorly planned” and were even “costing jobs and hurting small businesses.” One infamous example from the stimulus report that attracted the ire of fiscal hawks and animal-lovers was a $144,541 National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded experiment that hooked monkeys on cocaine. Coburn and McCain wrote, “Researchers at Wake Forest University think that, in at least one case, it is good to monkey around with your stimulus dollars.” Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) later uncovered a study that used $560,000 in Obama stimulus money from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to put fish on treadmills. Surely, this is not how Americans intended for this stimulus money to be spent, and the opportunity still exists for this abuse of taxpayers under the guise of a national emergency. Earlier this month, Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) lambasted an NSF-funded study that wasted over $900,000 to place dead turtles and living turtles on a treadmill to study how they move. White Coat Waste Project recently exposed that the NIH shipped over $6 million in tax dollars to a U.K. university to addict monkeys to cocaine, heroin, and alcohol and wasted more than $16 million scaring monkeys with fake snakes and spiders. Wasteful junkie monkey experiments and treadmill tests are alive and well, and we can't let government bureaucrats and special interests exploit a tragedy again to funnel vulnerable taxpayers' money to their pet projects. Something the Obama Administration's stimulus bill got right was assigning an independent body to oversee stimulus projects and launching [[URL REDACTED]] to track spending and report abuse. For each project, the now-defunct government website reported how much money was spent, the number of jobs created, and other details. Any stimulus bills that make it to the president's desk should include a mechanism for independent oversight of spending and mandate a transparent and user-friendly system allowing taxpayers and lawmakers to hold government accountable for where stimulus money is going and what impact it has on the economy. Americans are rightfully worried about the health of their friends, families, and 401Ks. We are, too. People shouldn't also have to worry that federal emergency funds meant to save lives and livelihoods are being wasted to put fish on treadmills or renovate an opera house.

And nearly half of them have also lost the health insurance they got through their employer, according to the Economic Policy Institute. The middle of a deadly pandemic is NOT the time to be without health insurance and access to affordable medical care. An easy solution is staring us in the face.

Sign our petition to demand the Trump Administration open up the federal marketplace and takes action to ensure that all 50 states re-open their ACA marketplaces. So far, the Trump Administration has put ideology ahead of common sense, and refused to open the exchanges. 11 states and the District of Columbia did it on their own, allowing people to apply for coverage right away.

So far, the Trump Administration has put ideology ahead of common sense, and refused to open the exchanges. 11 states and the District of Columbia did it on their own, allowing people to apply for coverage right away. But that leaves millions with no coverage -- and no access to affordable coverage. Please sign today. Thank you for all you do.

# Giffords Friends, Joe Biden just announced his pick for Vice President and we are so thrilled to have Senator Kamala Harris join the fight to defeat Trump in November. Like Joe Biden, Kamala Harris is a gun safety champion with a proven record of fighting the NRA and standing up for common sense. They will work tirelessly together to pass universal background checks and make every community safer from gun violence. We can’t think of a better pair to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump and the NRA in November — and win! But they’re going to need our help to win this race, which is why we’re hoping we can raise $10,000 tonight to help fuel our efforts to defeat the NRA’s #1 ally, Donald Trump. What do you say? Will you chip in $3 to help us elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? Together we can stand up to the gun lobby and elect two leaders who will make gun safety a priority. If you've stored your info with ActBlue, we'll process your contribution instantly: Donate $10 Donate $25 Donate $50 Donate $100 Donate $250 Other amount Kamala Harris made history today by becoming the first woman of color to be on a presidential ticket. And she and Joe Biden will make history again when they celebrate the passage of lifesaving background checks legislation in 2021. But there’s less than 100 days left until Election Day and it’s going to take a team effort to win this race. So let’s dig in and fight hard. Joe and Kamala need us with them.

# Giffords Friends - Today marks seven years since tragedy struck Sandy Hook Elementary School. For the families of Newtown, we know the pain will never go away. In the aftermath of this horror, politician after politician vowed to honor those who were killed. They said they would make our communities safer from gun violence. That no other families should have to experience what the families of Newtown did. Yet today, seven years later, Congress has done something remarkable: nothing. Congress remains in the gun lobby's grip. They have refused to act to make communities safer. Yet for all this dysfunction and obstruction, Americans are still calling for common sense solutions. The fight to reduce gun violence goes on. And we will never forget Sandy Hook. I will not rest until we have righted this wrong and changed our laws to make our communities safer, or changed our Congress for a different one that puts our interests ahead of the gun lobby's. So before the end of the year, please make a $3 contribution to ensure we have the resources to fight back against the gun lobby that has consistently used big money and influence to obstruct our progress. Our democracy's history is peppered with names we neither remember nor celebrate — people who stood in the way of progress while protecting the powerful. To do nothing while others suffer is not the American way. Thank you for standing with me. Gabby Giffords * * * This email was sent to [[EMAIL_REDACTED]].

Happy end of the year and end of the decade! And what a year it has been. View in Browser Thank you for a successful 2019 Dear Alex Happy end of the year and end of the decade! What a year. The relaunch of ConservAmerica has been a great success thanks to your support. The View in Browser ## Thank you for a successful 2019 Dear Alex Happy end of the year and end of the decade! What a year. The relaunch of ConservAmerica has been a great success thanks to your support. The end of the year is always a busy time, but we wanted to take a moment and let you know about some of the highlights from the past 12 months. Probably the biggest news of the year was the launch of the Roosevelt Conservation Caucus. We were proud to support Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Cory Gardner of Colorado, and Reps. Elise Stefanik of New York and Brian Mast of Florida in their efforts to set up the bicameral Republican caucus and recruit members. The caucus continues to attract conservative members of Congress who support proactive, constructive efforts to meet our environmental challenges and conservation goals, including making sure our public places are well cared for and remain open for everyone to enjoy. Along with our sister organization, the Roosevelt Conservation Foundation (RCF), we hosted a number of lunch briefings for congressional staff during the past year on the various legislative priorities of caucus members. Those priorities range from protecting at-risk species on private working lands to addressing the maintenance backlog at our national parks, cleaning up abandoned mines, and promoting advanced energy solutions to reduce emissions. Our last briefing of the year focused on market-oriented land management strategies in the agriculture and forestry sectors to meet conservation and environmental challenges. We’re looking forward to the new year and a whole new crop of legislative briefings. Be sure to check in with us regularly to find out what RCC members are doing to promote commonsense solutions to our conservation priorities and environmental challenges. Revamped the ConservAmerica newsletter. If you’re reading this, it means you’re on our newsletter list! Have friends who love the outdoors and our public spaces but are frustrated by the lack of market-based solutions to environmental problems? Send them our way. Revamped the ConservAmerica newsletter. If you’re reading this, it means you’re on our newsletter list! Have friends who love the outdoors and our public spaces but are frustrated by the lack of market-based solutions to environmental problems? Send them our way. We also added some new faces to our leadership team. We’re still small and scrappy, but punching above our weight and committed to growing in order to better serve our mission of promoting conservative values and protecting clean air and clean water. Jeff Kupfer, a former chief of staff and acting deputy secretary at the U.S. Department of Energy, took over as president of ConservAmerica when former president, Rob Sisson, was confirmed by the Senate to the International Joint Commission. Brent Fewell, Robert Dillon, and Todd Johnston round out the team. We also brought on some new executive board members and we created an advisory board of experts from across the country. One of our favorite nights of the past year was our annual gala and awards dinner on November 15. We were honored to present our Congressional Champion Award to Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado for their continued commitment to conservation. We were overwhelmed with the response to the dinner and owe a great debt of gratitude to all who came out and made the night a smashing success. Thank you. We launched a new website and updated our policy goals. An organization’s website is its calling card, and we decided ours needed an update. We’re not done (websites are never truly finished) but we hope you like our new calling card. We’ve done our best to lay out what we believe and why we believe it. We saw a need for a place for people who love the outdoors and want to make sure future generations have the same chance to enjoy it as they do, but who may not think of themselves as environmentalists — if you’re like us, taking care of what you’ve got is just common sense. Our overarching goal as an organization is to help build common ground between policymakers and stakeholders around policies that protect the environment and economic growth. Our priorities are environmental stewardship, conservation, improving access to public lands, and supporting policies to make the energy we depend on cleaner, reliable, and affordable. When we’re not on Capitol Hill, we’re out hunting, fishing, hiking, skiing, bird watching, playing — enjoying this Great Land. We want to make sure our children and grandchildren have the same opportunities, and that’s why we are ConservAmerica. We hope you join us. facebook twitter instagram ConservAmerica, 1455 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Suite 400, Washington DC, United States Unsubscribe

People living with mental illness often face community stigma over their illnesses and can be excluded from community activities and employment opportunities for the same reason. Dana will lead by example in helping promote and show publicly his support of anti-stigma campaigns created by MDHHS and the CMH system. This will affirm the rights of people with mental illnesses to be included in their community, and work to create workplace integration and vocational training programs. Alex Brown, One in five Americans live with mental illness. It's you, someone in your family, a loved-one, or a friend. Attention to mental health is just as important as physical health. It's preventative medicine, because when untreated and in crisis, the results are life-threatening. #EndTheStigma It's my priority to create a healthy and inclusive society where the needs of people with mental illnesses are met and their daily lives are fulfilling and self-determined. I hope my commitment will make our communities stronger, safer, and healthier for all. Mental illness affects the daily lives of one in five Americans. Their health, safety, and community inclusion are a priority. We must affirm that the civil rights of people with mental illness will be upheld and that issues of Mental Health policy, funding and legislation will receive full attention and support. To improve treatment options and quality of life for people living with mental illness in the district, I will adopt these vital and common sense policies on mental health and treatment issues: * Funding for Community Mental Health (CMH) * Resist Privatization of Medicaid Services * Crisis Intervention Training * Income Disparities * Ending the Stigma For details on these priorities visit [[URL REDACTED]] Can I count on you to support our policy-driven campaign by making a contribution today?

When someone is sick, they shouldn’t be forced to choose between losing wages or getting other people sick. That’s common sense. # Ro Khanna When someone is sick, they shouldn’t be forced to choose between losing wages or getting other people sick. That’s common sense. But because this Administration has refused to fight for working-people, millions of our neighbors are forced to make exactly that choice in the middle of a coronavirus outbreak. This crisis was containable. But we did not take the policy steps or precautions necessary to do that. That’s a mistake that our current leadership must learn from. Here’s our first step: Pass Universal Paid Sick Leave. Sign your name to demand that our leaders deliver that promise to working families right now. Sign your name If we can afford a massive tax break for corporations and billionaires, then we can afford to make sure working-families can take time off of work to get better.

Team, With only 74 days left until the general election, we can’t waste another second. Josh is working every day to ensure the residents of NJ-5 have a strong voice in Congress. This year, NJ-5 has two choices: either we re-elect Josh — a family-focused problem solver who stands up for our values — or we’re stuck with “Fraudster Frank” Pallotta, a man who made his fortune preying on families in our community. It’s go time. Josh is fighting for us every day on the House floor, and he needs our help. We need to raise $5,000 by the end of this weekend to make sure our campaign has the resources to take on “Fraudster Frank”. Can you chip in?

In 2016, Josh won this seat from an ineffective politician for us. If we want to keep our representative working for us, we can’t be complacent. Josh is the fighter we need. He’s willing to work across the aisle and create common sense solutions. His leadership is what we need in Washington, not politicians using ideological differences as an excuse for lack of progress.

Roy Cooper for North Carolina Hey everyone, I want to give you an update on the new COVID-19 Coronavirus in North Carolina. North Carolina has new coronavirus cases in multiple counties and regions. Our Task Force, state officials, and experts are working around the clock to respond to this virus. The health and safety of people in North Carolina is my top priority. North Carolina has not yet seen the widespread infection some other states have experienced but our actions together now can help limit the spread in our state. Here are common sense precautions you and your loved ones can take: * Wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds at a time. * Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. * Avoid close contact with people who are ill. * Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. * Do not reuse tissue after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose. * Clean and disinfect surfaces that are frequently touched. * Be vigilant in monitoring your health and stay home if you’re sick. During this time, we must stay informed. For updates, please visit the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services website here. This is a tough time for our state, our country, and the world. But we as North Carolinians know: we are better when we work together.

Friends: Yesterday, Pitt County and Eastern North Carolina suffered a devastating loss with the announcement from Vidant Health that close to 200 people are losing their jobs. Access to healthcare and the stability of employment within it should not be a political issue, but the GOP-led General Assembly and legislators like appointed Representative Perrin Jones (my opponent in November), are refusing to take action toward common sense measures that would inject critical resources into rural health systems across the East. Now, people and communities are suffering. Instead of expanding Medicaid to immediately cover over 13,000 citizens* and create over 500 new healthcare jobs in Pitt County, state legislators leave rural hospitals like Vidant to fend for themselves. After seeing other states in both Democratic and Republican-leaning areas successfully expand Medicaid on behalf of their communities, voting yes to expansion should be one of the easiest policy decisions North Carolina lawmakers can make. Creating a means for expanded access to health care would: 1) help our families, friends, and neighbors get the healthcare they need without breaking the bank; 2) keep people employed in the healthcare industry; and 3) alleviate some of the significant financial strain placed on our rural hospitals. Expanding Medicaid is one of the common sense priorities I will support in the North Carolina State House and I will work with anyone – Democrat, Republican, or Unaffiliated – who is serious about making the smart investments we need to improve access to affordable healthcare for all, keep healthcare workers employed, and help rural hospitals stay open.

Friends: Yesterday, health employees on the front lines of COVID-19 in Greenville and Eastern North Carolina got more devastating news regarding their jobs, salaries, and retirement with the announcement of furloughs and other extreme cost-saving measures at Vidant. CEO Michael Waldrum said the changes hoisted upon Vidant by COVID-19 compounded financial challenges posed by serving a large population of poor and uninsured patients, which could have been addressed by Medicaid Expansion.* This is the second time in two months that Vidant has been forced to make major personnel decisions. Back in early March, close to 200 people were terminated due to revenue shortfalls. Our rural healthcare system is teetering on the edge during one of the most challenging crisis in modern memory due in large part to the shortsightedness of the GOP-led General Assembly, including my opponent, appointed Representative Perrin Jones. Instead of expanding Medicaid to immediately cover over 13,000 citizens, create over 500 new healthcare jobs, and inject over $114 million more into the economy of Pitt County alone,** state legislators leave rural hospitals like Vidant to fend for themselves and hard working people with no access to affordable care. They show no signs of stopping either. Earlier this week during a virtual event, House Speaker Tim Moore made it clear to the Pitt County business community (I was on the call) that anyone who can get a job should not receive help - completely ignoring the fact that 60% of people who would qualify for Medicaid Expansion are already employed and just don't make enough to purchase health insurance on their own.*** Pitt County's low-income citizens aren't "takers" looking for a handout and it's irresponsible of Speaker Moore to imply so. Many of the working poor are doing just that - working. Many are our neighbors and our friends. They include cooks, laborers, retail employees, and maintenance workers. The fact is that near poverty has left many of them uninsurable without Medicaid. After seeing other states in both Democratic and Republican-leaning areas work together to successfully expand Medicaid on behalf of their communities, voting yes to expansion should be one of the easiest policy decisions North Carolina lawmakers can make. Creating a means for expanded access to health care would: 1) help our families, friends, and neighbors get the healthcare they need without breaking the bank; 2) keep people employed in the healthcare industry; and 3) alleviate some of the significant financial strain placed on our rural hospitals. Expanding Medicaid is one of the common sense priorities I will support in the North Carolina State House and I will work hard to bring together all parties to make the smart investments we need to improve access to affordable healthcare for all, keep healthcare workers employed, and help rural hospitals like Vidant stay open.

\-- Have you seen the news? Meteorologists are currently watching Hurricane Laura, as it made landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border last night, registering as a Category 4 storm. While folks in the region aren’t unfamiliar with storms like this, this extreme weather highlights a much bigger issue: climate change. Here’s the gist: Scientists have found mounting evidence that human activity is raising the risk of some types of extreme weather -- including storms like Laura. Dana is running for Congress because Rep. Barry Loudermilk is ignoring science. Extreme weather events -- like hurricanes in the Gulf Coast or wildfires in California -- are real events that affect the lives and livelihoods of Americans across the country, and it’s time we do something about it. Will you add your name right now to stand with Dana for common sense climate solutions?

Our gun safety video chat tomorrow could not come at a more critical time. Alex -- I'm really looking forward to our gun safety video chat event tomorrow afternoon with Parkland Dad Fred Guttenberg and Moms Demand Action founder Shannon Watts. With this week's news, it could not come at a more critical time for gun violence in America. We'll be discussing where we go from here and more on tomorrow's virtual event at 2 PM EST. RSVP now to get in on the conversation » You're probably already following the Ahmaud Arbery shooting closely if you're in Georgia like many folks on this email list, but for those of you in other states, the story really started making headline news this week when an explicit video of the shooting of yet another unarmed black man was released by the national media. It brought immediate comparisons to 2012, with the killing of Travyvon Martin, and of my son Jordan Davis. Folks on a wide spectrum of political views have spoken out lamenting the killing this week. It's another inflection point, and our gun safety movement needs to be ready to act. Like in Jordan's case, we need the judicial system to do the right thing here and get justice for Ahmaud's family. But we can not let this kind of thing keep happening in America -- full stop. Unarmed black men can not keep being gunned down in their cars, at a gas station, because they wanted a bag of skittles and an Arizona iced tea, or while jogging in their neighborhood. Our kids must be able to attend school without the threat of being gunned down. So, I hope you'll join us for our gun safety video chat tomorrow at 2pm -- I'm eager to discuss how our gun safety movement goes forward from here to continue to make changes in Congress and across the country that work towards our goal of common sense solutions to end gun violence.

With just 10 days to go until Election Day, let us give you 10 reasons why you should support Adam in the final stretch to make sure we win on Nov. 3. View this email in your browser Alex, There’s A LOT at stake in this election: our health, our rights, and the literal survival of our planet and democracy . With just 10 days to go until Election Day, let us give you 10 reasons why you should support Adam in the final stretch to make sure we WIN on Nov. 3. 1\. He would be the youngest person in Congress. At age 27, Adam is the youngest Dem congressional nominee in the country. And if elected, would be the youngest sitting Congressperson. Let’s invest in the next generation of progressive changemakers. 2\. Adam will stand up for working families. Growing up in post-Recession Indianna, Adam saw firsthand how corporate greed destroyed working and middle class communities. That’s why in Congress, he’ll always stand up to special interests and fight for working people. 3\.

You don't want to miss this. DONATE HERE VOLUNTEER Trail Update Friends, This week, my team and I have been busy working remotely to check in on our local businesses, organizations, and neighbors to see how we can best help. While daily activities have changed, it is important for us to remain engaged with the people of District. We want to provide as much support to our small businesses through sharing information about their hours of operation and ways the community can support small businesses. We have also compiled resources and information for students & parents, farmers & ranchers, veterans, seniors, and small business. These resources can be found here. The toll this virus is taking and will continue to take on local economies and small businesses cannot be overstated. I know many businesses and organizations in our 6 counties have been hit hard by this virus and has led to the cancellation of many large economic drivers of local economies. Please make every reasonable attempt to support your local businesses, especially those within the service industry that are some of the hardest hit. Again, we cannot stress how important it is to remain calm, use common sense, and take basic preventative measures. Americans are resilient and I have no doubt that we will rebound quickly. Together, we will get through this. God bless, Kat Tele-Townhall In order to best practice social distancing, we launched a tele-townhall series this week. We had our first tele-townhall on Sunday to discuss COVID-19 and it's impact on our district. Team Kat was able to share the information we have and answer questions. We will be continuing to gather information about the virus, as well as response, and share it with you. Stay tuned to find out when our next tele-townhall will be. I would love for you to join us! On Social Media Thank you to our healthcare workers and industry people for fighting every day during the Coronavirus outbreak. We are so blessed to have each and every one of you on the front lines, keeping the country safe! ﻿God bless you all and your work! While we know that social distancing made celebrating the holiday a little different this year, we still wanted to wish you a Happy St. Patrick’s Day on Tuesday! Keep up with Kat on the campaign trail! Video Updates On Monday, I posted a short video from home! My team and I are working remotely to contact small businesses and other organizations to see how we can best help and support them during this time. Keep an eye on our social media pages - we'll be posting ways you can continue to help your community during this pandemic. As always, please keep our medical community and first responders in your thoughts and prayers - they need our full support as they work to protect our communities. Click here to watch the full video. On Saturday, I posted an update on the Coronavirus and it's impact in FL-03. Throughout this pandemic, we must keep a level head and not give in to panic.

Our Commitment to Keeping Missouri Families Safe Hi Alex, Did you see the news? Moms Demand has given Lindsey the Moms Demand Gun Sense Candidate Distinction. Lindsey is committed to preventing gun violence in our communities, while ensuring that we maintain responsible firearm ownership. The idea that we must choose between responsible gun ownership and the prevention of gun violence is a myth. Chip in now to help Lindsey! It is our duty to uphold the second amendment and protect our families from gun violence. There are powerful people who want us to believe holding both views simultaneously is impossible. But Lindsey was five years old when she shot her first gun--and she was 20 years old when she hid under her first desk when an armed shooter was doors away from her classroom. Lindsey understands the importance of securing family traditions and protecting students who are simply trying to learn. She believes there are common sense steps we can take to ensure firearms stay out of criminals' hands. Tomorrow, Lindsey will join Moms Demand Action of Columbia and Jefferson City to discuss common sense firearm proposals. Please join us. Thank you for all of your hard work and your support thus far. We have 75 days left. Let's keep going!

Dear Alex, As many of us celebrate Passover and Easter this week under unprecedented circumstances, it gives us a new opportunity to reflect on their teachings and lessons. These holidays remind us that people have struggled throughout our history, but because they cared for each other, they overcame monumental obstacles to persevere. Let us use this time to celebrate people rising together to overcome obstacles, and remind us of what we can do if we support and care for one another. In Congress, I’m working to ensure our communities have the support they need to weather this storm. On March 4, I voted for an $8.3 billion bill to stabilize our public health system and provide the resources our community needs to manage this public health crisis. On March 14, we built upon that work by passing the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. This bill provides direct support to working families and individuals whose lives have been upended by this disease. On March 27, I continued to build upon that work by supporting the CARES Act—a $2.2 trillion stimulus bill. This legislation adds assistance to individuals, hospitals, local governments, and employers of all sizes to ensure everyone is cared for during these trying times. If you need assistance through any of these programs please go to [[URL REDACTED]] to learn more, and if you are able to help others during this trying time please visit [[URL REDACTED]] for opportunities. Americans have proven their resiliency time and time again. With common sense and empathy, we will get through this. I urge everyone to stay safe, stay connected, and stay home. Your strength and perseverance inspire me. Patti and I are sending our best thoughts for your continued health during these trying times.

Our bill passed its first critical vote this past week! Read more about this groundbreaking legislation -- then share my post online David Chiu 2020 Logo Friends, The gun industry has been dragging its feet on a common-sense law that would make guns safer and hold criminals accountable. Together, we can force them to take action that will save lives. My new bill, AB 2847, would require gunmakers to incorporate microstamping technology -- to imprint microscopic characters that identify a handgun’s make, model, and serial number on the casing of every bullet that is fired. Having this information is critical to solving countless crimes involving firearms, as well as to reducing the black market for guns. The bill would also require that new handguns include safety features to prevent accidental shootings. \[Twitter: David Chiu\] I was excited to present our bill in Public Safety Committee today to compel the gun industry to adopt stronger safety measures. These are strong, common sense measures that will make us all safer. Background on the bill: A microstamping law was signed in 2007, but the gun manufacturers in California decided simply to stop producing any new handguns at all -- arguing that the technology was too hard to implement. My bill simplifies the microstamping requirement, in a way that the gun industry has admitted in court they can already do. With this new simpler approach, forcing the manufacturers to change their ways, I’m calling their bluff. Our bill passed its first critical vote this past week. Please click here to read the San Francisco Chronicle piece on this groundbreaking legislation -- and then share my post with your friends and family! READ NOW » It’s far past time for excuses by the gun industry. As a father, I’m ready to do all I can to ensure that all of our children are safe, and that gunmakers are held accountable. I’m honored to be working with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the Giffords Law Center, March for Our Lives California and a host of other advocates -- who believe, as I passionately do, that the gun industry has evaded this critical issue for far too long.

No images? Click here Alex, As a former prosecutor, I've spent my career working with our local law enforcement professionals to protect the public's safety. I am proud of my record and honored to be the only candidate in the race for Assembly to be endorsed by state and local law enforcement. Supporting our campaign for a safer Central Coast and California are the Santa Barbara County Deputy Sheriffs' Association, the San Luis Obispo Deputy Sheriffs' Association, the California Association of Highway Patrolmen, the California Coalition of Law Enforcement Associations, and the California Correctional Peace Officers Association. “As a legislator and former prosecutor, Jordan has always stood up for crime victims and supported policies that put the public’s safety first,” said Neil Gowing, President of the Santa Barbara County Deputy Sheriffs’ Association. “As more and more extremists call for policies that defund the police and put communities at risk, we know that Jordan will be there to stand up for crime victims and be the voice of common sense.” I am a proud supporter of our Central Coast law enforcement community, and I am honored to be their choice for Assembly. Sincerely, Jordan P.S. I need your help to keep our ads running. It's critical for folks to understand that my opponent supports the largest property tax increase in state history.

While there are still votes being counted, it does not appear our campaign will be continuing on to the general election in November. Dear Alex, While there are still votes being counted, it does not appear our campaign will be continuing on to the general election in November. I called the other Democrat in the race, Scott Rhinehart, to congratulate him and offered to help in any way I can. I want to express my gratitude to all of you who supported our upstart campaign for your time, advice, and contributions. Despite our late start, we accomplished more than most thought we could; finishing third out of five, ahead of the incumbent, with over 27,000 votes! This is only the first step in my journey to bring us together around shared values and find common sense, bipartisan solutions to our most pressing issues. In these trying times, we are reminded how important it is to have leaders to hold themselves accountable and put the public’s wellbeing ahead of their own personal and political interests. Making the right decision, even at personal cost was a central tenet of our campaign. It will remain so as we work together to make our community better and in the next campaign to come. Thanks again for all your support. Chris Paid for by Chris Duncan for Assembly, FPPC #1422005. Chris Duncan for Assembly 2020 P.O. Box 3727 San Clemente, CA 92674 United States unsubscribe

7 days to vote for change! ✅ View this email in your browser # We're just a week away and I want your vote! Dear Friends, We are 7 days from the primary election. Have you voted yet? Every day I see more reasons why this election matters. Take SB 1079, a bill introduced this month that would strip property owners of their resale rights. If you have a property that stays vacant for 90 days, Sacramento would like a closer look. Before you can list that property, you have to let government-backed trusts have first call, and, get this, the government itself can swoop in with eminent domain. Don't believe me? Read the text of Sen. Skinner's proposed bill for yourself. I have hope that we can bring some common sense, some balance, and accountability back to Sacramento but I need your help!! Thank you for sending in messages, for sending in your ballots, for telling your friends about why this election is so important! From the homeless situation to education, affordability to taxes, let's take back Senate District 17 and change the direction our state is headed.

My husband Knowa is running for Athens-Clarke District 10 Commission! Dear supporters, I hope you and your family are doing well and staying safe. While Governor Kemp has ignored the advice of most public health experts and has begun to reopen Georgia, I hope you'll continue to stay safe and practice common sense. We are six weeks away from the June 9th election! I'm on the ballot as the Democratic Candidate for House District 117 and my husband Knowa is running for Athens-Clarke District 10 Commissioner. From now through June 9th, we need your help. By pitching in a few dollars to helping make phone calls, everything helps. To support Knowa's campaign, sign up to volunteer or donate here. To learn more about Knowa's platform for a better Athens, go to his website. In order to fight for the change we want to see, we must fight for change on a local level and a state level. Knowa and I are not your average politicians, but we are both running to continue fighting for our community and making sure we're not taken for granted. Running for public office during a pandemic is challenging and mentally taxing. My team and I are continuing to run a strong campaign, even as many of us are struggling financially or trying to keep our children and family safe and healthy. While it is definitely a difficult task, this crisis has made it clear why I'm in this fight. At a time when so many of us were already living paycheck to paycheck and without healthcare, we must fight for big, structural change. From Medicaid expansion to major voting reform, I promise to fight for working class families to make sure our voices are heard. Bold Progress and Fearless Leadership, Mokah DONATE NOW ### Phone Banking Party TOMORROW at 3PM! This Tuesday, we will be hosting a volunteer phone banking party. This will be an opportunity for us to do phone calls for Mokah and Knowa, while getting to know the other volunteers! How will this work? Those interested in joining will be sent a Zoom invite to join a meeting room with other volunteers and staff. Once we spend some time getting to know each other, we'll all do phone calls together, using the Zoom conference as an opportunity to take breaks and ask any questions as they arise. Feel free to join for as little or as long as you want! This is an opportunity purely to make phone banking more fun and have an opportunity to see other faces as we continue to shelter-in-place! RSVP by signing up on [[URL REDACTED]] ### Volunteer with Us! Even if you can't make it to the phone banking party, we'd still love your help! As we continue to social distance, we still need to reach people by calling them and letting them know about our campaign. We will also be checking up on individuals, making sure they are okay, and making sure people know to request their absentee ballots for the June 9th election. VOLUNTEER SIGN UP ### Want to get involved? As Mokah continue down this path, we are going to need everyone to pitch in and help us fight for the change we want to see. Can we count on you to help out? * Sign up to volunteer and phone bank! * Donate to the campaign * Host a fundraiser in the future * Follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram Let's fight for the change we want to see in our community. @MokahforGeorgia Mokah for Georgia Mokah for Georgia Mokah for Georgia Email Copyright © 2019 Mokah for Georgia, All rights reserved.

A Lt. Gov. nominee who stands up for center-right values and finds forward-looking solutions for our concerns. # What's at Stake on Aug 11? As I said in my closing statement at the VPR-VT PBS debate last week, in response to Scott's condescending statement (which he repeats below) -- Standing up for our right-of-center values and convictions does not amount to shoving political agendas down people's throats. Having no social or political philosophy that guides your understanding of policy-making is not a virtue. Classical Liberalism and American Conservatism inform my engagement with our politics. I reject Marxism and the other schools of thought on which Extreme Left policies and positions are founded. His statement below implies that right-of-center positions are not based in fact and are impractical. This is what the Extreme Left says about us all the time. 76% of the Chittenden County electorate regularly votes, while only 42% outside Chittenden County does so. His statement tells us why. When you can't tell the difference between the D/P and R nominees, what's the point of voting! ## Meg's Positions on Key Issues & Proposed Solutions 1\. How Should We Manage the COVID Crisis Now? Now that we have months of scientific data about the novel coronavirus, we should tailor our policies accordingly. I explain why continuing with a one-size-fits-all approach is unwise. 2\. Cut the Bureaucracy & Open Up VT's Economy In this clip, I explain why there is absolutely no need to raise taxes on Vermonters. 3\. Deregulate to Create Upwardly Mobile Jobs Vermont's economy is structurally weak, burdened by mountains of red tape, bureaucracy, and draconian regulations. This is why I support deregulation and comprehensive tax reform to boost economic development. 4\. Combating Climate Alarmism My position on VT's various legislative proposals that are informed by climate alarmism and unfounded claims of impending catastrophe. 5\. We Must Protect the Integrity of Our Elections A recent poll shows 85% of Vermonters oppose mass mail-in voting. Yet, it will be implemented for the general election this November. We all want every living American citizen to vote once. Mailing ballots to everyone on Voter Lists -- that aren't properly updated -- creates opportunity for bad actors to manipulate the voting process. This is common sense. There will be no added measures to protect election integrity -- no Voter ID/ citizenship verification/ signature verification. We should be concerned that 100,000+ unclaimed ballots will be floating around. The Extreme Left claims that opposition to mass mail-in voting = voter suppression. We DO NOT need a Republican candidate who parrots this falsehood. Republican primary voters want a Lt. Governor nominee who stands up for our core values and convictions, and who helps find solutions to our legitimate concerns. Click This Button to Donate! ## A Vote for Meg Hansen is a Vote for Middle Class Families & Workers I will serve as an ally and advocate for middle class families and workers, the tens of thousands of Vermonters who feel their needs and interests are unheard and not represented by VT's permanent political class. Ask your friends and family to like and follow our Facebook Page to receive regular updates and stay connected with the campaign. Many thanks once again to Rep. Mark Higley and 15 current and former legislators for generously endorsing my candidacy. Rep. Steve Adams, Rep. Robert Bancroft, Rep. Lynn Batchelor, Rep. Larry Fiske, Rep. Douglas Gage, Rep. Marianna Gamache, Rep. Robert Helm, Rep. Ronald E. Hubert, Rep. Gary Nolan, Rep. Albert Pearce, Rep. Brian Smith, Rep. Victoria Strong, Rep. Job Tate, Rep. Gary Viens, and Rep. Janssen Willhoit.

Dear Director Frakes,The topic of failing prisons in Nebraska has come up a lot recently. During my conversations with hundreds of neighbors and fri Janet Palmtag for Legislature Dear Director Frakes, The topic of failing prisons in Nebraska has come up a lot recently. During my conversations with hundreds of neighbors and friends throughout southeast Nebraska, serious problems in our prisons have been mentioned over and over again. As you know, the prison in Tecumseh is an important economic driver for Johnson County, as well as the surrounding areas. I certainly don’t need to tell you that overcrowded inmates, staff shortages and retention problems are decimating our overburdened prison workforce. In the midst of these issues, you’ve accepted a raise from Governor Ricketts that equates to more money than many hardworking Nebraskans will earn in a year. I know your job is difficult. I know you navigate many complex problems daily. But the fact remains: Our prison system is broken. In fact, it’s so broken that we have entered a mandatory state of emergency. Nebraskans continue to lose their jobs to COVID-19, struggle to pay for out-of-control property tax rates and cover the rising cost of living. Nebraskans are nice. But they’re also hardworking, practical people with common sense. Please consider returning your $58,000 raise to Nebraska taxpayers.

I have a number of people in the legislature with their finger on the pulse! Please watch and share, and tell your friends to bring any questions they may have. You can watch last night's update here. ﻿ Follow @BostforNC on Facebook & Instagram for daily updates. Special Request I want to start out today asking you to keep the family of Kerry Peeler in your hearts. She lost her battle with COVID-19 today. She leaves a family, our community and many people who loved her behind. I know we have lost too many in our community already, but she was my friend. These numbers get numbing to read and to hear, but they are each attached to a person who is loved and missed terribly. COVID-19 Local Update We had 41 new cases reported today for a total of 1,656 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Catawba County. We have 24 people hospitalized and we have unfortunately had another death reported today. This brings us to 21 deaths in the county, 7 of which our community has suffered in the last week. The news here for us to realize is we are running at an 11.5% positive testing rate in Catawba County. The state has been around 8% for the last week. We are substantially higher than the statewide level. Catawba County Public Health Director Jennifer McCracken said earlier this week that they are very concerned about the trajectory this disease is taking in Catawba County. She confirmed there is rapid community spread happening, and it is not just in congregate care facilities. According to a report done by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit newsroom based in Washington, D.C, Catawba County was recently listed in the top areas of COVID-19 concern -- “red zones” -- in North Carolina. It labeled red zones as areas with more than 100 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 in population as well as higher than 10 percent of coronavirus tests returning positive. We are over 11%. The report was prepared for the White House Coronavirus Task Force but was not publicized. Statewide 106,893 people have tested positive for the coronavirus. 1,188 hospitalized with 94% hospitals reporting. 1,726 COVID-19 deaths. The big frustration statewide right now is a backlog in testing. Results are taking a week to 10 days to come back. Commercial labs are backlogged. Hospital labs don’t have the reagents, or chemicals, they need for testing, Secretary Cohen said yesterday there is a lack of a coordinated federal strategy in resolving supply chain problems is contributing to the testing backlog. The state is trying to pair testing collection sites with labs that have capacity. There’s a work group looking at ways to improve turnaround times, she said, but federal leadership and an overall federal strategy are needed. Cooper's Message About Face Masks Gov. Roy Cooper again stressed the importance of wearing face masks in public spaces during a press conference on Tuesday, with strong words for those who have “refused” to do so. “For those who continue to defy basic decency and common sense because they refuse to wear a mask — either wear one or don’t go in the store,” Cooper said. “The refusal to wear a mask is selfish. It infringes on the life and liberty of everyone else in the store.” “Not only is wearing a mask the decent, neighborly thing to do, it’s the best way to boost our economy,” he said. Governor Cooper also said 900,000 masks, hand sanitizer and cloth face coverings are being sent this week to Cooperative Extension Service county centers across the state for distribution to farms and agricultural operations. Some of these supplies have been difficult for farmers to source as demand has exceeded supply, Many Latino residents are employed as farmworkers or in meat processing plants, where they work and often live in close proximity to others. While Latino residents are less than 10% of the state’s population. they represent more than 43% of people who have tested positive for the coronavirus. Stress During a Pandemic The constant stress of living in the age of coronavirus is affecting more than your mental health and emotional coping abilities. It's likely taking a toll on your body as well, according to an article in Contentment Magazine (produced by the American Institute of Stress). “We're living in a sea of stress hormones every day," said stress management expert Dr. Cynthia Ackrill. ”We're not designed for a constant application of these chemicals. The stress hormone cortisol just ravages our bodies when it's dumped into our system repeatedly." ﻿ Some suggestions to ease this affect and maintain health in your body: ﻿ * Exercise * Stay connected to family and friends * Mindfulness - meditation and yoga * Smile, laugh! * Spend time in nature Catawba County Schools This Fall The 3 school systems in Catawba County have all come out with their plans for this year.

Thank you for helping me reach our mid-year campaign goal. This will be a hard fight, not just for New Hanover County, but for our State. View this email in your browser # THANK YOU. Thank you to all those who stepped up to the plate and helped me meet our mid-year goal, I sincerely appreciate your support! While this is an important milestone in the Lee for NC campaign, there is much work to be done. Our campaign is not just for New Hanover County, though -- this is for our State. Over the next few months, you will hear a lot about my opponent, Harper Peterson. Some of what you hear will seem hard to believe -- like voting against teacher raises for the entire state -- but it's true. Why would he do something like? Why would he defy common sense and the common good? Why would he vote against teacher pay raises? Because time and time again, Harper prioritized political games over people's needs. By way of just one example, Harper was the deciding vote AGAINST teacher raises and much needed funding for our area. He voted NO, and New Hanover County LOST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. Every penny of our taxes that would have come back to our community -- simply, gone. (See the sidebar, or see below on mobile, for details.) I know. Hard to believe, but it is true. If he had voted YES, all of the those items and more would have been funded last year. These are just a few examples. Unfortunately, there are many more. Like I said, this is not just about New Hanover County -- this is about all of us. We quite literally cannot afford two more years of Harper Peterson. Harper cost us millions because he was the deciding vote against: $16.8 million to New Hanover County Schools for school construction and repairs $10 million to Cape Fear Community College for construction and repairs $3.2 million to County schools to support the expansion of one of the only Technical High Schools in the state - SEA TECH $250,000 to the County for treatment for alcohol and opioid dependence as a part of reentry treatment programs in county jails $1 million to the City of Wilmington for a disaster hardening project $250,000 to the City of Wilmington to continue implementing the Quick Response Team pilot project to address the needs of opiate and heroin overdose victims who are not getting follow-up treatment $10 million for beach renourishment and coastal storm damage projects $1 million for emerging compound monitoring and sampling Every single teacher raise Copyright © 2020, Committee to Elect Michael Lee, All rights reserved.

What's New in District 122 Howdy! We hope this note finds you safe and well. Happy belated Mother's Day to all the wonderful mothers out there. We hope you were able to enjoy your day despite dealing with the limitations on gatherings that is necessary to combat Coronavirus. Last week, we observed a heated exchange in Home Depot between a customer wearing a mask and another who wasn't wearing one. The two shoppers were standing six feet apart in the check out line. The person wearing the mask accused the one without of selfishness. His retort was that it was his personal choice to decide whether to wear a mask. Asymptomatic liberties are a quandary for the scholars and we can only hope that common sense will prevail. Be sensible, not selfish. We had planned to speak to members of the American Council of Engineering Companies Austin Chapter before the virus had taken hold in our state. Since we couldn't meet in person, we moved the meeting to Zoom. We had a great discussion about flood infrastructure funding, transportation projects, and the overall impact of Coronavirus on the state budget, and local governments’ ability to keep infrastructure projects going as tax revenues continue to decline. We appreciate the work these engineers do to keep our roads, bridges, dams, and other infrastructure in good shape. Texas Water Challenges Continue Through Pandemic While the Coronavirus has preoccupied so many of us over the past several weeks, folks in the Rio Grande Valley have been dealing with an additional challenge. Severe drought has taken hold in the Rio Grande Valley, compounding the impacts of Mexico's water debt to the United States on the Rio Grande. Lake Falcon, one of the international reservoirs on the Rio Grande, currently has less than 20% capacity. After learning of the dire water conditions affecting portions of south Texas, my office organized a virtual meeting between the federal and state officials, and local water suppliers in the Rio Grande Valley. Water suppliers for cities and irrigators predict they could be without water in June due to these water shortages, and are moving swiftly to secure alternative emergency water supplies to avert a public health crisis. We continue to work with Rep. Eddie Lucio III to advocate on behalf of the constituents in the Rio Grande Valley who depend on this water with the federal government, and require they push Mexico to fulfill its water obligation under the 1944 water treaty. Mexico's water debt is especially frustrating given the United States' consistent compliance with delivering on its water obligations on the Colorado River. You can see our press release below and read more about our efforts in this article. We have also participated in a virtual meeting with the Interregional Planning Council, created by legislation we passed during the 2019 Legislative Session to improve the state's water planning process, to share our thoughts on how the council could help the Legislature advance several water policy discussions. The Interregional Planning Council, made up of representatives from each of the state's sixteen geographic water planning regions, is designed to help address some of the fracturing inherent in the state's bottom-up water planning process. While some coordination is occurring among water planning regions, it's clear that that state's bottom-up approach to water planning can also discourage big-picture thinking, encourage parochial attitudes towards water resources, and result in counterproductive fighting among regions that have different visions for the development of water resources. At its inaugural meeting, the Council held a productive discussion on best practices and topics the council will tackle during the current planning cycle, including how to resolve interregional conflicts. We look forward to future discussions and recommendations that will help the state better prepare for its water future. You can learn more about what was discussed at the meeting here. Businesses Adapt to Our New Normal It has been very heartening to see folks help each other as we adapt to our new normal. Many businesses are working to stay afloat and have had to be creative to keep moving forward. The Barrios family, who run several restaurants throughout our community, adjusted its restaurant model and is now serving food to go in 6 different HEB locations. This is entrepreneurship in its truest form! COVID-19: Where We Are Today As of yesterday afternoon, 525,978 people have been tested statewide, with 39,869 testing positive, 21,713 recoveries and 1,100 deaths. In Bexar County, we hit a milestone last week as half the folks who contracted the virus have fully recovered. As you know, all school districts in Texas have moved to distance learning through the end of the school year. The City of San Antonio and Bexar County have extended their “Stay Home, Work Safe” orders through May 19 to coincide with Governor Greg Abbott’s “Open Texas” plan. Testing Yesterday, San Antonio Metro Health announced the expansion of COVID-19 testing to asymptomatic individuals. Until now, residents were required to show symptoms including a fever, dry cough, and chills. Now, folks will have access to testing even if they do not have any COVID-19 symptoms. To find a testing location, visit the City of San Antonio's COVID-19 website. On May 13, the Texas Military Department will begin conducting roving COVID testing sites throughout the state. The mobile testing teams are designed to focus on both rural areas that have not had access to testing and areas where an active outbreak requires additional testing capacity. See below for information about the testing sites in Bexar County. COVID-19 Dashboard Texas 2036 recently announced its launch of a COVID-19 dashboard to provide Texans a daily snapshot of how the pandemic is affecting Texans’ lives and livelihoods. You can check it out here. High School Graduations The TEA is providing four different pathways for schools to celebrate their graduating seniors, and each district is at liberty to determine if any of these options best serve the needs and desires of their community: * Completely virtual ceremonies that take place entirely online, with the use of videoconference or other technologies. * Hybrid ceremonies, which consist of a compilation of videos of students being recognized in person as they celebrate graduation in small groups. * Vehicle ceremonies, in which students and their families wait in their cars while other graduates are recognized one at time with their families alongside them. * Outdoor in-person ceremonies, which are currently permitted for counties as follows: Between May 15 and May 31, an outdoor ceremony may take place in a rural county that has an attestation as described in the Governor’s Report to Open Texas that remains in effect 7 days prior to the ceremony. An outdoor ceremony may take place in any Texas county on or after June 1. Texas Workforce Commission Unemployment Update Since the week ending March 14th, TWC has taken over 2.2 million claims for Unemployment Insurance and paid over $3.7 billion in Unemployment Insurance benefit payments to Texans affected by COVID19. Of that, $2.1 billion has been paid in the extra $600 per week payments, and $134.5 million has been paid in Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (not traditionally eligible). TWC’s four main call centers and four contracted call centers with a combined staffing of about 1,200 are still running 7:00 AM – 7:00 PM, Seven days a week. There continues to be high call volumes into the Tele-centers, on Monday there were 116,063 unique callers into the call centers who placed approximately 1.5 million call attempts to the tele-centers. Last week, TWC deployed an upgrade to Larry, the chat bot on the TWC website. This upgrade allows the chat bot to receive requests for a contact (call or email) back on the following questions: * Forgot my User ID * Forgot my email/password * Account already connected with my social security number * Need to update my application * I need to talk to someone These topics were selected for this initial launch because in all these scenarios, a claimant must speak to a TWC Customer Service Representative to resolve them. Since going online on March 30, the chat bot has answered 2.9 million questions for 805,606 individuals. TWC is also working to bring online the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program. This is the additional 13 weeks of Unemployment Insurance benefits passed in the CARES Act for those who have exhausted their regular state funded Unemployment Insurance benefits. Notices to those who have exhausted their benefits began going out Saturday with instructions for activating these additional benefits on their claims. TWC has also deployed a “virtual lobby” to the online Unemployment Benefits System. This lobby activates when traffic on the system gets high to ensure that that the system does not slow down. When it deploys, the user sees a wait time in the form of a countdown timer until they are granted access to the system. Mental Health Resources Last week, Governor Abbott announced that the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) has received $5.8 million in federal funding to provide crisis counseling services to Texans who have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional resources visit the Mental Health & Substance Use Resources web page. Plan to Open Texas Last week, Governor Abbott issued an Executive Order to expand openings of certain businesses and activities. The order allows wedding venues to immediately open, though weddings held indoors other than at a church must limit occupancy to 25%. Wedding reception services may also resume, but facilities must limit their occupancy to 25% of the total listed occupancy. Beginning last Friday, cosmetology salons, hair salons, barber shops, nail salons and shops, and other establishments where licensed cosmetologists or barbers practice their trade, can re-open, but they must ensure at least six feet of social distancing between operating work stations. Beginning May 18, office buildings may open with the greater of five or less individuals or 25% of the total office workforce. These individuals must maintain appropriate social distancing. Gyms, exercise facilities, and exercise classes may also open on May 18, but must operate at 25% occupancy. Locker rooms and shower facilities will remain closed, but restrooms may open. Non-essential manufacturing services may also open on May 18 but facilities must limit their occupancy to 25%. Businesses in all industries have worked hard to adapt to the Coronavirus challenge. The Texas Restaurant Association issued the "Texas Restaurant Promise" to ensure safety in restaurants as they open back up. Texas State Parks As part of the broader effort to reopen Texas, Texas State Parks will resume limited overnight camping beginning May 18. All visitors are required to pre-purchase and print day-use and overnight camping permits through the Texas State Parks Reservation System before traveling to a park. All reservations can be made online at [[URL REDACTED]] or by calling 512-389-8900. Existing social distancing standards and public health recommendations remain in effect including the recommendation to wear face coverings and bring one’s own supply of hand sanitizer. State parks will also continue the requirement of a six-foot distance from individuals outside of their party, including the prohibition of the gathering of groups larger than five that are not part of the same family or household. COVID-19: Current Data South Korea's Success in Combatting the Virus South Korea has proven to be a model for dealing with COVID-19. Robust testing, tracing, and discipline exercised by each individual are the keys to their success. For more about South Korea's approach, take a look at this article. Looking Ahead Due to the Coronavirus shutdown, more than 1.8 million Texans have filed for unemployment benefits. Last month, the price of oil fell to negative numbers, meaning producers were paying buyers to take the oil off their hands. Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar announced that state sales tax revenue had dropped 9.3% from the previous month. The sales tax is the State's largest revenue source; it funds 57% of our total budget. Our economic situation presents a monumental challenge to the Legislature when we reconvene in January. The Texas Constitution requires that the Legislature pass a balanced budget, so cuts will be inevitable. Texas Senate Finance Committee Chairwoman Jane Nelson recently announced that she has instructed state agencies that zero based budgeting will be used when writing the biennial budget in the coming legislative session. Additionally, because we have carefully managed the state's rainy day fund, it currently holds $10.2 billion, which can be used to plug budget holes if needed. Here is the breakdown of the state's $250.7 billion budget for 2020-21. Holding Elections in a Pandemic Over the last 30 years my office has supported allowing military service members stationed abroad, senior citizens, disabled individuals and folks out of the county on election day to vote by mail. COVID-19 has changed many things about our daily life, and it will impact the way we hold elections in Texas. With the need to continue social distancing into the near future, we are investigating how to best conduct the fall election to keep folks safe and healthy. Some have suggested allowing all eligible Texas voters to vote by mail, not just certain segments of the population, like other states including Oregon and Colorado do. We want to know what you think about this. Can you tell us in this quick survey? How You Can Help As we continue to face the economic challenges created by this virus, those of us in a position to help others have many opportunities to do so. My office recently donated needed items to Child Advocates San Antonio and The Children's Shelter. If you are in a position to help folks in our community get through this difficult time, here are some ideas: * Donate to the San Antonio Food Bank * Look out for possible child abuse, report it to child abuse hotline. Experts say instances of child abuse are likely to rise as tensions rise and families are home during this period of isolation. * Donate items to Child Advocates San Antonio, ChildSafe, or The Children's Shelter. * Give Blood \- make an appointment with the South Texas Blood and Tissue Center. * Deliver food for Meals on Wheels. * Help local business stay afloat by ordering takeout from restaurants. Here is a list of local restaurants offering takeout, curbside, and delivery service. ‪Daybreak in the morning on the water reminds us all that everyday we are blessed with a new beginning and anything is possible with a good attitude. ‬ Amor Fati Carpe Diem!

What's New in District 122 Good morning! We hope you had a memorable Easter. While it was very different for many who are used to enjoying attending church and celebrations with family, we know that isolation and social distancing are making the difference in combating this menacing virus. We have received a lot of correspondence from folks who are concerned about both the continuation of the spread of the virus across our state and the economic effect it is having on businesses. Some countries in Europe and various US states are working to slowly open up businesses that have been categorized as non-essential or businesses adversely impacted by stay-at-home orders. The conventional thought in Washington, DC and across our nation is to continue using testing to determine the intensity of the spread and establish who has already been infected and recovered. The infectious disease experts and historical data indicate that the virus will persist for another 12 to 18 months before we have a cure or vaccine. Hopefully, the cure will come much sooner than that for the folks who are infected. No elected official has the insight or clairvoyance to know exactly what is the right course going forward, but adapting to a highly contagious virus is doable if humility and science are our guiding principles. The template that has been laid out for the states is to create a task force comprised of health officials and business groups to determine when and how each state will roll out the return to a semblance of normal business operations. Infection testing, immunity testing and the epidemiological curve will be the drivers behind which communities will emerge first in this model. Many essential businesses have continued to operate successfully in the last month. They have also developed protocols to protect their employees and customers that we can all learn from and adapt to our business operations. CDC guidelines and best practices are detailed here. Direct-contact businesses, like restaurants, will need to adjust their densities significantly over the next year and use innovative approaches to protect employees and patrons from being exposed. A Texas honor code adopted by each and every one of us will be necessary to self-quarantine and seek treatment ourselves if we feel the symptoms of the virus. We should expect that any mass gatherings will be severely limited until testing is widely available or a vaccine or cure is proven. As of today, we have tested 146,467 people in Texas with 14,624 testing positive. We CAN work through this period of history safely with medical science and disciplined distancing and hygiene. We need to use common sense, not fear, to chart our course going forward. This situation isn't ideal for anyone. But, for many, it has provided peace and a slower pace allowing us to reflect on our lives and be more introspective. What is one of the positive experiences you have had in this trying time? Please drop us a line and share your experience. Local Efforts Taken to Stop the Spread As you know, all school districts in Bexar County have moved to distance learning until May 4th. In his press conference on Monday, Governor Abbott indicated he will discuss whether public schools will return for the remainder of the school year by the end of this week. The City of San Antonio and Bexar County have issued “Stay Home, Work Safe” orders, requiring residents to only leave their homes only to get groceries, pick up takeout at restaurants, or receive needed medical care. These orders are in effect until April 30. No gatherings are permitted, except for household members. The orders require non-essential businesses to close to the public, but owners and employees can work from home. Essential businesses may keep operating. Testing is still available at the Freeman Coliseum testing site. Now, anyone who passes the screening and has an appointment is eligble to be tested. HEB and other retail stores have provided a template for small retail businesses to operate in this viral environment through the next year. This includes sanitizing carts, providing hand sanitizer, enforcing proper spacing in lines, many employees masked, and plastic “sneeze guard” panels at check out. State of Texas Efforts to Address COVID-19 Since the start of the pandemic in Texas, Governor Abbott has taken action through executive orders and waivers to improve preparedness to deal with confirmed cases, control the expansion of the virus and help mitigate its effect on various people and industries. You can view the executive orders here. Assisting folks who are grappling with the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic has become a major focus of the Governor's office, the Legislature and state agencies. Texas Workforce Commission Unemployment Insurance Claims TWC received 14 million calls last week which is down from 15 million the week prior. On April 7, TWC received over 3.4 million calls in a 24-hour period. Prior to COVID-19, on an average day, TWC would receive around 13,000 calls. The record number of calls before COVID-19 was 60,000 in a 24 hour period. TWC now has over 1,500 staff helping support unemployment insurance services and has upgraded and expanded telephone infrastructure and website capacity. They are actively hiring emergency personnel and receiving volunteers from other TWC departments and external partners. Hardware upgrades have been made to TWC’s Benefits System, and TWC added two third-party call centers to help take claims. An artificial intelligence-enabled chatbot has been added to the TWC homepage to provide answers to UI questions and 24/7. San Antonio Food Bank As folks continue to feel the economic strain resulting from this pandemic, many nonprofits are struggling to keep up with the need for their services. The San Antonio Food Bank has experienced unprecedented demand for food from folks across the region it serves. Cars lined up to collect food from the San Antonio Food Bank last week. Last week, the San Antonio Food Bank marked its largest single-day distribution in its 40-year history. Normally, the Food Bank distributes $3 million of its inventory per week, now, it is providing $6 million per week. The Food Bank is seeking $12 million worth of help from the State through the Texas Department of Emergency Management. The Bexar County legislative delegation sent a letter in support of this aid. The San Antonio Food Bank should be commended for stepping up in this moment of crisis. Texas Comptroller's Office Comptroller Glenn Hegar's office is offering assistance to businesses that are struggling to pay their sales taxes. It is offering short-term payment agreements and, in most instances, waivers of penalties and interest. Contact the Comptroller's Enforcement Hotline at 800-252-8880 or visit here to learn about your options for remaining in compliance and avoiding interest and late fees on taxes due. Current Data Federal Legislation Addressing COVID-19 Last month, Congress passed and President Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, a $2 trillion piece of federal legislation that intends to support the medical response to the pandemic, assist businesses struggling with the economic downturn, expand unemployment insurance, and provide direct cash payments to Americans in certain income brackets. You can find more detailed information here. How You Can Help First and foremost, the length of time it will take to "flatten the curve" depends on each of us. We all have a duty to continue to stay home, practice social distancing, and practice good hygiene. In addition to staying home, there are other things you can do to help. The following organizations need assistance to help folks in need. * Donate to the San Antonio Food Bank * Look out for possible child abuse, report it to child abuse hotline. Experts say instances of child abuse are likely to rise as tensions rise and families are home during this period of isolation. * Give Blood \- make an appointment with the South Texas Blood and Tissue Center * Help local business stay afloat by ordering takeout from restaurants. Here is a list of local restaurants offering takeout, curbside, and delivery service. What's Next? Governor Abbott indicated in his press conference this week that he will soon outline plans to get Texas back to work. He said the process will be slow and gradual to ensure public health is protected. Likely, many people will be concerned about returning to normal after social distancing for several weeks. Businesses in all industries will likely change their protocols to address public health concerns. In this vein, my office compiled information about COVID-19 precautions taken and best practices used by essential businesses in various industries. Here is a chart we put together that shows the efforts being taken by different companies. For reference, CDC standards are linked here. “America was not built on fear. America was built on courage, on imagination and an unbeatable determination to do the job at hand." - Harry S Truman Amor Fati Carpe Diem!

Our New Normal The last couple of months have been anything but normal. The summer kicked off just a few weeks ago and while it brought with it a sense of normalcy, things are still very different from what they were pre-COVID-19 pandemic. Our lives have changed dramatically and as the situation with the pandemic continues to evolve, so do the orders that have been issued by Governor Abbott regarding closures, requirements, and guidelines. Most recently, Governor Abbott issued Executive Order GA-29. This order went into effect July 3rd and requires that every person shall wear a face covering over the nose and mouth when inside a commercial entity or other building or space that is open to the public or when in an outdoor public place, wherever it is not feasible to maintain social distancing from another person not in the same household. There are some exceptions to who is required to wear a face cover and those can be found here along with the full order. Following a verbal or written warning for a first-time violator of this face-covering requirement, a person’s second violation shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed $250. Each subsequent violation shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed $250 per violation. GA-29 applies to counties that have 20 or more positive cases of COVID-19 and it can be enforced by local local law enforcement. While I do not support a mandate that criminalizes citizens for not wearing a mask, I do support asking Texans to voluntarily wear a mask where appropriate. As a representative for seven rural counties, I have been heartbroken to see so many businesses crippled by the COVID-19 response. Pushing these mask mandates onto businesses feels like adding insult to injury. These are largely family-owned businesses, some of which have been around longer than I have been alive. Our change in habits has already forced many more businesses to make the toughest calls an employer can make. It seems like common sense that wearing a mask does limit your ability to unknowingly spread the virus if you are asymptomatic. If covering your mouth when you cough during cold season is acceptable, then it is reasonable to think that masks can dramatically limit the spread of airborne germs and viral contagions like COVID-19. As your friend and State Representative, I’m asking you to wear a mask when appropriate. Stay home if possible and follow proper hygiene and social distancing protocols if you have to go out. Be a good neighbor, be mindful of others, and most importantly be kind to one another for we are all in this together. If you would like to receive real-time updates from me and my team, especially now during this pandemic, please click the button below to follow along on Facebook. Representative Ben Leman Facebook # 2020-2021 School Year A couple of weeks ago, the Texas Education Agency (TEA) released its guidelines for a safe return to on campus instruction for the 2020-2021 school year. Due to the pandemic, parents will be able to choose between in class learning and remote instruction for their children. If a parent chooses to do remote instruction, they can choose to do so at the beginning of the school year or at any point as the school year progresses. Parents who choose remote instruction for their children may be asked to commit to remote instruction for a full grading period (e.g. 6 or 9 weeks), but will not have to make that commitment more than two weeks in advance, so they can make a decision based on the latest public health information. Schools will also have to follow certain mandated health procedures including COVID-19 symptom screenings for all students, teachers, staff, and visitors who will be going to a campus. The screening must be done before they are allowed on campus. Consistent with the Governor’s most recent executive order, and assuming that order is still in place, masks will be required while in school buildings, with certain exceptions made, as noted in the order. Schools will also be required to follow any forthcoming executive orders issued by the Governor. Additional health procedures are recommended for every school that can reasonably implement those procedures. School districts will have the option to establish a phased-in return to on-campus instruction for up to the first three weeks of the school year, to ensure all appropriate health and safety procedures are fully in place. A link to TEA's comprehensive public health guidance can be found here. Due to the variety of learning options for the coming school year, the University Interscholastic League (UIL) has released information regarding UIL student eligibility. Those guidelines can be found below: * Students participating in remote learning offered by their school district, whether synchronous or asynchronous (as defined by TEA), may participate in UIL activities if they meet all other UIL eligibility requirements. Students must be enrolled in remote learning options through the school the student will represent. Schools may develop local policies with additional requirements for participation. You can find more information related to the full-time student rule in the UIL Constitution and Contest Rules. * Schools should develop grading policies for remote learning options that outline the criteria for determining if a student is passing all courses at the end of grading and evaluation periods. Days when school is not in session should be treated as school holidays for purposes of determining academic eligibility for both remote and in-person learning. All students are academically eligible when school is not in session for a full calendar week or more. More information related to no pass-no play can be found in the TEA-UIL Side by Side Manual. * For the 2020-2021 school year, UIL eligibility requirements for the first six weeks of school have been modified to allow a student to be eligible for the first six weeks if they accumulated at least two and a half credits since the start of the 2019-2020 school year. Schools may impose additional requirements. # Texas Higher Education Emergency Education Relief Funding A couple of weeks ago, Governor Abbott announced that the State of Texas will invest $57 million in federal funds to maintain the state’s need-based financial aid programs and keep more students enrolled at their colleges and universities. The investment of federal funds will offset potential coronavirus-related cuts to key state financial aid programs, including TEXAS Grants, Texas Educational Opportunity Grants, and Tuition Equalization Grants. The funding comes from the Governor’s Emergency Education Relief Fund made available through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act signed into law by President Trump. # Contact Tracing Update Many of you have continued to express concerns with the agreement the State of Texas has entered into with a company to participate in contact tracing. This includes contacting an individual who has tested positive for COVID-19, documenting their location, and identifying who they have been in contact with to trace where the disease may have been spread. The Department of State Health Services (DSHS) has been tasked with contact tracing in Texas. Due to the slow, but steady rise of COVID-19 cases in Texas, the agency scaled back on the number of contact tracers they had working to track an individuals initial exposure of the virus and their subsequent contact with others. Because of the spike in COVID-19 cases over the last couple of weeks, the contact tracers have seen an increase in their workload and DSHS assures they have enough tracers to meet with the surge in cases. Although the program is completely voluntary, I still have some concerns and I am opposed to this idea. My staff and I will continue to monitor this program as it progresses and will keep you up to date on it. # Fighter for Free Enterprise The 86th Legislative Session brought forward many victories for businesses in Texas with the passage of several bills that encourage economic growth and support Texas businesses. Some of the most notable business related bills that passed this session include House Bill 3143 (Ch. 312 tax abatements), House Bill 696 (provides veterans with greater services and programs aimed assisting in the transition from military to civilian life), House Bill 1525 (requires a marketplace provider to collect sales and use tax for the state in which the sale is made even if they are not physically located in the state), and Senate Bill 2 (limiting the amount of property tax increase placed on homeowners and business). As a business owner myself, I understand the importance of being in an environment that is conducive of positive outcomes for businesses. I was proud to support many of the pro-business bills from this past legislative session and I am honored to have received the recognition of "Fighter for Free Enterprise" from the Texas Association of Business. While legislators do not directly create jobs, it is our duty to create policies that have a positive effect on the business environment in Texas. It is imperative we keep the regulatory burden low and keep our state as one of the best in the nation to do business in. Businesses all over the state, whether they be mom and pop shops or big box stores, have been affected by the economic downfall COVID-19 has brought forward. But Texas and Texas business owners are resilient and I know that we will get through this. I have been very vocal in supporting businesses during the pandemic, especially in rural districts where COVID-19 case counts are not as high. Our economy needs to keep going and we must avoid another shut down. Our entire way of life in our country depends on a healthy economy and we must have a balanced agreement in fighting COVID-19. Protect our health, protect our economy. I had an amazing time celebrating freedom a few weeks ago at the 170th Fourth of July parade in Round Top. It was awesome to hear all of the cheers supporting President Trump and Vice President Pence. I hope everyone had a safe and fun 4th of July! # Mobile District Office Sedonia Powell, our wonderful District Director, with whom many of you have visited over the years, has transitioned to a part-time schedule in order to spend more time with family, especially her grandchildren. Although Sedonia will be spending less time with us, she will still be around and will continue to serve the constituents of HD 13. Due to this transition I am pleased to announce the newest addition to our office, Leigh Linden. Leigh will take on the role of Deputy District Director and will be working with Sedonia to continue to provide exceptional services to our constituents. Our mobile office schedule will remain the same with Leigh taking over the mobile office visits. This week you can find Leigh in Burleson County, Burleson County Courthouse, room 305, from 9:00 AM to 11:30 AM. If the mobile district office scheduled times do not work for you, please feel free to call the district office at 979-836-1238 to arrange an appointment for a time that does works best for you.

POLICY FOR JUSTICE On Tuesday of this week, Senator John Whitmire and I announced that we are committed to passing a package of policies next legislative session that will improve our criminal justice system. We are developing this legislation to honor George Floyd and his family, Sandra Bland and her family, and all the other families seeking justice and change. Implicit Bias Training The first important change happened within the last week. On Thursday, June 4th, I requested that the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement (TCOLE) require implicit bias training as part of their basic peace officer training course. TCOLE, which is responsible for licensing and training standards for law enforcement in Texas, fulfilled my request and added implicit bias training components to the first unit (Professionalism and Ethics) of the basic peace officer training course, and emphasized the need for de-escalation training later in the course. Implicit bias is the automatic association people make between people and stereotypes regarding that group of people. Implicit bias training helps individuals identify their bias, and works to retrain their mind to take these biases out of their decision making process. Doing so allows for better and more objective decision making. Click here to read the Houston Chronicle story on this improvement. That was a good start, but more changes in policing and criminal justice policy need to be made at every level of government. I will be doing my part at the state level to push for reform that will ensure equal treatment for people of color, increase transparency and accountability, and keep both law enforcement and the public safer. I am glad to see that other local Democratic leaders such as Mayor Sylvester Turner, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, and Harris County Commissioner Rodney Ellis have already started to push for changes as well. Additionally, at the federal level, Houston Congressman Al Green and Congresswomen Shelia Jackson Lee are pushing for change in D.C. Rep. Garnet Coleman introducing Sen. John Whitmire at a Legislative Study Group Reception (2018) In 2017, Senator Whitmire and I passed the Sandra Bland Act, which included key reforms such as de-escalation training, greater data collection on traffic stops and arrests, a universal compliment/complaint section on each ticket, and other reforms that reduce jailing people for minor violations away and make our jails safer. Please click here to read a much more in-depth analysis of the important criminal justice policies passed in the Sandra Bland Act. The following session we passed HB 4468 to increase jail safety by strengthening the Texas Commission on Jail Standards’ oversight of privately operated jails; expanding the prisoner safety fund; requiring jailers to be enrolled in basic training within 90 days of receiving their temporary license; and preventing a temporary jailer from becoming a supervisor. This upcoming session we will be working to pass a package that will include policies that were in the original Sandra Bland Act that did not make it into the bill, along with new policies that will help bring about real criminal justice reform for people of color. Traffic Stops One of many common sense policies that were in the original Sandra Bland Act that we want to pass this session is prohibiting arrests for non-jailable, fine-only offenses. For example, it makes no sense to arrest someone for allegedly failing to use a turn signal when the worst punishment you can receive if found guilty is a fine with no jail time. This change is long overdue and would have been in place a decade ago if then Governor Perry had not vetoed it. Another policy from the original Sandra Bland Act that needs to be revived relates to how law enforcement conducts traffic stops. Because the data collection requirements in the Sandra Bland Act were passed, we have a better picture of how law enforcement continues to use traffic stops to target people of color. The use of pre-text stops of drivers of color leads to a disproportionate number of fines and arrests. Regrettably, these stops are allowed constitutionally because of the Supreme Court case Terry v. Ohio, hence they are sometimes referred to as Terry stops. However, we can pass a law to prohibit these unjust stops. Another practice that we need to prohibit from traffic stops is consent searches. Consent searches cause unnecessary confusion because it can be unclear to a driver if a police officer who asks to search your car is giving a command or making a request. Searches should be limited to instances where an officer has probable cause to search a vehicle. Racial Profiling Another element from the original Sandra Bland Act, would make improvements to our racial profiling law. Under current law it is very difficult to prove in court that racial discrimination is happening because data that could help a judge or jury get a more complete picture of a case is difficult evidence to get admitted at trial. We need to modify the statute to make it clear that this type of evidence is admissible in court. This, along with adding additional transparency to police records and more robust internal investigations into complaints, will give the public more trust in the [[URL REDACTED]] is a false choice saying that we cannot fund both the police and these alternative initiatives to keeping our communities safe. Improve Safety—Not Defund the Police In addition to policies in the original Sandra Bland Act, I will be looking at other reforms. However, simply de-funding the police is not a viable solution, law enforcement plays a vital role in keeping our communities safe and solving and preventing crime. The focus should be on improving law enforcement AND funding alternative initiatives to keeping our communities safe. Houston council-member Letitia Plummer outlined some initiatives we could fund to help keep our communities safer at Wednesday's city council meeting. Such as allocating funding to an independent police oversight board, additional de-esclation and implicit bias training for officers, increased funding for Houston's "My Brother's Keeper" program, and funding a Crisis Assistance: Helping Out On The Streets (CAHOOTS) program where social workers and police work together to solve problems. To have safer communities we need both better law enforcement and better alternatives, not one or the other.

Two more important policies we can put in place that could have prevented a death like George Floyd’s are prohibiting chokeholds by law enforcement and requiring officers to intervene if they see a colleague violating protocol. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner plans to issue an executive order prohibiting chokeholds and strangleholds. Far too often this technique has proven to be too dangerous and had deadly consequences. Mayor Turner’s order will also require officers to intervene if they see a colleague violating protocol. We need to act to replicate what we are doing here in Houston and put these reforms into state law. One of the major achievements of the Sandra Bland Act was requiring de-escalation training for law enforcement, and now Mayor Turner and other mayors are considering mandating that law enforcement officers must attempt to de-escalate situations before using force. Officers should be required to get training in tactical communication in a class that builds upon de-escalation training. If we are going to require our officers to do this, we need to make sure we make sure they are getting enough of the proper training. This is not an exhaustive list, but a starting point for policies that I will be working on to keep our communities safer. I would like to thank many of you who have reached out to my office with input. Together we can make change happen. CONTINUE TO WORK SMART AND STAY SAFE We are still in the middle of a pandemic, so it is important that we still all work together to help slow the spread of COVID-19. If you are part of the population who has a high risk for severe illness please such as those 65 years and older, or who have an underlying health condition, please stay home as much as possible. If you do go out please practice good hygiene and public health safety measures when you do go out. Such as: * practice social distancing; * limit when you go out in public; * when you do go out wear a face mask; and * wash your hands and avoid touching your face. There are people whose work requires them to go out to help us all stay safe, healthy, and fed. We can help those essential workers by staying home. If we work together, we can do our best to minimize the number of deaths by following the recommendations above and encouraging our friends and family to do the same. COVID-19 RESOURCE UPDATES As our community continues to work to slow the spread of the coronavirus, I wanted to make you aware of some of the resources out there to help you through this difficult time.

This week we have seen an increase in COVID-19 positive cases and hospitalizations statewide, especially in the metropolitan areas. Community spread was anticipated as we reopened Texas for business and we prepared for this. However, it is critical Texans remain vigilant in doing their part to slow the spread. We want to keep people safe and keep our economy open and moving forward! One of the first things Texas did to prepare for the spread of the virus was to very aggressively identify hospital bed capacity to dedicate for COVID-19 patients and increase surge capacity both within a hospital and even outside the four walls of a hospital, if necessary. We have identified substantial hospital capacity and we are in a really good place right now even with the uptick in hospitalizations. We continue to monitor this daily and have a clear path for ramping up bed space if needed. As of earlier this week, there were over 14,993 beds available which is a 78% increase in available beds since mid-March. Additionally, a team was assigned to procure personal protective equipment for Texas. If you recall, one reason for shutting down the elective surgeries and other doctor visits was to redirect PPE resources to our front-line workers caring for COVID-19 patients and we had a shortage in PPE. We no longer face a shortage and in fact, Texas has distributed 636 thousand coveralls, 3.29 million face shields, 17.5 million gloves, 5.6 million gowns and 66.4 million face masks. We have also learned a lot about the virus over the last few months like what population is most vulnerable, how it spreads and overall have more knowledge on how to treat patients. We have now taken care of many individuals for several months and have better knowledge of what alternative care methods to use and medicines that have responded well to the virus. Although we never want any loss of life, it’s reassuring how many have recovered. There are many things to be encouraged by not only with our statewide preparedness but also how things look at the local level. We have a large healthy population in Parker and Wise counties and our positive cases are low when you take into consideration our population and close proximity to the metroplex. We are seeing a lot of recoveries and very minimal hospitalizations. As much as we all want life to be normal, we are living with this highly contagious (although not nearly as deadly as we thought) virus and we need to be steadfast in our efforts to keep Texas safe and help to keep Texas open. Every Texan needs to do their part. The goal remains to ensure public safety AND have a strong robust economy. Please help me continue to spread the word for common sense good hygiene. Hope you and your families are doing well. State Representative Phil King represents Parker and Wise counties in the Texas House of Representatives. * * * Pol. ad. paid for by Phil King.

Is this email not displaying correctly? View it in your browser. Dear Constituents: Are you still trying to wrap your head around our temporary new norm of social distancing, take-out meals and virtual learning? We may wonder is this all necessary but given what we know today and what we have learned from our past—the closures, social distancing, staying home and all the caution is the right thing to do. So please be patient. And be grateful we’re in Texas with great leadership and amazing resources to soon put this day behind us. The primary goal remains delaying and slowing the spread of the virus to protect our health care system and vulnerable population. This is a shared responsibility for all of us. As things are quickly evolving with COVID-19, I wanted to share some resources that I have found informative and helpful. The Department of Health Services has many answers to frequently asked questions like what do you do if you’re sick, information on testing and prevention tips. This will also include updated numbers of cases in Texas. See link HERE. DSHS is also regularly sending updates through social media accounts available by following TexasDSHS on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Here are a few simple, common sense measures we can all implement to slow the spread. How can Texans slow the spread of COVID-19? * The next two weeks are critical in slowing the spread of COVID-19. Texans must act now. * Stay home as much as possible, especially if you are sick, older, and/or have a medical condition. * If you are sick, stay home except to access medical care. If you are able to take care of yourself, stay home. If you need to see your doctor, call ahead. * Avoid gatherings of more than 10 people and non-essential trips into public. * Cancel events of more than 10 people. * Limit close contact (at least six feet) with other people. Employers should allow alternative work options as much as possible. Who can be tested for COVID-19? DSHS broadened the public health criteria on March 15th so that people can get tested through the public health system under a variety of scenarios. Public health labs will test individuals (including health care workers) who have fever and/or symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath) AND: * have had close contact with a confirmed case; * have traveled to a location with ongoing transmission of COVID-19; * have risk factors for poor outcomes from COVID-19; or, * are hospitalized with fever and symptoms suspicious for COVID-19 even if they do not have any risk factors. Texas’ response to COVID-19 outbreak has been impressive and ongoing with Governor Abbott declaring a State of Disaster, allowing Texans and local business relief for various hurdles and strains they are facing during this difficult time. Here is a summary of various waivers and exemptions that have been provided by the State just this week. I would expect more to follow in the coming weeks as we continue response efforts and discover new challenges. Update on State Waivers and Exemptions in Effect Statewide Television Townhall - March 19th at 7:00 PM Governor Greg Abbott announced he will be holding a live virtual Town Hall meeting on Thursday, March 19, 2020 at 7:00 p.m. CT. The Governor will discuss the statewide response to the current coronavirus outbreak and will be joined by top officials from the Department of State Health Services, the Texas Division of Emergency Management, and the Texas Education Agency. For additional information, follow the link here. Impact on May 2020 Local Elections A proclamation on March 18, 2020 suspending provisions of the Texas Election Code to allow political subdivisions to postpone their 2020 local elections. This means local governments now have the ability to postpone their May 2, 2020 elections until November 3, 2020. To view the press release on this topic, please visit here. TxDPS to Waive Expiration Dates on Certain Licenses and IDs Department of Public Safety (DPS) will temporarily waive expiration dates for Driver Licenses, Commercial Driver Licenses, and other identification forms. This action falls within the State of Disaster Declaration and is part of the ongoing effort to reduce to spread of COVID-19. This suspension will be in effect until 60 days after DPS provides further public notice that normal Driver License operations have resumed. In addition to this suspension, drive license offices across the state are closing immediately. This temporary closure will not apply to those seeking an initial Commercial Driver License (CDL). To view the press release on these topics, please visit announcements here and here. Certain TDI Regulations on Telemedicine Waived The State has waived certain regulations related to telemedicine care and directed the Texas Department of Insurance (TDI) to issue an emergency rule to help patients with state-regulated insurance plans gain telemedicine access so doctors across Texas can help additional patients while mitigating the spread of COVID-19. To view the press release on this topic, please visit here. Request for Loan Assistance for Small Businesses On March 17, 2020, the State requested designation from the Small Business Administration (SBA) Economic Injury Disaster Declaration in order for small businesses across the state of Texas to access the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program. If granted, the SBA would provide relief through long-term, low-interest loans to qualifying Texas businesses. To view the press release on this topic, please visit here. Activation of the Texas National Guard Texas has activated the Texas National Guard so they are prepared to assist with response efforts for COVID-19 if needed. This preparative step will ensure that the Texas National Guard can assist in various forms throughout the state at a moment’s notice. Healthcare workers and first responders who are members of the Texas National Guard are excluded from this activation so that they can continue serving the people of Texas in their respective fields. To view the press release on this topic, please visit here. TxDMV to Waive Rules on Disability Parking Placards and Vehicle Registration and Titling Governor Abbott has announced that Texas is waiving certain rules relating to vehicle registration, parking placards for persons with disabilities, and titling to aid the state's efforts to combat COVID-19. These suspensions will allow Texans to avoid penalties for failure to timely title or register a vehicle, or renew a parking placard. The waivers fall within the actions the are being taken under the State of Disaster, and are part of Texas’ efforts to reduce in-person contact among Texans and slow the spread of COVID-19. To view the press release on this topic, please visit here. Waiver of Certain Regulations to Allow Delivery of Alcohol from Restaurants and to Support Hospitality Industry The State issued a waiver that will allow restaurants to deliver alcoholic beverages with food purchases to patrons, including beer, wine and mixed drinks. Also Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (TABC) will waive certain provisions to allow manufacturers, wholesale and retailers of alcoholic beverages to repurchases or sell back unopened product. This is an effort to support retailers, restaurants and their employees. To view the press release on this topic, please visit here. Update from the Texas Education Agency Following the announcement last week to waive the STAAR test requirement for the 2019-20 school year, Texas Education Agency (TEA) Commissioner Mike Morath sent a letter to school administrators today cancelling the STAAR test for this year. TEA will work with the United States Department of Education to request waivers from federal testing and accountability requirements for the 2019–2020 school year. To read Commissioner Morath’s letter, follow the link here. I will do my best to keep you updated as we continue to make decisions that are in the best interest of all Texans.

Here's what you can do... View this email in your browser Hey there Alex, It's not particularly fun to discuss the Coronavirus (Covid-19) and what to do in case an outbreak happens, but it has. A man and his family have tested presumptive positive for it and as a result, the team here at Bado for Texas has been following it closely. Here is what you should do Do * Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds (this is just common sense) * Stay home if you are sick * Cough into your elbow and dispose of any tissue in the proper bin * Avoid large gatherings of people you don't know * Ensure you have the proper supplies at home in case you or someone in your family gets quarantined (This doesn't mean buy out all of the supplies at the grocery store) Don't * Wear a mask unless you are sick or are directed to by a healthcare provider. The only other time it's acceptable to wear a mask is if you believe you'll be in contact with someone who might have the virus * Travel if you have a fever or fever-like symptoms * Panic. We are still at LOW-RISK and have not moved up according to our county officials, Texas Department of Health and Human Services, and the CDC * Take antibiotics. Coronavirus is a virus.

Alex, Giovanni Capriglione voted against Medicaid expansion in Texas. Because of his disastrous vote, Texas has the dubious distinction of having the deadliest uninsured rate in the country. Bottom line, Medicaid expansion would allow over 1 million Texans to gain coverage, meaning routine services like doctor’s appointments, treatment for chronic illness, and emergency medical aid would become affordable and accessible. Not to mention, Texans already pay for Medicaid through the federal government but don’t reap the monetary or public health benefits. Medicaid expansion would save local taxpayers $4.3 billion dollars across Texas, some 303,000 new jobs would be created annually, and $525 million in new tax revenue would be generated. Elected officials like my opponent have voted against the expansion of Medicaid funding from the federal government. #GioGottaGo! I will always support of common sense legislation that will support our low-income families, keep us all healthier, and save taxpayers’ money. I’m #AlwaysForUs! Your support of my campaign will help elect a candidate who will vote for Medicaid expansion, which will in turn help lower the cost of health insurance for all Texans.

View this email in your browser Dear Friends, Summer has arrived and with it comes a great sense of optimism for Texans as we re-open our businesses and social gatherings. Texas is now successfully in "Phase II" and we are cautiously striving for the total 100% restoration of every business and recreational activity in the state. My office receives, researches and studies an enormous amount of data related to COVID-19 and I want to share as much as possible with everyone in my senate district. The best info and observations often come from you, my constituents! Rest assured, our office is listening to you, through every phone call, letter and email. Everyone, all 29 million Texans, have been impacted by this virus and subsequent shutdown. That's why my office is doing its best to answer every question, and push for common sense solutions. Provable facts are a precious commodity during a time like this, and I hope to always be a trusted and reliable source of info. Below you will find an abundance of links which may serve as useful resources: HOSPITALS AND DOCTORS: We owe a huge thanks to our first responders and healthcare workers. To be a caregiver in today's environment means putting the lives of others ahead of your own, which is the true definition of sacrifice. My office has often been asked about seeking treatment for non-coronavirus illnesses. The question being, is it safe to visit doctors, receive treatment or surgeries at a hospital or outpatient center? The answer is yes. If you have a chronic disease or urgent health concern it is vital that you seek medical attention. Surgeries are being performed daily and the hospitals across our state have worked hard to make the environment extremely safe. The federal CARES Act provided $175 billion to our hospitals, nursing homes and providers to assist with financial difficulties during the shutdown and realign to care for illnesses separate from COVID-19. Remember, the original effort to “flatten the curve” was simply to briefly shelter-in-place to prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed. Texans did their part and that chapter is now behind us. At one point we had over 22,000 empty hospital beds available, which is incredible when you consider that the highest number of people hospitalized for COVID-19 in Texas has been 1,888. Going forward, all hospitals are required to set aside 15% of bed capacity if needed for virus, with the remaining space available for any other type of healthcare need. During a conference call with the White House last week, I heard Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar report that there will be 75,000 deaths not related to COVID-19, but due to government lockdowns and blanket closures of the economy. It's a staggering number, when we factor in deaths from postponed non-coronavirus healthcare, as well as potential increases in suicide, domestic abuse and violent crime. LONGTERM CARE/NURSING HOMES/ASSISTED LIVING: Instead of blanket shutdowns of entire economies, it is wise to focus on how COVID-19 has been dangerous and deadly specifically for our elderly and those in congregate care. In Texas, as of today nearly half of all deaths are residents of longterm care facilities. And of those deaths, approximately 75% were age 65 and over. And those over 80 account for 40% of deaths in Texas, according to numbers provided by the Texas Department of State Health Services. This is why I have been very active in this area, working to see that resources are dedicated directly to our nursing homes. They need and deserve our full attention. My office has received calls from families who understandably want to have personal interaction and visits with residents in longterm care. This week, Governor Abbott and Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) announced $3.6 million in funds for nursing facilities to purchase tablet computers, webcams and headphones to connect residents with their loved ones during the challenges of COVID-19. State officials are encouraging nursing facility providers to submit applications to HHSC to receive up to $3000 per facility for purchasing communication technology devices. ASSISTANCE FOR AGRICULTURE PRODUCERS: The USDA has begun accepting applications for the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, or CFAP, which will provide financial assistance to farmers and ranchers who have suffered a five percent or greater price decline or who had losses due to supply chain disruptions. Applications will be accepted until Aug. 28. BY THE NUMBERS: For those interested in doing their own research instead of relying solely on media reports, here is the link for the Department of State Health Services dashboard. There are several “tabs” that can help you directly access charts and track recent trends. Just this week, the Centers for Disease and Control announced the current mortality rate of 0.4%. That is far less than the original model predictions of 3.0% to 4.0%. President Donald Trump announced Operation Warp Speed to develop safe and effective Coronavirus treatments and vaccines as quickly as possible. Operation Warp Speed marks a massive science, industrial, and logistical endeavor unlike anything the country has seen since the Manhattan Project. President Trump has directed nearly $10 billion to Operation Warp Speed through funding that was included in the CARES Act. The FDA has created a special emergency program for possible therapies, the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program (CTAP). As of May 11, 2020, the snapshot is: 144 active trials of therapeutic agents; Another 457 development programs for therapeutic agents in the planning stages. As reported by an interactive map by Axios, Texas death rate is one of the lowest per 100,000 in the US: 6 deaths per 100,000 compared to neighboring states like Louisiana at 59; New Mexico at 16; and Oklahoma at 8. Additionally, Axios shows that between May 19-May 26, the 7-day average of new cases is down 25%. All good news! Governor Greg Abbott issued a proclamation expanding additional services and activities that can open under Phase II of the State's plan to safely and strategically open. With this proclamation, water parks, recreational sport programs for adults, driver education programs, and food-court dining areas within shopping malls can begin operations with limited occupancy or regulations to protect the health and safety of Texans. On a related note, lately my office has been logging questions and comments about the issue of "contact tracing." This is a proposal for government "tracers" to contact those with COVID-19 and track down anyone in contact with that person. The idea of "government tracers" tends to make many people nervous, including me. Recently I visited with Gov. Abbott for over an hour to learn more about the recent contract our state entered for contact tracing. He has assured me that it is to be a purely voluntary exercise that respects our privacy. Still, many questions remain and I will maintain a healthy dose of skepticism. Government does not need to track us. Period. As we enter June, there are many positive events happening such as graduations, youth sports and more business and recreational openings. I encourage you to take advantage of all of them. I never realized how much I took simple things for granted, like watching Jake play baseball or Lois Kate cheer a football game. I'm sure you thought about similar moments in your family. The bottom line is that it's time to restart our lives, restore our economy and reopen our state. Texans will do as Texans do. We will stay tough, practice good hygiene, stick together and find a way through this dark time. Sincerely, Senator Lois W.

View this email in your browser Dear Friends, The global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has not spared Texas, with cases increasing and public life being temporarily upended across our state. To be clear, we are well equipped to contain and control this situation. As Chair of the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services and your state senator, I would like to report on how our state, federal and local governments are working together to protect our health and safety. I will also share suggested precautions to protect you and your family, and share several links for you to research and better understand the illness and past pandemics. We will get through this challenge. Our state is working 24-7 to coordinate a response to this disaster, and we are using every tool at our disposal. Earlier today, I joined a conference call with Governor Abbott shortly before he declared the new coronavirus a statewide public health disaster. At the same time, President Trump also announced today that he is declaring a national emergency, to deliver an estimated $50 billion directly to the states impacted. Texas is massively increasing our testing capacity, setting up drive-through testing capabilities in San Antonio, and other larger population centers, as well as streamlining how agencies and health providers work together to deliver care. My top priority is to collaborate with my colleagues at all levels of government to do whatever it takes to get rid of this threat as soon as possible. Governor Abbott continues to hold calls with state lawmakers, as well as mayors and county judges so that we can rapidly respond to local needs. Yesterday we heard updates from Dr. John Hellerstedt, Commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, Nim Kidd, Director of the Texas Department of Emergency Management and Mike Morath, Commissioner of the Texas Education Agency. Here are some of my notes from these conversations: \--State agencies are collaborating with each other and working well with local officials. \--As the virus continues to spread, much will be done to focus on the elderly who are most at risk. \--Testing capabilities are vastly expanding and will be done as needed per a doctor's recommendation. \--Local governments will make decisions regarding cancelling events and other public health matters. \--Local public health officials are vital to sources of information about your specific region. \--Costs incurred by cities and counties should be accurately tracked for future reimbursements. \--School superintendents will be holding daily calls with the Texas Commissioner of Education. Because the elderly are the most at risk, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid have issued very specific new coronavirus guidelines for nursing homes and other settings that care for the elderly. The link to review those can be found CMS guidance for nursing homes. What else can you personally do to help? Pay attention to these published guidelines from the Department of State Health Services (DSHS), which are everyday actions to stop the spread of any respiratory virus, including COVID-19: • Wash hands often for 20 seconds and encourage others to do the same. • If no soap and water are available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. • Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, then throw the tissue away. • Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. • Disinfect surfaces, buttons, handles, knobs, and other places touched often. • Avoid close contact with people who are sick. It is also suggested that we practice "social distancing," which means staying away from other people, avoiding crowds and minimizing physical contact so that you do not spread illness. This means currently avoiding mass gatherings, skipping the usual handshake, and remaining six feet away from others. See the CDC and DSHS websites below for how to prepare your home and help prevent the spread of COVID 19 here and here. Earlier this week, a doctor shared his advice in simple terms: "Do everything your grandmother used to teach you... that means wash your hands; take baths and showers when you come home; don't touch your face; sneeze and cough into your sleeve instead of your hand; wipe down your countertops and door knobs; and practice social distancing." Currently I avoid shaking hands (which is especially difficult for someone in elected office), but instead I’m doing elbow or fist bumps with everyone! My daughter Lois Kate arrived home from a spring break trip to Florida, including an airline flight. This means she is not going to hug her grandmother, Nana, nor is she going to stand within six feel of her. This disciplined hygiene is tough, but necessary and will help to lessen the peak of those infected. It is VERY important! The value of common sense cannot be underestimated. For instance, today President Trump and Governor Abbott both said that there is no plan for the limitation of movement of the general public (quarantine), contrary to some online rumors which have created unwarranted panic buying of food and goods. This is a serious health challenge but I am confident that we are ahead of the curve. Undoubtedly, as more testing is done, we will see more Texans infected with COVID-19. Yet on a brighter note, the vast majority of those infected will have few symptoms, especially younger people. You may recall 10 years ago that the last pandemic was called N1H1 or the "Swine Flu." It was a personal event in my home, as I tested positive for N1H1 in the summer of 2009. In the end, most of those infected along with myself all recovered fully. Because of extreme caution and good hygiene, no one else in my family came down with N1H1 that year. It is a good reminder of how these instances tend to play out. To better understand this, the Swine Flu stats on the can be found here. Last but certainly not least, I would like to mention the power of prayer! I am praying for a cure, for the stop of the spread of this virus and that our nation will unite to defeat this challenge. Strength can be found in our Lord most certainly during challenging times such as these. Like any other natural disasters, we will ultimately triumph and find a way forward in this state. Texans always do. Sincerely, Senator Lois W. Kolkhorst Facebook Twitter Instagram Website update your preferences or unsubscribe from this list. Political Ad.

Hey Alex, My opponent is taking notice of our campaign. They just released an urgent fundraising email, trying their best to do what the Far Right does -- spread lies and fear. And I don't blame them for getting nervous. We are the FIRST Democratic campaign to raise 6-digits in 24 YEARS. They know last time there was such a campaign in our district, the district only barely didn't go blue. The reason we've gotten this far is because of our team of dedicated volunteers and supporters working hard each day to connect with folks from around our district. Meanwhile, my opponent keeps swinging further to the Far Right. From calling to end Roe v. Wade in response to RBG's passing to continually working to enable Trump, she is out of touch. The majority of Texans I've talked with are clear: they want common sense for the common good and an end to inflammatory rhetoric and gridlock Dawn - and Don - use to divide our communities. We have a chance to make some serious gains, we have a chance to break the supermajority in the State Senate, but we need more funds to buy TV and radio ads for our final push. Can you chip in $2.40, $24, or more before our September 30th deadline? Contribute A lot of folks are struggling these days. From the folks in Abilene who were charged $70,000 in healthcare bills to the ranchers in Blanco that had their well-water poisoned by Kinder Morgan, from the family in Kerrville who lost their jobs to the students in Belton who have to go into debt just to receive higher education; many families are having hard conversations at their kitchen tables. Whereas my opponent will attempt to fearmonger, I only speak the truth that their reckless refusal to expand Medicaid and to take money away from our public schools hurts us and our communities. I spend each and every day talking to families about their struggles. My opponent talks only to big fundraisers. Expanding healthcare to all, supporting public schools, protecting our environment, expanding our civil rights, having good-paying jobs; that is how we ensure that everyone can fulfill their dreams. At the end of the day, we all want the same thing: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. That is what I'm fighting to achieve, for all of us. My opponent, meanwhile, is too busy enabling the President who paid only $750 in taxes in 2016. We're preparing for our final push. Can you chip in $2.4, $24, or more before our September 30th deadline? Contribute If you are unable to contribute financially at this time, you can still do so by joining one of our virtual volunteer events. I appreciate you and your support.

Let's finally get the healthcare we deserve! Dear friends, Running for office isn't easy, but one of the great joys of campaigning is making new friends. One of those new friends is Dani Cook, an activist and advocate for healthcare who has been fighting for Tennesseeans' healthcare for years. Today she endorsed me. This is an incredible honor. Healthcare isn't a partisan issue. Our family values, our economy, and our emotional well-being depend on knowing that we have access to medical care. A friend, not long ago, raced to a hospital with her daughter who had fallen. Her little girl was having seizures and was unresponsive. She waited hours in the ER before being told she'd have to be transported to another center 2 HOURS AWAY! There was a closer hospital, but they wouldn't take her there. She still doesn't know why. Fortunately, her little girl is okay, but no parent should have to endure that fear. There are too many stories like this, and I refuse to stand by and watch our communities be deprived of what should be a fundamental right in the richest economy in the world. We can fix this system. We can provide insurance for every citizen. All we need is common sense and real people representing us, because it's clear the politicians, whose healthcare is guaranteed by OUR TAX DOLLARS, are not invested in the problem. I am! My family's well-being depends on my success in Congress. I can't afford to let you down because people I love are counting on me. VOLUNTEER NOW Let's get this done.

These are challenging times for all of us. I am a local restaurant owner facing huge financial losses and a mom with kids doing their best to learn.. Friend - These are challenging times for all of us. I am a local restaurant owner facing huge financial losses and a mom with kids doing their best to learn from home. I am heartbroken by each lost job in our community because I know what it means for the impacted individuals and their families. One thing is for certain -- now isn’t the time for partisan politics or leadership that seeks to divide rather than unite. As your State Representative, I’m focused 100% on serving you -- working to connect Bend residents with government services they need, promoting mitigation efforts to defeat COVID-19, and leading for the safe, gradual reopening of our community -- starting with our hospital and medical professionals. I’m also seeking re-election to keep moderate, independent leadership serving Bend. But the hard-left special interests in Salem have set their sights on defeating me. I am the number one target for defeat. Why? Because I think people and progress are more important than partisan labels. Because I am a pro-choice moderate who also understands that excessive taxation and regulation kills jobs and hurts small businesses. Now isn’t the time for new job-killing taxes and taxes that raise the cost of household necessities. Now is the time for calm heads and common sense -- not rigid ideological agendas. I am fiscally responsible, socially inclusive, environmentally conscious, and politically independent. I work across party lines and reject rigid right-left extremes. I lead by finding common ground for the positive change we need. Friend, I need open-minded people like you who are tired of the political nonsense to join my campaign to ensure that our independent, yet moderate ideas are not just heard, but also executed. I need to know that you’re with me. Will you join me by chipping in $5 now? STAND WITH CHERI HELT CHIP IN $5 NOW Oregon needs more public servants who listen rather than attack, who legislate rather than call names, who reach out to solve problems and get things done. I know that you are sick of politicians who chose polarized politics over doing what’s right for the people they serve. So, why don’t you join me right now, friend? CHIP IN $5 NOW STAND WITH CHERI We deserve more than partisan politics in Oregon. Let’s work together to pave the way forward to a strong and bright future for all of us.

With each week that passes, the race gets tougher and tough Friend, It’s the end of August, meaning we are coming up on the 60-day countdown to the election. With each week that passes, the race gets tougher and tougher – and the most powerful special interests in Salem are preparing to drown out our positive message. Friend, that’s why I’m reaching out to you, specifically. I know I can trust you to stand up for OUR values. Values of common sense, working together and standing up for what is right, regardless of political consequences. The same values that built Bend into the great place it is today. I’m counting on your support as my campaign faces an all-important deadline: the August End of Month deadline. Can I count on you to chip in now? STAND WITH CHERI → As the attacks begin to grow, we must stand strong. While the powerful in Salem push for extreme, fringe positions, we are committed to making meaningful, measurable change that benefits our citizens, families, and small businesses instead of limiting them. These last two months are critical - you’ll decide if the partisans who want to control Salem win, or the people do. Are you with me? YES, I WILL STAND FOR BEND → We need to keep Bend inclusive and independent, not a place where pettiness and extreme partisanship stand bigger than all of us together. We can’t let the Salem elite tell Bend how to vote or what to believe. Please chip in and prevent extremist politics from Salem buy out the Bend we’ve built together. Friend, this race will take all of us. The most powerful in this state are coming for Bend. I truly can't do this alone. Let’s close out this month strong, friend. We can do this.

We'll shine a spotlight on some of our volunteers every week, so you can get inspired, and join along. Peter Kunen I moved to Bend from Portland in 2013 when I got a promotion within the Oregon Department of Revenue to be a tax auditor in the Department's Bend office. I retired in 2018 and I now live with my two small dogs, Henry & Betty. In Bend, I like to hike, both trail and road bike, cross-country ski, and walk my dogs. I have a son in Baltimore, and my daughter lives in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where I have two little grandsons, ages two and a half, and one month. I have campaigned for the Democratic candidate for HD 54 in the last two election cycles and I'm excited that we are finally in a position to win this year! My biggest issue right now is climate change. It's particularly important to me now that I have two grandchildren, who will bear the full brunt of climate change in a way that I will not. I also care about having a well-built safety net including health care for all and access to good education, so that all kids get a good start in life. With the issues that I care about, it's natural that I support Democratic candidates in every election. I've been disgusted by Republican walkouts from the legislature, and I want to help flip Republican-held seats. I think that Jason is a particularly strong candidate and I feel that his views are well aligned with my own. I know he'll do a great job in the legislature, and I look forward to having a representative who we can actually talk to and work with on environmental initiatives. Zandra Brant I am a retired educator and moved to Bend with my husband in 2014. Our son and his family live in Three Rivers. I love to garden with native plants but also tend an area with unusual species. We enjoy traveling, and we both love photography. My top issue is gun violence prevention. I had a good friend who took his life using a firearm and the shock of it propelled me to join Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Because Jason has received the Gun Sense Candidate Distinction from Everytown for Gun Safety, I believe he can be trusted to vote for common sense firearm bills. Volunteering for Jason is enjoyable because he values our planet, wants to keep kids safe from guns, and will work to ensure a better level of stability for Bend’s community.

Friends, If you live in the Lowcountry as we do, you probably appreciate how special a place this is to call home. Perhaps you’re working and raising a family as Carol and I are, or maybe you’ve settled down and are enjoying retirement. Fact is, the Lowcountry is a singular place, filled with friendly people, breathtaking beauty, and unrivaled opportunity. It’s a place that you and I have worked together to preserve and improve and build upon because we realize there’s nowhere like it on this side of Heaven. While we’re facing some new and uncertain challenges these days, we’re facing them together as neighbors, each of us doing our part to stay safe, work hard, and help our family and friends. As one of our neighbors told me yesterday, “Larry, this is what the Lowcountry does best. We pull together, do the next right thing... we just get the job done, always have.” That got me thinking about the record we’re building by all working together, and it’s a pretty impressive record. We’re protecting our unique spaces through land conservation and preservation, and we’re advancing education by offering new and innovative opportunities. We’ve led the Southeast in job creation and economic development, and we’re improving infrastructure, with more ongoing repair and construction today than at any time in our history. And most importantly, we’re safeguarding our God-given rights and liberties while taking common sense steps to strengthen public safety and law and order. In the coming weeks we’ll talk more about these successes and how they can benefit the Lowcountry’s future, and yours. You’ll want to stay tuned in to learn of exciting new projects, including ones not yet publicly announced. And you’ll hear from people who have asked if they could share a few words with you, people who are dearest and closest to me. In the meantime, I hope you and your loved ones are safe and well and enjoying your summer. If I can be of help to you, please contact me at [[URL REDACTED]] Sincerely, State Senator Larry Grooms WEBSITE | FACEBOOK | DONATE PAID FOR BY LARRY GROOMS FOR SENATE Edit your subscription | Unsubscribe

Friends - As we’re campaigning across Berkeley and Charleston, folks most often ask two things — how my wife Carol and our three boys are doing, and how I caught the ‘political bug’. I’m as proud as I can be to tell them about our family, and I believe public service is a worthwhile calling. So, I thought you might be interested in our story. Carol and I met while we were at Clemson. It took a little longer for her, but for me, it only took a few hours after our first hello to know that she was the one. That same day, she laughed and laughed after I told her that I was going to marry her. Three years later, at College Street Baptist Church in Walhalla she was saying, “I do”. As a young married couple, Carol became a classroom teacher while I worked in finance. Soon we decided to use what savings we had to build a small convenience store. We ran it ourselves, put in long hours, and the business began to grow. After a time, we were able to open other stores. We’ve always been active in our church and community, and we started looking for other ways to give back. Carol cared for our growing family and began doing volunteer work. Public service seemed a good fit for me and I decided to run for state senate. Looking back, I realize the campaign was about the same things that still matter most today — common sense, Lowcountry values, and family safety. This past May, Carol and I celebrated our 32nd anniversary. She is an incredible wife, and loving mother to our boys. Our oldest, Taylor, is an attorney in Charleston. He is a professional through and through and he has a competitive spirit that drives him to try to win every argument. Our middle son, Hayden graduated from USC School of Law and recently took the bar exam. The most free-spirited of the boys, he just purchased a home on James Island and will be moving furniture this weekend. Our baby boy, Jack is now 21. He is a hard worker and will graduate early from Clemson in December. He is his mother’s child. He has her wit, compassion, and love of music. So that’s the story of us. I ask for your help and I hope you’ll join us in this campaign for common sense. Check out our Facebook page and sign up on the website. Most of all, know that you can call on me if I can be of help.

October 23, 2020 Capital Region Legislators Announce Legislation to Cap Delivery Fees from Third Party Delivery Apps Troy, NY – Assemblymembers John T. McDonald III, Patricia Fahy, and Carrie Woerner called for the oversight of Third-Party Delivery App companies UberEats, DoorDash, and GrubHub after numerous restaurants have spoken about the issues they have had with these companies over the course of the pandemic. Despite restaurants’ reliance on these companies to provide delivery services which have increased dramatically due to COVID-19, companies have charged restaurants fees upwards of 30%. Legislation announced today will cap those fees at 15% relieving restaurants of this financial burden. Members also sent a letter to the CEO’s of UberEats, DoorDash, and GrubHub earlier this week detailing complaints of restauranteurs and solutions to addressing these problems. In addition to unconscionably high fees, restaurants have had menus posted online without their knowledge, and orders picked up by delivery drivers that never reach the consumer. Assemblymembers called for enacting contracts be in place prior to a third party delivery app being listed as a restaurant on that app, and placing onus on the third party delivery app if a consumer does not receive their order rather than charging the restaurant with any financial responsibility. Assemblymember John T. McDonald III said, “Our local restaurants are small businesses that serve our communities in so many ways. Restaurants provide jobs, a place for people to come together, and have stepped up to provide resources and food to people during the pandemic even as they struggle to stay open. Third party delivery apps must level the playing field and I support common sense measures to address the problems that restaurants have faced when working with these companies and the misleading actions by third party delivery app companies even when restaurants actively avoid utilizing their services.” "Main Street continues to be hit the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic and our small businesses are in dire need of relief," said Assemblymember Patricia Fahy. "Following discussions with local restaurant owners from around the Capital Region in conjunction with Assemblymembers John McDonald and Carrie Woerner, today we are introducing state legislation to cap delivery and other fees levied by third-party mobile applications to provide greater financial flexibility for these local businesses. Up to ninety-percent of restaurants in New York City could not afford to pay September's rent in full -- and given the federal government's continued inaction on real relief to help the economy recover, small restaurants across the state need help -- and fast." Assemblywoman Carrie Woerner said, “I have spoken with countless restauranteurs who have been on the front lines, changing their business model to primarily takeout and delivery services so their doors can remain open. At the same time, third party delivery apps continue to charge extraordinary fees to restaurants, along with disruptive policies that make it harder for restaurants to survive. It is past time we address these issues and pass legislation regulating the fees these companies can charge and get these essential businesses the help they need to continue serving This email was sent to [[EMAIL_REDACTED]] why did I get this? unsubscribe from this list update subscription preferences John McDonald for Assembly · 10 Roosevelt Blvd · Cohoes, NY 12047-4013 · USA

This is a huge week for our campaign and we are truly feeling the love and support from everyone who voted, donated, volunteered or got involved to power us through the primary! View in browser Alex, This is a huge week for our campaign and we are truly feeling the love and support from everyone who voted, donated, volunteered or got involved to power us through the primary! The record number of votes we received shows that Idahoans are ready to act. They're very excited about this historic campaign, our message of people-first politics and a return to moral, ethical leadership in the U.S. Senate. They’re ready for a new generation of leadership driven by a willingness to address, champion and act. And we must act now. The Huffington Post covered our record-breaking primary win and stated this about Senator Risch: He has voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act numerous times and regularly opposes LGBTQ rights and women’s reproductive rights. He is insanely rich. He does not believe that human activity is a significant contributor to climate change, which is well-established science. These truths begin to tell the story. The story of why we can’t afford to lose any ground in our fight to DEFEAT Jim Risch and win this senate seat. It is time for enablers of division like Jim Risch to leave the stage. And it is up to us to make that happen. Can you help me make sure that Idaho’s next senator is someone that cares about the people? Click on an option below to get started.

We are at a moment in our country’s history where we need to heal and unify. That is where I will spend my energy. Our country needs moral and common sense leadership and I am running for the U.S. Senate to provide the leadership our state deserves. I am overwhelmed by the messages of support, the new volunteers signing up daily, and a slow but highly anticipated return to in-person events. I can’t wait to connect with you, hear your stories, and talk about a future for Idaho that is powered by and works for the people.

Make sure you and your friends and family are registered to vote here: Check your voter registration We have 22 days until Election Day but Oregonians are starting to vote next week. The person who is elected to represent House District 37 on November 3rd needs to reflect our values. There is so much at stake, right here at home. My opponent believes that businesses should be able to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people when hiring and firing. She is opposed to the climate legislation we desperately need to secure a safe, healthy future for generations to come. After decades of disinvestment and neglect, she wants to gut funding to our K-12 school and she opposes the common sense legislation we need to make sure every Oregonian is safe from gun violence. It’s all on the ballot in this hard-fought race and I need your help to tackle these issues with compassion and data-driven policies. We need $2,000 more to reach our campaign-wide goal.

Last session, the legislature refused to hear a bill protecting survivors of sexual assault. That's unacceptable. View this email in your browser This last legislative session, Rep. Melissa Wintrow proposed a bill that would allow survivors of sexual assault to obtain a civil protection order, or restraining order, against their perpetrators, without an existing criminal investigation or preexisting intimate relationship. This bill seems like common sense—if someone is being threatened, they should be able to get protection. This bill would have allowed those victims to the same protection orders as those that have experienced domestic violence, unlike right now, where it is very difficult for these victims to get a protection order. Even more importantly, the victim could have explained their case to a judge without the alleged perpetrator present. Due to lobbying by the NRA, the bill didn’t even get a hearing in committee. One in 3 women and 1 in 6 men will experience some form of sexual assault during their life. The Idaho rate of forced sexual intercourse is significantly higher than the US rate. The overall rate in the US is 10.3% for women and 3% for men. Compare that to Idaho, with 15% for women and 4% for men. Minorities experience even higher numbers: almost 50% of multiracial women and over 45% of Native American women are subjected to sexual assault in their life. Most of these cases are between two people where the victim does not have a preexisting intimate relationship with the perpetrator nor a preexisting criminal case, two things that Wintrow’s bill specifically highlighted that a victim wouldn’t need for a protection order. Despite having no mention of guns or gun usage anywhere in its language, the proposed legislation died because of the perceived threat to gun rights. Today these victims of sexual violence remain unprotected. Domestic violence statistics are no better. On a single day in Idaho, 514 people are victims of domestic violence. Cases get even worse in rural communities: women in small towns are 27% more likely to be abused than women in big cities and 42% are more likely than women from the suburbs. In a district dominated by rural communities, we need to be cognizant of the violence that might be happening around us. COVID-19 has increased family violence cases in the US. Substance abuse, financial strain, and social isolation are common domestic abuse risk factors and with increased unemployment rates and social distancing, those factors have been on the rise. Even before the pandemic, intimate partner violence rates remain the highest in the poorest neighborhoods. Increased stress levels among parents leave children more vulnerable to abuse and neglect as well. Abusive crimes are generally underreported. But with the right protections and processes in place, victims have a better chance of coming forward and speaking up. It saddens me to hear these statistics and to know that so many in the legislature are unwilling to do anything about them. However, knowing what’s happening is the first step in advocating for survivors. In the legislature, I will do everything in my power to help those that experience abuse of any kind to have the resources and protections that they need. I will fight hard to pass legislation like that proposed by Representative Wintrow. We need to be good to each other and help those around us. Let’s not ignore the safety our neighbors. Together, let’s do something about it. I need to your help! I know we can win this race, but I can't do it alone. I'll need a great team of people by my side.

Why is paid leave so important? Well, it’s pretty simple - it keeps us healthy! Hi Alex, Why is paid leave so important? Well, it’s pretty simple - it keeps us healthy! When people can’t access paid time off from work, they’re more likely to discount their health in favor of their job. That means going to work when they are sick. Working when we are sick makes it harder for us to recover, so you stay sicker for longer. It also means putting our coworkers at risk, too. Putting our health on the backburner also means we’re more likely to wind up with more serious illnesses that land us in the emergency room. And nobody wants that. Not you, not your loved ones, and not even taxpayers. Really - emergency room visits cost taxpayers more money than primary and even secondary care! People who can take time off of work are less likely to stay sick, they’re less likely to get their coworkers or their families sick, and they’re less likely to end up with serious illnesses and an emergency room visit. All of these individual and community benefits translate into saved dollars and cents for businesses. Paid medical leave would save tens of millions for both businesses and the government through lower healthcare costs and higher productivity. I don’t know about you - but that feels like common sense to me! If real benefits for working families feel like common sense to you, will you chip in $3 right now? I can’t do this alone, and I really need your help.

# When I decided to run for Senate, I knew it would be an uphill climb, Alex. The corporate special interests who have captured Washington for too long will spend any amount of money to keep their grip on power. And since I got into this race, that's exactly what they've done — to the tune of over $26 million on attack ads here in Montana. In my time as Montana's Governor, we've been able to look past the partisan food fights to bring people from across the state together around issues that matter to all of us. We've worked with Republicans and Democrats alike to expand affordable health care, protect our public lands and outdoor spaces, and pass one of the strongest campaign finance laws in the country. That kind of common sense is exactly what scares the big corporate interests into opening their wallets. They're spending big to stop us from bringing Montana values to Washington. We have just one week until our August fundraising deadline and our campaign isn't taking any money from corporate PACs. Instead, we're counting on contributions from people like you to reach our goal. Will you make a donation today to help? If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $10 now Chip in $25 now Chip in $50 now Chip in $100 now Chip in $250 now Another Amount Washington is a place where talking about something has become a substitute for doing something.

I'm running for Senate to change that and make real progress on the issues that matter to all of us — just like we've done here in Montana. Thank you for making this campaign possible.

# Alex, Right now, a bunch of Washington-based groups are pouring millions into Montana. They're running attack ads about my record that, to put it plainly, are just flat-out false. Here's the truth: As Governor, I've worked with Republicans and Democrats alike to get things done for all Montanans. We have expanded affordable health care, protected our public lands, and passed one of the strongest campaign finance laws in the country. If you can, consider donating to our campaign before tonight's important end-of-month deadline to help us overcome these attacks and win this race: If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $10 now Chip in $25 now Chip in $50 now Chip in $100 now Chip in $250 now Another Amount The thing is, working across party lines always just seemed like common sense to me. Why wouldn't we work with anyone and everyone who is interested in improving people's lives? But that's not how Washington works these days. Instead, it runs on big corporate interests and dark money. And these groups will spend whatever it takes to keep the wheels churning in their favor. I'm running for Senate to get big money out of our politics and bring a common-sense attitude to Washington. And with all this outside money pouring in, we're counting on donations from folks like you to win. That's why I'm asking: Will you pitch in whatever you can ahead of tonight's end-of-month deadline? We'll put your contribution to work right away building a winning campaign: If you've saved your payment information with ActBlue Express, your donation will go through immediately: Chip in $10 now Chip in $25 now Chip in $50 now Chip in $100 now Chip in $250 now Another Amount In this election, we have an opportunity to make a real difference in people's lives both here in Montana and across the country.

Finished for the year... ## Friend, The Tennessee General Assembly has finally adjourned after a tough legislative session... Here are some updates from the final days. Tennessee General Assembly passes $39.45 billion budget Last week in Nashville, both the House and Senate approved a $39.45 billion budget that addresses the unexpected revenue shortfalls caused by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic in Tennessee. C:\\Users\\hms061\\Downloads\\[[URL REDACTED]] The Fiscal Year (FY) 2020-2021 budget reduces the size of government through common sense reductions and cuts totaling $1.5 billion over a two-year period in efforts to address historic revenue losses. The budget finalizes the elimination of the Hall Income Tax and does not raise taxes on Tennesseans. The new state spending plan invests $350 million into Tennessee’s savings account (Rainy Day Fund), bringing the total to $1.45 billion. The budget also fully funds the Basic Education Program (BEP), covering both growth and inflation with a $50.3 million investment. It includes $10.6 million for health insurance and retirement for teachers and principals. The FY 2020-2021 budget supports higher education with a $50 million investment in new facilities. The budget also focuses on boosting consumer and business confidence through the creation of a $25 million sales tax holiday, which will take place over two weekends in late July and early August 2020. Other key allocations include a $210 million grant program for all Tennessee cities and counties. These funds have no restrictions and will be used to address unique needs that are best determined by local and county leaders. Approximately $15 million will be used to support economic and community development through broadband accessibility grants. Finally, the FY 2020-2021 budget invests $19 million to strengthen the state’s health care safety network and $7.5 million in new funding will create a children’s behavioral safety network. Tennessee’s new budget supports citizens across all three grand divisions of our state as they continue to recover from these extraordinary circumstances. Under conservative leadership, the Volunteer State will remain the best place in the entire nation to live, work, raise a family, and retire. Republican lawmakers pass historic pro-life legislation Republican lawmakers last week also passed historic pro-life legislation that bans abortion procedures after a fetal heartbeat is detected or around six weeks. House Bill 2263 passed by a 68-17 vote tally Thursday morning. The legislation includes a ladder provision that enacts bans at various other gestation intervals up to 24 weeks. These provisions would take effect if the courts struck down the six-week ban or any other component of this measure. House Bill 2263 requires doctors to conduct an ultrasound, show images to an expectant mother and inform her about her baby’s development. An amendment added to the bill also requires abortion facilities where 50 or more procedures are performed a year to post signage informing patients their chemical abortion procedure is reversible. Patients would also receive the same notification prior to and after the first dose of a two dose abortion-inducing drug treatment has been administered. C:\\Users\\hms061\\Downloads\\DSC_2490.JPGTennessee is a strong pro-life state, and this historic measure and others demonstrate our continued commitment to fight for our unborn. House approves Right to Work constitutional amendment House Republicans also approved a resolution adding Tennessee’s Right to Work law to the state constitution.C:\\Users\\hms061\\Downloads\\[[URL REDACTED]] The resolution must pass by a two-thirds majority during the 2021 or 2022 legislative sessions in order to appear on the ballot for a statewide referendum in November 2022. The Right to Work constitutional amendment would also become part of the state constitution if adopted by a majority vote during the 2022 election cycle. Tennessee’s Right to Work statute has been state law since 1947. It stipulates workers cannot be hired or fired based on their membership in, affiliation with, resignation from, or refusal to join or affiliate with any labor union or employee organization. When it was introduced in 1947, supporters of the bill argued it would “be of great advantage to the average member of organized labor.” Right to Work also protects the rights of those who choose not to join a union. Twenty-seven states have Right to Work laws, and nine of those have passed constitutional amendments, including neighboring states Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama. The Alabama amendment passed most recently in 2016. Another neighbor, Virginia, is presently considering repealing its Right to Work statute. A constitutional amendment would offer greater protection for workers against such repeal efforts. House Republicans remain committed to support Tennessee’s workers and businesses. Republican leaders pass drug-free zone reform House Republicans also passed legislation reforming drug-free zone laws currently on the books. House Bill 2517 passed by an 88-4 vote on June 17, 2020. The measure right-sizes drug-free zones from 1,000 feet to 500 feet and strengthens penalties against those who sell drugs to children within these zones. At the same time, the legislation allows for a judge to use discretion and apply more appropriate sentencing in certain instances. C:\\Users\\hms061\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache\\[[URL REDACTED]]\\[[URL REDACTED]] Drug-free zones include public or private elementary, middle, secondary schools, child care agencies public libraries, recreational centers and parks. By shrinking these zones, House Bill 2517 has the potential to create additional resources to make justice more efficient in our state. House Bill 2517 now heads the governor’s desk for his signature. Some additional pieces of legislation I passed during the final week of the 111th General Assembly includes: * HB2914 which, subject to local approval, specifies that the General Sessions Court Clerk must serve as the Clerk of the Juvenile Court of Dickson County rather than the County Clerk. This legislation passed the House Floor with a majority vote. * HB2278 which seeks to promote tourism in Hickman County. This bill passed both the House and Senate floor yesterday evening and only awaits the Governor’s signature.

Last month the Oregon Department of Education announced their guidelines for schools to reopen this fall. Anna Kasachev for State Representative Alex, Let's talk about education. Last month the Oregon Department of Education announced their guidelines for schools to reopen this fall. School districts were required to come up with their plans to follow state requirements. These have since been updated and will likely continue to change in the next couple months. As I've been watching this play out and talking with people in our communities I have seen several serious concerns: 1. The communities in my district (ranging from North Salem to Woodburn) are some of the poorest in Oregon. I'm concerned our schools will not be able to comply with the cookie-cutter restrictions from the state. 2. Teachers may be overburdened attempting to follow all the restrictions. 3. The cost of implementing these restrictions is likely to fall on the shoulders of our local schools once again. 4. If our local schools are not able to provide sufficient in-person education, parents will have to choose between several difficult options--such as finding childcare for online learning or paying for a private education. Governor Brown and Rep. Teresa Alonso-Leon have left our students and teachers behind for far too long. These 'guidelines' to reopen this school year are yet another example of this. They should find a better balance between protecting children from COVID-19 (so far thankfully, no one in Oregon under 50 has died from it) and protecting their need for a good education. Our children must have the option to be in the classroom this coming year. Working families cannot afford to take time off of work to watch their kids during the day. And many kids will not be able to learn as well without the physical, mental, social, and emotional aspects of in-person learning. It's time for Governor Brown and Rep. Alonso-Leon to start working for students, families and teachers instead of against them. As your next representative, I'll always put our students first! Politicians in the legislature think that they know what's best for your kids. When I am elected, I want to give control back to our teachers and parents, but I can't do that without your support! Please help me bring common sense back to the Legislature by donating today! Help us raise $1,000! # Double Your Donation! If you are looking for a way to help my campaign I have good news!

Governor Brown has called the Legislature into a special session this Wednesday. Boomer Wright logo Alex, Governor Brown has called the Oregon Legislature back to Salem for a Special Session on Wednesday. The goal is to address Coronavirus relief and police reform. Make no mistake: these are important issues that the legislature needs to address to help struggling Oregonians. However, I am concerned that the list of proposals doesn't include anything to address the $2.7 billion budget shortfall the state is currently facing. There's also reason to be concerned if the public will not be allowed into the capitol building during the special session. Our elected leaders need to address the waste and lack of accountability in state government. The best thing we can do for our families and local business owners right now is get state government out of the way so they can provide for themselves, their employees and communities again. Whether they let me in or not, I plan to show up at the capitol this week to speak out for our Coastal communities! ## Another Fundraising Match Opportunity If you missed the last donation drive you have another opportunity! Our previous $5,000 match went so well that another generous donor has offered to match all contributions until July 15th up to $5,000!

It's time to get Oregonians working again. We can do it carefully and cautiously, but it has to start happening now. Boomer Wright logo Alex, It's time to get Oregonians working again. We can do this. We can do it carefully and cautiously, but it has to start happening now. Most of Oregon, including the Oregon Coast, is in Phase One of Kate Brown's reopening plan. While that's a step in the right direction, some of her decisions lack common sense and are killing jobs. The continued closure of bowling centers is an example. North Bend Lanes has been operating for decades. The owner, Mark Mattecheck, has been able to open the adjoining restaurant, so why can't customers bowl in the same building? Mark was asked by Governor Brown to submit suggestions for guidelines to reopen bowling centers in Phase One. At the last minute, plans changed and they were forced to stay closed. If our government won't stand up for local small businesses, we need to! So here is what I'm working on: * This week I put out a press release calling for answers from Kate Brown on this confusing situation. * The World has picked up the story. You can read their article here. It looks like KCBY and KDOCK are working on reports as well. * I've also started a Facebook petition to Kate Brown asking her to reopen bowling centers. So far over 380 people have signed! You can add your name here. * Publicity is great, but people aren't working and we risk the businesses never reopening. So that's why I put together a "Buycott" at North Bend Lanes for tomorrow (Saturday). I'm asking you to join me in supporting Mark's restaurant by ordering takeout or dining in and help this great local business. You can find details on my Facebook event here. As of right now, over 80 people are planning to attend! * If you can't come tomorrow, you can still reserve an hour of bowl time at North Bend Lanes, or schedule a curbside pickup for a bottle of wine! Thank you as always for reading. I hope to see you tomorrow! Sincerely, P.O. Box 39000 Florence, OR 97439 You are receiving this email because you are a supporter. Preferences | Unsubscribe

When my wife passed away of cancer our community stood up for our family. Now I want to stand up for you! Boomer Wright logo Alex, When my wife passed away of cancer our community stood up for our family. Now I would like the opportunity to stand up for my community by representing them in Salem. Watch my new ad below that my team put together that tells the whole story. New: ad I want to stand for you! ## More Endorsements Are In!

Small business owners are the backbone of our communities and I am proud to represent their voice in Salem. OSBA endorsement I've also recently received the Associated Oregon Loggers endorsement. I worked my way through college by working at lumber and plywood mills. I know that our forestry, farming, manufacturing and fishing industries are essential to our coastal communities and must be protected. I am honored to represent Oregon loggers when I get to Salem! Associated Oregon Loggers ## Grassroots Support Campaigns like mine are very expensive--sometimes as much as $1,000,000 is needed to win a legislative race.

The Special Session failed to hold Governor Brown accountable for our state's failure Boomer Wright logo Alex, Two weeks ago, I visited Salem to see what was going on during the Special Session. Unfortunately, the building was closed to the public, which meant no transparency for taxpayers. I wanted to see for myself if the Legislature was going to hold Governor Brown and the Oregon Employment Department accountable for their failures. But without public input, what do you think happened? ## Special Session: Failed I am disappointed that the Legislature refused to hold our state government accountable for failing to help Oregonians when we needed it the most. Our neighbors on the coast are struggling to put food on the table and pay their bills because they have not received their unemployment checks. Few in Salem seems interested in finding a solution. That's why I'm committed to bringing common sense solutions to Salem! Click the picture to watch what I had to say when I visited the capitol: Boomer Wright at the Capitol ## Grassroots Fundraising Challenge A strong campaign is powered by grassroots support, not special interests. But for better or worse, elections aren't cheap. That's why I need grassroots support from friends and neighbors like you! Will you help me bring coastal common sense back to Salem by making a $50, $100, or $250 donation today? Now is the perfect opportunity to donate because #TimberUnity has announced that if I outraise my opponent in July, they will make a $1,000 contribution to my campaign!

I chat with Otsego County Representative Michele Farwell about restoration efforts in her district 🎶 Pulling Mussels from the Shell 🎶 This week, I had a great chat with Otsego County Representative Michele Farwell about efforts to restore a healthy eel and mussel population in the Butternut Creek. It's a very cool project, with many parts, and it really underscores that all things in the natural world are interconnected, including we humans. And yet, despite our interconnections and commonalities, we seem to have a lot of trouble agreeing on some very basic principles; all people should be treated fairly and equitably, our public institutions need to be accountable to the public, and we will not tolerate racism. I was very glad to hear that Assemblyman Miller is healthy enough to be back in the Assembly voting on legislation. My concern for his well-being is beyond politics. He's a dad and a husband, and a nice guy. And that's why I was truly disappointed that he voted against all of the police reform bills which are common sense measures to address racial profiling, curtail police brutality, and bring much-needed accountability to policing in New York State. Fighting racism in our society and in our institutions should not be a partisan political fight, it should be an American fight. We are all interconnected. Let's never forget that.

Alex, Georgia leadership needs to do better for you and your family. Georgia has the highest per capita infection rate in the country. And now, Governor Brian Kemp has banned local governments from mandating masks. While everyone, everywhere is struggling, the extremity of the crisis here is largely of our own making. You deserve leaders who will step up and do what's right in the most difficult of moments. I believe in putting our families, children, teachers, and essential workers ahead of partisanship. I believe in common sense and listening to the advice of public health experts. If you stand with me on these basic — yet somehow rare — affirmations, then I need your support. Can I count on you to support me in this fight to better safegaurd public health? Chip in today if you want an elected representative who will work to get us through this faster and stronger. Please do everything you can to keep yourself and others safe, including wearing a mask in public and staying at home as much as possible.

Indiana's Superintendent of Public Instruction endorses Fady for Senate District 30 View this email in your browser BREAKING NEWS Fady for Indiana, the campaign to elect Fady Qaddoura, PhD to represent Indiana Senate District 30, today announced Dr. Jennifer McCormick, Indiana’s Superintendent of Public Instruction, officially endorses Fady and his campaign to serve as the next state senator for Indiana Senate District 30. McCormick’s endorsement comes as education remains the top issue for many Hoosier families and voters across the senate district -- specifically their support for a school funding formula that’s fair for all public schools and a much-deserved pay raise for Indiana’s hardworking educators. “Fady Qaddoura represents the kind of honest leadership Hoosiers not only wish for but value in their statehouse. Specifically, Fady’s immediate response to last month’s school funding controversy was the kind of common sense, children-first approach our families want to see in our elected leaders,” said Dr. Jennifer McCormick, Indiana’s Superintendent of Public Instruction. “Further, I’ve been impressed with Fady’s priority to hand the mic to the voices and leaders that know education policies best: our teachers, parents, and administrators. Hoosiers need that kind of genuine honesty in their elected officials, and I couldn’t be more thrilled to endorse Fady Qaddoura and his campaign for Senate District 30.” “It’s an honor for Dr. McCormick to have faith in the kind of grassroots, education-first campaign I have been running in Senate District 30, and I am humbled to receive this endorsement,” said Fady Qaddoura, PhD and Democratic candidate for Senate District 30. “Throughout her tenure as Indiana’s top school superintendent, Dr. McCormick has remained focused on putting our kids and educators above the political rhetoric too many Hoosiers have grown tired of hearing at the Statehouse. Her endorsement is the kind of bipartisan coalition I am working tirelessly to build in this campaign, because for me, it’s never about a Party’s agenda -- it’s about a Hoosier agenda. That’s what I’ll bring to the state senate when I’m elected in November.” Dr. McCormick’s endorsement of Fady Qaddoura’s campaign comes as Indiana’s school system has perennially remained in the crosshairs at the Indiana General Assembly. Both McCormick and Fady attended last November’s rally at the statehouse where educators called for a respectable pay for the careers they enjoy: teaching our children and helping them build better futures for themselves. Fady and Dr. McCormick were also quick to condemn a letter sent by Indiana Senate Republican Leadership that informed school districts they could lose full funding provided by the state should they choose to spend less than fifty-percent of their time in virtual learning -- even during the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s this kind of bipartisan coalition that stands in contrast to a majority of elected officials in the Republican supermajority, including Fady’s opponent, who have time and again voted against fully funding Indiana’s schools and against doing the right thing by providing educators with a well-earned pay raise.

Our right to vote is only safe when we defend it, and we need your help to make voting by mail the reality for even more Georgia voters.

Gregory Coll, your Republican candidate for the House of Representatives from Maryland Congressional District 8, is your intelligent, sensib Can't See This Message? View in a browser Gregory Coll, Republican Candidate from Maryland Congressional District 8 on The Covid-19 Pandemic Gregory Coll, your Republican candidate for the House of Representatives from Maryland Congressional District 8, is your intelligent, sensible man of the hour when it comes to decisions regarding crises. Today we will discuss the Covid-19 pandemic. When a crisis hits, such as the current health threatening pandemic, there are many uncertainties, many unknowns; and it is impossible to predict many of the when’s, where’s and how’s of solutions may be found. As we all are facing these challenges we must avoid operating on the basis of biased politics, and we must seek the most rational courses of action. Gregory Coll, if elected, will bring the voice of reason to issues such as this. For the present day, let us take what we know: wearing masks and social distancing do work to help reduce the spread of the virus. While wearing them may be inconvenient, if implemented, will help to make the pandemic more temporary and shorter lived. In general terms: it reduces your personal risk as well as that of others. We have seen that not wearing masks, and crowding in places like bars and beaches, tends to lead to increased cases. Therefore, it only makes sense to avoid crowds and keep up recommended social distancing. Areas where there have been more venues available for crowding and lack of social distancing precautions, have seen increased cases. We should look at the proposed limiting of large gatherings as temporary inconveniences in order to preserve the health and lives of many who may be affected. We know that most individuals want to and need to return to work if they are currently unemployed. Gregory Coll supports continued supplemented unemployed benefits for those who cannot do so. On the other hand, Gregory supports appropriate re-opening of businesses as soon as feasibly safely possible. This entails many different scenarios: Places of business that can reasonably arrange for employees to work at home whether full-time or part-time should continue to do so, resulting in social distancing without altering the physical workplaces. This arrangement might result in monetary savings for employers who could potentially reduce need for space, equipment, etc. It involves less risk of exposure to the virus of many. For those jobs that require on-site attendance full-time, appropriate measures should be taken: frequent and thorough sanitizing; protective gear for employees as needed, and social distancing as much as possible. Employees’ concerns regarding their safety should be addressed pro-actively and on-going. Many businesses have become creative about offering services to improve clients’ safety, including limiting indoor capacity, setting up physical barriers, frequent sanitizing, etc. Ultimately, we expect that vaccines and prescriptive cures for the virus will be developed. This cannot come soon enough. However, it does point to the future that this, like many infectious diseases preceding it, will not be in pandemic mode forever. Further, a one-size-fits-all solution is not sensible or reasonable. The virus seems to have peaked and ebbed in various locations. Therefore, we should be flexible with lessening restrictions when the virus recedes, and sadly but necessarily, increasing them when there are increasing numbers. If elected, Gregory Coll will be constantly monitoring the statistics as well as available resources, in order to make intelligent recommendations to the national government regarding things such as stimulus packages, tax modifications, general health and prevention guidance, and common sense overall advice. He will resist pressure to tag on other politicians’ wish lists to needed legislation. Please vote Gregory Coll, Representative in Congress District 8. About Gregory Coll: Gregory Coll, rocket scientist, businessman, family man married with three children, is the Republican candidate for Maryland Congressional District 8.

On my birthday... To All My Friends, in District 83 and Beyond, I’ve been working on Democratic campaigns in Shelby County for a long time. (No wisecracks from anyone—Diane makes plenty of them at home.) I’ve seen candidates come and go, some more memorable than others. Some have come very close to winning their races, while some campaigns were more quixotic. Jerri Green is different. Many of you may be tired of hearing me wax poetic about how I think Jerri is the real deal, but that is truly the best way to put it. She is genuine, honest, down to earth, smart, kind, and has the best interests of District 83 at heart. She is the complete opposite of what the Republicans in Tennessee keep sending to the State House. She will bring compassion and common sense to Nashville. My birthday is August 29. For my birthday, I would like nothing more than your help in doing the good work that Jerri has begun.  The national news has finally caught on to what we in Tennessee have been seeing for years—a supermajority Republican legislature propping up a reactionary Republican governor, bent on stripping Tennesseans of their civil rights. Just last week, Governor Lee signed the bill that will criminalize peaceful protest outside the State Capitol. Jerri’s opponent in this race does nothing more than toe the party line in these votes. It is more important than ever that we flip districts red to blue and break up that supermajority. Our voices need to be heard so this insanity can end. Instead of birthday cards or presents, please consider donating $20.20 for 2020; $29.00 for the 29th (my special day!); $66.00 (the number of days between August 29 and November 3); or any amount of your choosing (go for it!). I am always humbled to have such wonderful and supportive friends. Again, we are in a tight race and every dollar counts. Getting out the vote is key and it costs money. I am so honored I can count on you to help our cause. Stay safe and healthy, and may we all be able to celebrate my birthday in person next year with the new State House Representative for District 83, Jerri Green!

It is clear from the nightly news that people are clamoring for change, a change in leadership particularly. Friend, I wanted to make sure you got Jerri's email on Thursday. This race is tightening everyday. Her opponent is running scared and now is our time to give Jerri that extra boost the campaign needs as summer starts. Thanks to matching dollars we can turn $2500 into $5000 for the campaign, and we are already over half way there! Donate what you can today to help ensure we elect Jerri in November and send One Tough Mother to represent us in Nashville. \- Dave Cambron \---------- Forwarded message --------- From: Jerri Green <[[URL REDACTED]]> Date: Thu, Jun 4, 2020 at 1:01 PM Subject: People are taking notice of our campaign…including my opponent To: Alex Brown <[[EMAIL_REDACTED]]> It is clear from the nightly news that people are clamoring for change, a change in leadership particularly. Whether it is because of the terrible mishandling of the pandemic response or the racial and socioeconomic systemic injustices going unaddressed, those who currently hold power are losing support. And campaigns like ours are gaining momentum. Because people have hope that if their elected representatives were guided by compassion and common sense there wouldn’t be such overwhelming unrest, daily confusion, and collective heartbreak in our communities. People are looking for new leaders, better leaders. And they deserve them. However, those in power won’t go away without a fight. My opponent, Rep. Mark White, recently sent an email to his supporters alerting them that he would have stiff opposition this time, and it would take a vigorous effort for him to hold on to his seat. They see us. They see the army of hard working volunteers hand writing thousands of postcards, making hundreds of phone calls, and amplifying our message on social media daily – all to reach voters, flip this seat in November, and break up the strangle-hold of the GOP supermajority in our state. That’s why 10 year incumbent Mr. White is asking his donors to give hundreds, even thousands of dollars to fight against our grassroots campaign; to try to defeat me – a mom who is simply trying to make the future better for her kids. Maybe that is why they are so scared. Everyone knows no one fights harder than a mama bear protecting her cubs. But I’m not scared. Because I know I can count on you to help me fight back. Now that he and others have taken notice, it is important we don’t back down. That’s why I’m asking you to give what you can to help us fight against the war chest he and the well-funded Tennessee GOP are building. And in the next 48 hours the first $2,500 we receive in donations will be matched!! Can you help us turn $2,500 into $5,000? They will certainly take notice of that. No matter what your donation, I am always humbled and thankful for your support, because no donation is too small to help us in this fight for a better future for our families and our communities. Together we can do it. We must Keep safe and keep making your voice heard, Jerri Green #OneToughMother P.S.

Seriously, this is unbelievable… Friends, The dog days of summer are upon us. It’s hot. It’s humid. It feels impossible to move, to put one foot in front of the other, to breathe the thick soupy air outside (especially through masks, which we wear—of course—to keep ourselves and our neighbors and families safe). But here at Team One Tough Mother, focused we remain. Focused on our singular goal: flipping District 83 from red to blue, and bringing our message of common sense and compassion to Nashville. There are 103 days from now until Tuesday, November 3, 2020. We are so very, very close to this final stretch. The dog days of summer... So, to keep you on task, here are some helpful reminders, dates, and information: * Tennessee’s PRIMARY ELECTION is Thursday, August 6.  If you plan to vote on election day in person, to locate your polling location (and to ensure it will be open), click here. * EARLY VOTING in Shelby County has begun! Early voting in Shelby County runs from July 17 to August 1. You may vote at any one of the 26 early voting sites prior to the August 6 election date and possibly avoid long lines. (No guarantees, but you have multiple options and locations to try!) You can find the early voting locations and hours at the Shelby County Election Commission website here: Click Here. * ABSENTEE VOTING is available for this primary if you will be outside Shelby County on election day; if you will be a full time student outside Shelby County on election day; you reside in a nursing home or assisted living facility; you have jury duty; you are sixty (60) years of age or older; you have a physical disability and an inaccessible polling place; you are hospitalized, ill, disabled, and/or you have determined it is impossible or unreasonable to vote in-person due to the COVID-19 situation; you are a caretaker for someone who is ill; you are observing a religious holiday; you are a member of the military overseas. You must request your absentee ballot NO FEWER THAN SEVEN (7) DAYS prior to the election. (Request by Thursday, July 30.) To request your ballot: Click Here. **Note, this request is ONLY good for this PRIMARY election. If you want to vote absentee in the GENERAL election in November, you will need to go through this process again. You must return your ballot in sufficient time so that it may be counted by 7 PM on Election Day. Ballots may be sent by mail, FedEx, UPS, or courier service. (We recommend using a service that can ensure timely delivery like FedEx or UPS.) You may not hand deliver your ballot. For more on absentee ballots, click here. **To vote absentee, you must have registered in person OR have previously voted in person. You may not vote absentee as the first time ever voted.** Whew!! I can almost hear you say, Jerri!! That is so much info, lawyer lady! And you are running unopposed in the Democratic primary? Why is it important to go vote this time?? People, look around. While I know I will be on the November ballot, regardless, we need to be showing up in droves. There are other consequential races to be decided this August election, of course. Most importantly, however: We. Will. Be. Heard. We. Will. Be. Seen. We. Will. Be. Victorious. These late summer primaries are the Democrats’ warning shots across the bow—we’re coming for you, and we’re coming in strong. Our numbers now are just the beginning. Down ballot elections like State House Representative don’t always get a lot of recognition or attention. But what we do impacts the chain all the way to the top. I’ve said it before and I’ll keep saying it—decisions are made by those who show up. Show up. We will be seen. We will be heard. We will be victorious. 103 days and counting, Jerri #onetoughmother #bluewave #novemberiscoming p.s. You will note this was NOT a fundraising e-mail!

almost there… Wow. We did it team! THANK YOU! I just got word that we surpassed our end of month goal. We smashed through $12,000 raised about 3 hours ago! This race is a dead heat and every vote is going to count. Your support is going directly to communicating our shared vision for Tennessee, so thank you once more. But we're not stopping there! The fundraising team has upped our goal to $15,000 and are confident we're going to smash that too. So talk to your friends and family, and let's leave it all out on the field in these final days of the campaign. Onward, Jerri #OneToughMother GIVE NOW \---------- Forwarded message --------- From: Jerri Green <[[URL REDACTED]]> Date: Wed, Sep 23, 2020 at 9:30 AM Subject: Simply incredible response – THANK YOU! To: [[EMAIL_REDACTED]] Friends, I am writing to thank all of you who stepped up and answered our call. I told you at the start of last week we needed to raise $12,000 by the end of this month. You helped us raise almost all of that in just one week. In fact, we are now less than $500 from reaching that goal! I know I shouldn’t be surprised by your generosity at this point in the campaign, but I am still overwhelmed with gratitude. Now let’s finish what we started. Please chip in here to help us raise the remaining $420 to reach our goal before the end of September! These dollars are specifically being used to target voters through mailings and social media ads, to help us get out our message of compassion and common sense. According to all the polls this race is a dead heat! We know the difference between being within striking distance and actually winning will be a matter reaching voters, and doing so early. This election year, from the top of the ticket to the bottom, let’s make sure we do everything we can to make a change in our government and a difference for our community.

Friends, Campaigns, I am learning, are a lot like marathons. You have to put in the work daily. And it takes time and it is hard, and mostly no one sees what you pour into that one day, that one race. But little by little that work adds up. Our campaign kickoff party on January 30 seems like a lifetime ago. I cannot begin to express my gratitude to you, my supporters, volunteers, donors, postcard writers, sign deliverers, zoom attenders, phone bankers, buzz starters, Facebook sharers, re-tweeters, t-shirt wearers, and all-around wonderful people who have helped elevate this campaign since our kickoff. We would not be here today were it not for your devotion and dedication to the belief that Tennessee and District 83 are ready to see new leadership, ready to have new voices, ready to start flipping Tennessee blue. Not only have you held on and supported Team One Tough Mother, you have done so during the most difficult of times, when the world has literally shut down and fallen apart around us, making traditional campaigning a thing of the past. Your tenacity and willingness to adapt and move forward speak volumes. Again, thank you, from the bottom of my heart. And now the hard work really begins. There are exactly 88 days from August 7th to November 3rd. The marathon that we just finished? Drink some Gatorade, get some carbs and do some stretching. It’s uphill sprint time. You may or may not have noticed our messaging in the community is becoming more frequent. (So is the competition’s.) There are more signs to be placed, door hangers to be hung, phone calls, and texts to go out. We are out to win. And that world crumbling around our ears thing? It’s still happening, so our traditional methods of get out the vote and fundraising are out the window. It’s up to YOU, our volunteers, to make the magic happen. Think of us like an interconnected web, expanding outward and outward, reaching every corner of District 83. Together, we will prevail. But it will take a village, it will take perseverance, and it will take work. Given the seismic changes that have happened in the last few months , I cannot begin to predict what the world (and the Republicans) will throw at us in the next 88 days. But know this: in the words of the great Michelle Obama, “When they go low, we go high.” Which doesn’t mean we won’t highlight the shortcomings, back pedaling, and harmful positions of my opponent. But it does mean that I have an incredible network of people working for me, doing the right things for the right reasons. Those reasons are the communal goals we share, and are my mantra for running in the first place: bring common sense and compassion to Nashville.  So much could and would be better right now if those guiding principles were used more. But I know with your help, we will be seen. We will be heard. We will be victorious. Thank you again.

Major Deadline Tomorrow Friend, Look, I don’t like asking for money. No one does, right? Especially in a world where families are waiting in food lines and job security seems more uncertain. And asking for a donation to a political campaign can be even more unseemly. But the truth is, I have to ask. And this ask isn’t for me. I am asking for us, for our community, for the future of this state. Before I got involved in running for office I thought all the donations were made from fat cat millionaires and corporations who expected favors in return. And while that may be true for my opponent, who has collected almost $60,000 from PACs this year alone, it is not true for me. This campaign has been built on small dollar donations from over 500 grassroots supporters. I am humbled and grateful for all of this support. But as we approach the next fundraising deadline this Tuesday, I need to call on you again. Whether it is buying yard signs or social media ads, paying for postcards or one tough mother tees, campaigns cost money. Every dollar spent helps us raise our profile and turn out the vote to beat a 10-year incumbent with name recognition and a war chest of dark money. Like it or not, money = profile. Mark White has a ten-year profile and we are just getting started. Whether you chip in $25 or commit to $250 or more, every penny spent is spent wisely to help us win in November. And that is why I am asking again, even if I don’t want to. I have to. As the recent news has shown, there is too much at stake. I need your help to flip this seat so we can bring compassion and common sense back to our state capital. This deadline on Tuesday is our biggest yet. All eyes across the state are watching this race. Let’s show them how much momentum we have; just how invested people are in bringing a change to this community. [insert another give button of some type] Again, thank you for all you have done to support this campaign already. It is truly overwhelming, and I am very thankful. You are the force driving us forward, farther, and higher.

Join us on August 27th... Friends, Remember high school, on the day of a big game, the whole student body would gather together, packed like sardines shoulder to shoulder, chanting, yelling together as one to spur our team to victory? For me, that feels like both yesterday and a million years ago. What if I told you we could go back in time, just for a moment (sort of)? Relive the glory of getting amped up, heart swelling with pride and camaraderie, ready to do what it takes to win? Join us for a campaign pep rally this Thursday, August 27 at 7 PM. We won’t be in a packed gymnasium. (COVID-19 prohibits that, obviously. It wouldn’t smell so good, anyway.) On August 27, we will convene virtually, over Zoom, for the first time as a united team, all of us for One Tough Virtual Rally, where we will: * Hear from the candidate, and meet my team, who have been working tirelessly for months now; * Lay out our road map for the coming months and for our path to VICTORY; * Identify exciting volunteer opportunities; * GET PUMPED \- there are 68 days between August 27 and November 3! We know District 83 has the numbers to flip blue and that momentum is on our side, we can feel the vibration in the air. We just need to make sure we are getting out the vote in every way we can. CAN WE COUNT ON YOU TO BE PART OF OUR ONE TOUGH VOLUNTEER ARMY? Join us Thursday, August 27 @ 7PM to see how YOU can help me bring common sense and compassion to Nashville: Of course, people who volunteer are usually the busiest people going, so it’s possible you have a conflict next Thursday. That’s ok, we totally get it! Feel free to RSVP with your contact information and note in which area you would like to volunteer and our coordinators will get in touch with you. And, of course, I would be remiss if I did not say that it is always acceptable to help our campaign with a donation—none is too small or too large (within applicable campaign finance limits). In the words of Helen Keller, “Alone we can do so little, but together we can do so much.” This race will be close. It will take all of us, together, but we will succeed. We will be seen. We will be heard. We will be victorious.

In the past few days, the air has a new crisp feeling,... Friends, In the past few days, the air has a new crisp feeling, leaves a starting show some brown and red edges, and more and more political signs (many with my name on them) are popping up in yards around our neighborhoods. The calendar reads ends of September—it’s fall and we are weeks out from the general election. I feel like a broken record thanking you over and over again for all the work you have done as One Tough Volunteer Army, but we would never have made it this far, this strong without you. Today’s email is short and sweet (how many might describe me?). There is so much communication flying around, we want to get information to our volunteers simpler and faster. How? Well, turns out we live in an age of many platforms that do just this. Welcome to our rapid response WhatsApp group. Click the link below and you will be directed to a continuous private, encrypted chat group of One Tough Mother Volunteers. CLICK HERE TO JOIN ONE TOUGH MOTHER'S WhatsApp GROUP (best if accessed on a phone) What’s WhatsApp? It’s a messaging app that allows us to have semi-private group communications that won’t be e-mail or social media based. This way you can receive information and reminders from the campaign that isn’t being broadcast on a general public basis. It also gives our volunteers a way to communicate with each other and the campaign as we come down this home stretch, giving us one more way to connect as One Tough Community. If you have any questions about the WhatsApp group, feel free to reach out to Teasha at [[URL REDACTED]] or Liz at [[URL REDACTED]] There are many upcoming volunteer tasks, big and small and they sometimes come up on a moment’s notice. Many can be done from your home, so join up and get busy. Let’s bring it home for compassion and common sense.

and thousands of voters are waiting to hear our message Friends – During this pandemic we have had to be a little more creative with our voter outreach. But thanks dozens of volunteers, even during quarantine, we were able to write over 5,000 personalized postcards to voters. You read that right – OVER 5,000 HAND WRITTEN NOTES about our campaign to bring compassion and common sense back to our government are ready to go in the mail! If you were a part of this incredible effort I want to say thank you. We know personal touches like these have a big impact. In fact, in the last election in District 83, the places where these cards were sent the democratic candidate, Danielle Schonbaum, over performed expectations. In other words, the voters read the words of volunteers and took their messages to heart as they entered the polling places. We are now ready to do this again. But like with all things related to the campaign, the next step requires resources. The good news is you can HELP US PUT POSTAGE ON 100 OF THESE CARDS FOR A DONATION OF JUST $35 today. $35 for 100 postcards $70 for 200 postcards $175 for 500 postcards By becoming a stamp sponsor, whether you helped write these cards or not, you still play a major role in delivering our message to voters and increasing turnout on election day. Can you help us finish this incredible effort and make a direct impact on the election this year? If so, please give now. Again, I am ever grateful to you all for every way you have helped us work hard to win this seat in November. Now let’s finish what we started, Jerri #OneToughMother P.S. If you were a postcard writer and have not returned your cards yet, please let us know so we can come and get them! Email [[URL REDACTED]] to schedule a pickup.

Well, that’s that folks. As the polls close and our wait begins, I’m overcome with emotions. While the results are still being tabulated, a few things are certain: 1. I am an incredibly lucky person to have such: a supportive and loving family, loyal and reliable friends, and a passionate and determined team. Whatever the result tonight none of this would have been possible without YOU, my people. 2. I started this campaign with a deep love for our city, our state, and our country. That love has only gotten deeper over the last year. This campaign has given me an opportunity to connect with neighbors and community members on a deeper level. I have heard hopes and dreams, fears and struggles. Some conversations have been more difficult than others, but this campaign was always about more than just this election year. It was about starting some much-needed conversations about what our values truly are, and while those principles may still differ, acknowledging we can discuss those differences with civility and find common sense solutions that come from our compassion for one another. 3. Win or lose, we cannot lose this momentum towards putting our state and our country back together in the image we know it can be. We are all in this together and we cannot go it alone. So, take tonight and the next few weeks in stride. Be kind to each other, and fight like hell for our shared values. This is just a beginning to a better future. I’m still fired up and I hope you are too. Like I said, I just wanted to drop you this quick note before results start coming in. I promise I will send out a longer email when we know more. Until then, THANK YOU from the bottom of heart! Your support means the world to me and I cannot wait until we can all be together again.

Do you have a plan? Friends, It’s almost impossible to believe, but the time is here… early voting begins Wednesday, October 14! Many of you may have already voted via absentee ballot or have requested an absentee ballot. If, however, like me, you are planning to vote early, now is the time to make sure you have your plans set. Here is the information you should have at the ready: * There are 26 different early voting locations in Shelby County. Here is a link to the list of locations and their hours of operation. CLICK HERE TO VIEW ALL LOCATIONS. Any registered voter in Shelby County who has not requested an absentee ballot can vote early at any of these locations. * Plan now which location and date you want to vote!  Having a plan ensures you will follow up. Have a back-up date if the first date doesn’t work out for some reason, such as the line is too long or you don’t feel comfortable with the number of people there. * Bring photo ID with you. Always make sure to bring your photo ID with you to your voting location. The poll worker will check your ID against voter rolls. * If someone you don’t know tries to tell you that you are ineligible to vote but you believe you are, stay in line. You are, at a minimum, entitled to a provisional ballot. Report voter intimidation to the Tennessee Department of State, and the United States Department of Justice, Voting Rights Division (800) 253-3931. * Make a plan to bring friends with you to vote. Voting in numbers is voting with power! Call your friends and neighbors in District 83- talk to them about our One Tough Mother campaign, and bring them to the polls with you. Democracy in action! * Early voting runs October 14 to October 29. The General Election will be held on November 3. If you don’t make it to early voting, you will still be able to vote on November 3 at your regular polling location. Vote One Tough Mother! This is what we’ve been waiting for! Truly, we would not be here without all of you. All the cheers, tears, laughs, notes, thank yous, hurrahs, go-get-‘ems, we’re-with-yous, ALL THE THINGS come down to NOW. I’m hoping that by November 3, there will be little left to say except THANK YOU. So, please, stay safe, get friends, mask up, and VOTE. (And VOTE BLUE!!!) While I’m here a small (non-monetary) ask. All these polls? We need some people to staff them to remind District 83 voters that we want to vote for common sense and compassion returning to our state government. There are four main early voting sites that HD 83 voters frequent. If you are interested in hanging out in the wonderful Memphis fall weather, shaking a Jerri sign to remind voters of their #priorities, sign-up below to take a shift. It’s good fun, and a great way to do some civic duty.

We just got our report card and it's... Friends, Today we released a video discussing Tennessee’s failing grade in education. Another report card came out today, from none other than the National Rifle Association. And you know what? The NRA gave my opponent a passing grade with flying colors, while I got a big ol’ F. Show the NRA what you think of the grade here! In today’s uncertain world, there is so much that divides us. One thing unites us, however: a vast majority of Tennesseans believe that we are failing in efforts to control and regulate the use and sale of firearms. FACTS: * Tennessee ranks 12th in the United States for death by gun violence. * Tennessee ranks first in the United States for child deaths by gun violence. * 93% of Tennesseans oppose permit-less carry. * A majority of Tennesseans oppose allowing unsecured guns in cars, arming teachers, and concealed carry on campus. * 80% of Tennesseans support universal background checks. Another fact? The National Rifle Association thinks my opponent is doing a solid job opposing gun sense laws. I agree. This is quite literally an issue that is life or death for too many in Tennessee, and as a person who has had gun violence impact my life three times, I promise you it isn’t political for me. It’s personal. And while the images and stories you see daily in the news may seem overwhelming, know you can do something to help. You can elect gun sense candidates like me. I have worked to make common sense changes to our laws to protect our children for years, and I am not about to stop now. The NRA can bank on that. But we will be fighting their vast network of dark money to flip this seat. So, please consider a donation of $20.20 or $200.20 (or more!) today to help us fight back. With great rights come great responsibilities. Our current elected officials have neglected the second half of this, and the NRA knows it. This is one class I am proud to have failed.

It is clear from the nightly news that people are clamoring for change, a change in leadership particularly. It is clear from the nightly news that people are clamoring for change, a change in leadership particularly. Whether it is because of the terrible mishandling of the pandemic response or the racial and socioeconomic systemic injustices going unaddressed, those who currently hold power are losing support. And campaigns like ours are gaining momentum. Because people have hope that if their elected representatives were guided by compassion and common sense there wouldn’t be such overwhelming unrest, daily confusion, and collective heartbreak in our communities. People are looking for new leaders, better leaders. And they deserve them. However, those in power won’t go away without a fight. My opponent, Rep. Mark White, recently sent an email to his supporters alerting them that he would have stiff opposition this time, and it would take a vigorous effort for him to hold on to his seat. They see us. They see the army of hard working volunteers hand writing thousands of postcards, making hundreds of phone calls, and amplifying our message on social media daily – all to reach voters, flip this seat in November, and break up the strangle-hold of the GOP supermajority in our state. That’s why 10 year incumbent Mr. White is asking his donors to give hundreds, even thousands of dollars to fight against our grassroots campaign; to try to defeat me – a mom who is simply trying to make the future better for her kids. Maybe that is why they are so scared. Everyone knows no one fights harder than a mama bear protecting her cubs. But I’m not scared. Because I know I can count on you to help me fight back. Now that he and others have taken notice, it is important we don’t back down. That’s why I’m asking you to give what you can to help us fight against the war chest he and the well-funded Tennessee GOP are building. And in the next 48 hours the first $2,500 we receive in donations will be matched!! Can you help us turn $2,500 into $5,000? They will certainly take notice of that. No matter what your donation, I am always humbled and thankful for your support, because no donation is too small to help us in this fight for a better future for our families and our communities.

The news of the global pandemic, powerful protests, presidential campaigns, and important Supreme Court decisions, can be all-consuming. I understand it is easy to lose track of what state legislatures are doing. Friends, I just wanted to take a moment and say thank you. I am so very grateful for each and every one of you. People often thank me for stepping up to run for office, but the truth is I am not doing this alone. So, THANK YOU: * to the nearly 100 volunteers writing thousands upon thousands of personalized post cards, * to the nearly 500 grassroots donors who have given to our campaign, * to the dozens of phone bankers who are making connections to voters weekly, * to the more than 100 supporters who have already agreed to let us put a sign in your yard, * to the thousands of you who follow us on social media and share our message, * to everyone who is wearing your One Tough Mother tee around town, * to each individual who has told a friend about this race, our message, and our campaign to bring compassion and common sense back to our capital, and * to my family, who not only makes this campaign possible, but also inspires me to make our community better in the future. TOGETHER, WE ARE ONE TOUGH TEAM! I am humbled and honored to be working alongside all of you. I know this support is not about me. It is about a shared vision for a better tomorrow for our families, our community, and our state. Too many people are currently reeling from the onslaught of distressing news, and rightfully so. It is clear more than ever we must make a change in our leadership. The stakes are too high not to be actively working to make a difference. Every bit counts. That is why, as our next filing deadline approaches, I am asking for you to chip in once again to help us win this election. Whether it is $20 or $200, please know, I understand what these dollars mean as we face further uncertainty in our state and country. But we need funding to flip this seat, as we battle a ten-year incumbent with a war chest of dark money. He is feeling the pressure, and we need to keep our momentum moving. I’ve said it before and I’ll keep saying it until we’re done--it’s hard, but hard is not impossible. Thank you again. I could do none of this without you all. Now let’s go win this thing.

Friend – I don’t have to tell you that this is an election like no other. And as you know, votes are being cast -- through early voting or by mail – as you read this. That means we have to make sure our organizing and advertising programs are running at full speed in these final days. We can’t afford to miss any voters before they cast their ballots. That’s why we’re still counting on more people chipping in today to make sure we have the resources we need to run those programs. Can you chip in $25 right now? GIVE $25 GIVE $50 GIVE $100 GIVE $250 I know your family and community need your energy and resources first and foremost during these trying times, and it might be a tough time to give to a political campaign. But this really is a grassroots campaign, so I’m asking because this campaign has been built on over a thousand supporters giving what they can because they believe in our message of compassion and common sense. It is supporters like you that will lead us to victory. Anything you’re able to give will go directly towards putting more ads on TV and online, towards sending the texts and making the phone calls to voters that will make sure we win in November. And if you haven’t yet given, now is the time. These final days are critical. Now, let’s go win this thing together, Jerri #OneToughMother CLICK HERE TO FIND A POLLING LOCATION NEAR YOU If you or someone you know needs a ride to the polls please call 1-844-901-VOTE Paid for by One Tough Mother - Danielle Schonbaum, Treasurer One Tough Mother PO Box 771061 Memphis, TN 38177 United States If you believe you received this message in error or wish to no longer receive email from us, please unsubscribe.

almost there… Friends, I am writing to thank all of you who stepped up and answered our call. I told you at the start of last week we needed to raise $12,000 by the end of this month. You helped us raise almost all of that in just one week. In fact, we are now less than $500 from reaching that goal! I know I shouldn’t be surprised by your generosity at this point in the campaign, but I am still overwhelmed with gratitude. Now let’s finish what we started. Please chip in here to help us raise the remaining $420 to reach our goal before the end of September! These dollars are specifically being used to target voters through mailings and social media ads, to help us get out our message of compassion and common sense. According to all the polls this race is a dead heat! We know the difference between being within striking distance and actually winning will be a matter reaching voters, and doing so early. This election year, from the top of the ticket to the bottom, let’s make sure we do everything we can to make a change in our government and a difference for our community.

I am thrilled to say that in the past 48 hours so many of you have stepped up Dear Friends, I am thrilled to say that in the past 48 hours so many of you have stepped up to help us reach our matching goal of $2500 that we are less than $100 away from meeting that mark! Since we are so very close we have been given until the end of the day to get there. The clock is ticking! Can you chip in to help us push us over the finish line? If so click below to give. Thanks always for all you do to help our campaign to flip HD 83 and make a real difference in Tennessee. Best, Danielle Treasurer of One Tough Mother \---------- Forwarded message --------- From: Dave Cambron <[[URL REDACTED]]> Date: Sat, Jun 6, 2020 at 11:00 AM Subject: ICYMI FWD: People are taking notice of our campaign…including my opponent To: Alex Brown <[[EMAIL_REDACTED]]> Friend, I wanted to make sure you got Jerri's email on Thursday. This race is tightening everyday. Her opponent is running scared and now is our time to give Jerri that extra boost the campaign needs as summer starts. Thanks to matching dollars we can turn $2500 into $5000 for the campaign, and we are already over half way there! Donate what you can today to help ensure we elect Jerri in November and send One Tough Mother to represent us in Nashville. \- Dave Cambron \---------- Forwarded message --------- From: Jerri Green <[[URL REDACTED]]> Date: Thu, Jun 4, 2020 at 1:01 PM Subject: People are taking notice of our campaign…including my opponent To: Alex Brown <[[EMAIL_REDACTED]]> It is clear from the nightly news that people are clamoring for change, a change in leadership particularly. Whether it is because of the terrible mishandling of the pandemic response or the racial and socioeconomic systemic injustices going unaddressed, those who currently hold power are losing support. And campaigns like ours are gaining momentum. Because people have hope that if their elected representatives were guided by compassion and common sense there wouldn’t be such overwhelming unrest, daily confusion, and collective heartbreak in our communities. People are looking for new leaders, better leaders. And they deserve them. However, those in power won’t go away without a fight. My opponent, Rep. Mark White, recently sent an email to his supporters alerting them that he would have stiff opposition this time, and it would take a vigorous effort for him to hold on to his seat. They see us. They see the army of hard working volunteers hand writing thousands of postcards, making hundreds of phone calls, and amplifying our message on social media daily – all to reach voters, flip this seat in November, and break up the strangle-hold of the GOP supermajority in our state. That’s why 10 year incumbent Mr. White is asking his donors to give hundreds, even thousands of dollars to fight against our grassroots campaign; to try to defeat me – a mom who is simply trying to make the future better for her kids. Maybe that is why they are so scared. Everyone knows no one fights harder than a mama bear protecting her cubs. But I’m not scared. Because I know I can count on you to help me fight back. Now that he and others have taken notice, it is important we don’t back down. That’s why I’m asking you to give what you can to help us fight against the war chest he and the well-funded Tennessee GOP are building. And in the next 48 hours the first $2,500 we receive in donations will be matched!! Can you help us turn $2,500 into $5,000? They will certainly take notice of that. No matter what your donation, I am always humbled and thankful for your support, because no donation is too small to help us in this fight for a better future for our families and our communities. Together we can do it. We must Keep safe and keep making your voice heard, Jerri Green #OneToughMother P.S.

Looking forward to seeing you tonight. \- One Tough Mother Team \---------- Forwarded message --------- From: Jerri Green Date: Mon, Aug 24, 1:01 PM Subject: We're having a rally! To: <[[EMAIL_REDACTED]]> Friends, Remember high school, on the day of a big game, the whole student body would gather together, packed like sardines shoulder to shoulder, chanting, yelling together as one to spur our team to victory? For me, that feels like both yesterday and a million years ago. What if I told you we could go back in time, just for a moment (sort of)? Relive the glory of getting amped up, heart swelling with pride and camaraderie, ready to do what it takes to win? Join us for a campaign pep rally this Thursday, August 27 at 7 PM. We won’t be in a packed gymnasium. (COVID-19 prohibits that, obviously. It wouldn’t smell so good, anyway.) On August 27, we will convene virtually, over Zoom, for the first time as a united team, all of us for One Tough Virtual Rally, where we will: * Hear from the candidate, and meet my team, who have been working tirelessly for months now; * Lay out our road map for the coming months and for our path to VICTORY; * Identify exciting volunteer opportunities; * GET PUMPED \- there are 68 days between August 27 and November 3! We know District 83 has the numbers to flip blue and that momentum is on our side, we can feel the vibration in the air. We just need to make sure we are getting out the vote in every way we can. CAN WE COUNT ON YOU TO BE PART OF OUR ONE TOUGH VOLUNTEER ARMY? Join us Thursday, August 27 @ 7PM to see how YOU can help me bring common sense and compassion to Nashville: Of course, people who volunteer are usually the busiest people going, so it’s possible you have a conflict next Thursday. That’s ok, we totally get it! Feel free to RSVP with your contact information and note in which area you would like to volunteer and our coordinators will get in touch with you. And, of course, I would be remiss if I did not say that it is always acceptable to help our campaign with a donation—none is too small or too large (within applicable campaign finance limits). In the words of Helen Keller, “Alone we can do so little, but together we can do so much.” This race will be close. It will take all of us, together, but we will succeed. We will be seen. We will be heard. We will be victorious.

My Mother has a plan to vote; do you? My mother, Madeleine, spent much of 2020 in a state of disbelief. I have never seen her so deeply concerned about the state of our country and the world. And while - like many others - the events of 2020 have profoundly affected her, at the top of any list of concerns is a political environment in which norms and standards are broken and ignored, vulnerable groups continue to be marginalized, and state violence is held to account increasingly less often. My mother sees too many parallels between the current state of affairs and the creation of an environment that led to the murder of my maternal and paternal grandparents by the Nazi state. I could go on about this, but I think she expresses it best herself. Please spend a couple of minutes listening to her discuss why voting in 2020 is so critical. CLICK HERE TO WATCH MY MOM'S MESSAGE. I am sure that most of you that are receiving this email are inclined to vote, but that is not true for almost 50% of Tennesseans. So I implore you to join my mother and not only vote, but to commit to speaking with your children, grandchildren, friends, colleagues - whoever you can think of - to make sure that they are registered to vote: DEADLINE TO REGISTER TO VOTE IN TN: OCTOBER 5th CLICK HERE TO REGISTER TO VOTE. And second, make sure that you and yours have a plan to vote. We must VOTE in such numbers that the election cannot be in doubt. VOTE so that there can be no way forward other than a peaceful and orderly transfer of power to the next administration. VOTE for the continuation of democracy. And, in Tennessee, VOTE for common sense and compassion to be restored to our state government by electing leaders like Jerri Green to the General Assembly.

Larry Grooms doesn't work for us. He works for special interests. View this email in your browser Good Afternoon! Kathryn here from Team Whitaker HQ (AKA my living room). I know first hand how dismissive and out-of-touch some of our elected officials are in Columbia. Two years ago, I traveled to Columbia to advocate for making early education a priority in our state, as only 4 out of 10 kids in the tri-county area arrive ready for kindergarten. We know early education is a great investment with a long-term impact. And there are sensible solutions we can model off of what other states have done successfully. Neither my state senator nor my state representative responded to multiple attempts to schedule a meeting. And when I caught up to Senator Larry Grooms in the lobby that day, his main concern was what our group had brought for our legislative lunch. Once I finally started talking about early education, he told me that he couldn’t do anything about it because he had “too many other irons in the fire.” That was the day I decided I was running for office and against him. No longer can we stifle voices because they don’t have the same money to contribute as big corporations. Our children should come before high-paid lobbyists. We need leaders who will prioritize all South Carolinians. Leaders who will work across the aisle and get things done. Leaders who listen to their constituents instead of special interests. Our leaders are supposed to work for us. Larry Grooms hasn’t; that’s why I am running to replace him. Our grassroots campaign is fueled by the very people that we will fight for in Columbia. Can you chip in $20 to help our campaign bring back common sense, compassionate representation for District 37? Thank you for your support -- we’re excited to have you in this fight with us, and we couldn't do it without you. Kathryn Whitaker Candidate for SC Senate District 37 Chip in to help us shake-up the State House Twitter Facebook Website Instagram Email Kathryn Whitaker is a parent, not a politician.

Hi Alex, I wanted to reach out and ask: Did you see Kathy's email (below) from Saturday? We are coming up on the end of the final quarter of this campaign. Voters in Ohio can start voting next week and we need to be 100% certain we have reached everyone that we can to let them know they can vote out corruption and vote for a candidate with compassion and common sense, and who has integrity. You won't find any scandals or indictments in this campaign! Funds raised right now will determine just how much money we have to spend on digital advertisements and direct mail. Right now, we don't have enough to meet our goal, and I'm worried. Will you chip in today to help make sure Kathy wins this election? I'm so tired of seeing the same old people going back to Columbus for more of the same old problems. We need change! Donate Today Thank you for support! It means a great deal to me! Ashley, Campaign Manager ********************************** Alex, We are approaching the end of the quarter and the beginning of our final weeks of campaigning. Everything we've worked so hard for these last few months matters as many voters begin casting their ballots in October. The majority of people make their decision about who to vote for as it gets closer to Election Day, making these final weeks the most important. Unfortunately, we aren't where we planned to be by the end of September in order to reach all the voters we need to reach. Can you help us reach our quarterly goal so we can get our message in front of as many voters as possible? Donate $25 Donate $100 Due to the pandemic, we haven't been able to campaign in person like in a typical year. Reaching voters through digital ads and mail is the most effective way to reach people in the absence of face to face voter contact. Can I count on you to help us reach our goal?

We can correct this, Alex. Alex, Did you see the news out of Ohio last week? A high-ranking politician and 4 other men were arrested on racketeering charges. Larry Householder's actions are now in the hands of the FBI and federal attorneys. Hopefully, justice will be served, and HB6 will be repealed. (You can read my op-ed in Monday's Enquirer on why I think that's important.) Unfortunately, this is nothing new. For years there has been a culture of corruption in Ohio politics, and the only way we can correct this is to change who we send to Columbus. I'm running on a campaign to bring common sense back to Columbus. My commitment is to get Ohioans back to work, keep small businesses open during this pandemic, make sure health care is between you and your doctor (not your insurance company) and strengthen education. We have a filing deadline on Friday and my team tells me we need to raise a little more than $4,000 to meet our goal. Can you help us meet our goal? Donate $25  Donate $50 Unlike my opponent, I don't have any dark money PACs spending money to help me win. I rely on individual donors who make small contributions. Every dollar I receive goes toward spreading my message that it's time to quit the political games and get back to common sense. Ohio can be a state that works for all of us, not just the corporations that buy off politicians. Together, we can put People Over Politics and #CleanUpColumbus. Thank you!

Here's what matters. Alex, In a minute I'm going to tell you what my top priorities are, but first I need to ask if you're able to contribute to my campaign today. Tomorrow is the end of June, and my team tells me we are behind, and we have a big order for yard signs coming up soon. Contribute Today I'm running for office for a few very simple reasons. I believe health care shouldn't be such as hassle. It should be easy to get and it should be something we can afford. I believe a good economy is personal to each of us. For some, it's saving for retirement. For others, it's making sure they can pay the mortgage, or pay their employees. And still for others, it's saving for college, or paying down student loans. The economy is personal, and it should ~ and can ~ work for everyone. I believe that good public schools are the foundation for a strong economy in every zip code. Education is the starting point, and Ohio should be investing in and strenghtening schools from pre-K to college. Alex, the above issues are what most Ohioans are worried about. These are the common sense issues that Ohio's lawmakers should be focusing on, rather than playing political games like vowing to never wear a mask in the name of personal freedom. Will you contribute to my campaign today so we can break free from political stunts and start fixing what's broken? We need to raise another $1,100 by tomorrow night to meet our goal. Donate $25 Donate $40 Donate $50 Donate $100 Donate Other Can you rush this donation in so that we can make sure we have enough funds to order our yard signs? Thank you!

Why would we stop testing? Alex, Ohio State Representative Nino Vitale has managed to make the ridiculous hashtag of Stop Getting Tested trend on Twitter. Will you chip in $5 to this campaign so we can help break the supermajority in Columbus and bring some level-headedness and common sense to Ohio's Legislative Branch? Chip in $5 for Common Sense Today Stopping testing will not make the coronavirus go away, and it won't make us worry less. That's just common sense, and you don't need to be a medical expert to know that. Testing is an important part of managing this pandemic. It enables health departments to identify where hotspots are and understand when and where hospitalizations might start increasing. Vitale and Ohio's other supermajority members are so out-of-touch with most Ohioans. We are worried about us, or our loved ones, getting sick. Parents are worried about sending their kids to school. Teachers are worried about how they are going to do their job this fall. Employers don't want their businesses to shut down again. Chip in $5 Today If we all work together and speak out often enough, we can turn things around in this state. Help me do that today. I appreciate your support!

Dear Alex, Today, I am endorsing Kathy Wyenandt for State Senate because she represents the kind of new leadership that Ohio desperately needs. I have known Kathy for nearly a decade, and I have long admired the way she balances motherhood and working for her community. She understands that life is about finding balance and working hard on the things that make sense for everyone. She doesn't have time to waste playing politics. I'm supporting Kathy because Ohio needs more common sense legislators who know how -- and are willing -- to roll up their sleeves to find solutions for our most pressing problems. Help send Kathy to the Ohio Statehouse. Ohio needs leaders in the Statehouse who will fight for Ohio families, who can plan ahead for the next crisis we might face, and who believe that people must come first.

Check out our merch, Alex Hey Alex, This weekend we kick off our summer Days of Action for my campaign to bring common sense to the Ohio State Senate and fight for things that matter. Because of COVID-19 and the need to contain its spread, this Day of Action will be virtual. What is a virtual Day of Action? A Day of Action is a chance for supporters like you to share my campaign's message of People Over Politics. People in Butler County (and everywhere, really!) are tired of the political games. Ohio needs leaders who will work on the every day issues most of us are facing. How can I participate? ▶️ Join us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to re-share what my campaign posts throughout the day. ▶️ Call, text or email a few friends with a link to my website and tell them why you support me and ask them to sign up to receive my emails. Alex, have you checked out our merch shop? Visibility is an important part of our campaign. You can help with that by wearing one of our campaign shirts when you're out, or by putting a bumper sticker on your car. We hope voters see Kathy Wyenandt for State Senate everywhere. CLICK HERE FOR MERCH Thank you for being such a great supporter of my campaign, Alex. I know if we stick together, keep talking to our friends and neighbors, we can flip this district and make Ohio start working for ALL of us. Let's do this!

Here's 5 good reasons to vote for Kathy Hey Alex, Here are 5 good reasons to vote for Kathy Wyenandt this November: 1) Kathy wants to help get people back to work safely and see our communities thrive. The coronavirus upended everything, and families are hurting. Lawmakers in Ohio should be doing everything they can to support our families, our schools and our communities. 2) Kathy believes healthcare decisions should be between you and your doctor, not your health insurance company. Health care has become a huge hassle for many of us, and it can be too expensive. All too often, precious time is spent negotiating whether a prescription is necessary, not to mention the time spent waiting for approval to see a specialist. Ohio lawmakers can make this a priority. 3) Kathy knows a good education is where it all begins, and that a strong public education is the foundation for a strong economy. Investment in education increases property values and makes communities more appealing to new businesses. 4) When it comes to rolling up her sleeves and getting to work, Kathy can do it! As a mother of 4, school and community volunteer, and small business owner with her husband, Kathy knows how to build a coalition and solve problems using common sense. And, finally, another reason to vote for Kathy this November is: 5) Kathy doesn't play political games. It's time for commonsense leadership in Columbus, not extreme views that benefit mega donors and unknown dark money PACs. Alex, can you chip in $5 for these 5 good reasons to vote for Kathy? $5 for Friday Thank you for your support! We can elect Kathy and bring common sense back to Columbus and make government work for the people. Team Kathy Request a Yard Sign Paid for by Friends of Kathy Wyenandt P.O.

Decisions are being made now. Dear Alex, Our end of quarter deadline lets us know just how much money we have to spend to reach voters in Butler County. Right now, we don't have enough funds to reach all the people we planned to reach. Can you help out? Donate to Deadline Fund I know we've been asking a lot lately, Alex, and I hope you know I wouldn't be asking so often if it wasn't so important. Last week I debated my opponents in a virtual debate and hearing how neither opponent has any concrete plans to solve our toughtest challenges was disappointing. No healthcare plan, no jobs plan, no plan for improving education. I want to make sure that every person in this district knows there is a better choice for them at the polls. They can vote for me and help bring common sense leadership and integrity to the Statehouse in Columbus. But I can't get there without your support. If you can, will you chip in today?

Alex, Recent events in the news have left me questioning whether Ohio is a state that is moving forward, or moving back, in time. We must join together to elect leaders, like me, who will move our state forward. We have just under 5 months until the November election. Will you start a recurring monthly contribution so that my campaign has the funds it needs to win in November? Ohioans around the state are speaking out and protesting in support of Black Lives Matter while the Ohio House leadership holds committee meetings on Stand Your Ground legislation. A sitting state senator from the Dayton area referred to black people as "coloreds." In our own community, my opponent has stated he believes coronavirus may be a hoax. Support my campaign today to bring common sense back to Columbus. The status quo isn't working. We're living in a new normal and that requires new leaders. I'm listening and my campaign is adjusting to this new normal. Join us and help make history this November by flipping this district! Start my recurring donation As always, I appreciate your support.

We're behind on our goal. Alex -- I know I've sent out a few emails already this week, so I'll keep this brief. We're behind on our goal for June and we have just 11 days left in the month. Can you chip in $10 today so we can raise an additional $900 before the weekend? Ohio Senate Democrats have designated this district a District to Watch. This campaign has what it takes to flip Butler County in November! People are tired of the political games politicians are playing and are calling for a return to common sense. ✔️ It would be common sense to focus on how to help school districts return to school safely this fall. ✔️ Common sense acknowledges there's a problem and supports the resolution to declare racism a public health crisis. ✔️ It's common sense to wear a mask in public to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. But these common sense ideas are lost on the majority of our Senate politicians. Alex, it's not a foregone conclusion that the status quo will win in Butler County. We are already winning every single day because voters like you are supporting our campaign. Will you chip in $10 today so that I can raise $900 before the weekend and stay on track for June? If we stick together and agree that it's time to put people over politics we can win in November and start moving Ohio forward!

Help us bring common sense to Columbus. Alex, Picture of Kathy WyenandtIf there's a single issue that sums up the difference between common sense and playing political games, it's the simple act of wearing a mask. Presently, the majority of Ohio's lawmakers (including my opponent) refuse to wear, or support the wearing of, masks to help save the lives of Ohioans. In the middle of a pandemic, with cases back on the rise in Ohio, this shouldn't have become so political. If you agree that wearing a mask is important and our state's politicians should lead by example, will you chip in to my campaign today? One of the reasons I got into this race is because we need lawmakers in Ohio who have basic common sense, especially on serious issues like health care. It's common sense when you're fighting a virus that can quickly fill up hospital beds and claim the lives of our loved ones that each of us wear a mask in public to slow down the virus and save lives. It's the end of the month, Alex, and my team tells me we're short on our fundraising goal for June, and that we have to place our order for yard signs soon. Can you help? By supporting me in this race you're sending a clear message that it's time to quit the political games and start using common sense. DONATE TODAY Thank you for your support!

More flippable every day. Hi Alex, I want to start this email by giving a huge thank you to the many, many supporters who donated the last couple of weeks and helped us with our filing deadline. Amid health concerns, economic uncertainty and civil unrest, many of you chose to support this campaign and I am grateful. We are proud to say that we had over 7 times the number of individual donors of my opponent, proving once again that Butler County is ready for change and this Senate district is indeed flippable! The last two weeks have shown that Americans, including many, many right here in our communities, are ready for change. The status quo has not worked for many of our citizens and thousands are demanding reform. Ohio needs leaders who will listen, roll up their sleeves and work for that reform. I am in this race because I'm tired of having leaders in Columbus who just play at politics rather than work for the meaningful change citizens are demanding. We need to get back to common sense and putting people over politics. An easy way to show your support for putting people over politics is to pre-order a car magnet with the campaign's new logo. A limited quantity will be ordered, so reserve your magnet today (click the logo to order). Alex, as we roll in to the summer months we appreciate your continued support of our campaign.

Kathy Wyenandt is running for office to serve the people of Butler County, and all of Ohio, with common sense and compassion.

Hello Alex, Over the last decade, more than 1 million New Yorkers have left our state in search of greener pastures. Why? Because New York has become increasingly unaffordable for working families, seniors, and young people just starting out. We pay the highest property taxes in the nation. We have the highest cost of living in the country. We have the worst economic outlook in America. It doesn't have to be that way! At our core, we all want a good paying job to provide for our families, a quality education for our children, access to affordable health care, and a safe neighborhood in which to live. It's why I'm running for State Assembly. We need to restore balance and common sense to state government and focus on the issues that matter most -- affordability, education, jobs and economic opportunity, health care, public safety, and investments in energy and transportation infrastructure. But the only way to do that is to change direction by electing new people to represent us in Albany! It's why I'm asking for your help! Please consider making a donation to my campaign, so that together we can change the direction of New York State! CHIP IN $25 CHIP IN $50 CHIP IN $100 CHIP IN $500 CHIP IN $1,000 My opponent and her supporters are already attacking me because they know our campaign stands in the way of one-party rule in Albany and the socialist agenda they are promoting.

CLICK HERE TO WATCH RAY KELLY'S VIDEO ENDORSEMENT I first met Commissioner Kelly when we both spoke at my Manhattan College graduation -- he as the keynote speaker and me as the Valedictorian. I'm honored to receive his support! Commissioner Kelly is the epitome of what it means to be a public servant, a New Yorker, and a Manhattan College Jasper! ﻿Under his leadership, New York City avoided another terrorist attack, becoming the safest big city in America and saw historic lows in crime. Sadly, those gains are being lost because of the disastrous policies being passed by weak-kneed politicians in Albany and New York City -- all in the name of 'reform'. JOIN THE FIGHT BY MAKING A DONATION TODAY! But we need real reform if we want to address the root problems of inequality and injustice. We need good paying jobs for all New Yorkers; a quality education for every child; access to affordable health care; and safe neighborhoods to live in. As State Assemblyman, I will do the hard work of bringing law enforcement and communities together to address the issues that matter most and ensure justice and equality for all New Yorkers. But I need your help! Tomorrow is the first financial filing deadline of our campaign! Thanks to the strong support of many, we are less than $10,000 away from reaching out goal!

Since launching our campaign in March, we've made tremendous progress: * We are the endorsed candidate on the Republican, Conservative, Independence, and SAM Party lines. * We outraised our opponent by over $100,000 for the July 15th filing. * We are garnering strong support from community leaders, elected officials, and trade unions, and have earned the endorsement of former New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly! But we cannot rest on our laurels -- we have a lot of work to do between now and November! Our opponent and her "progressive" supporters have started attacking our campaign and are advocating for a radical, socialist agenda in New York: X DEFUNDING THE POLICE X MEDICARE FOR ALL X THE GREEN NEW DEAL X ELIMINATING SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL ZONING Their agenda is making New York less affordable, compromising public safety, and hurting working families, seniors, and young people just starting out.

I'm on the ballot to be your voice in Madison! ### Great news! Thanks to the many volunteers in the 31st Assembly District, we've collected almost 500 signatures - more than double the required amount - to be on the ballot in November! I'm a teacher, not a politician. And I will work as hard for you in Madison as I did for the students in my classroom. Now's the hard part - once again, I need your help. We're facing a crucial fundraising deadline on June 30th. We need to close this quarter strong to show special interests and corporate lobbyists in Madison will not silence common sense. I am setting a very ambitious goal, and with your help, I know we can meet it: I want to raise $1,000 online this quarter. If 40 people donate $25 now, we'll meet our goal. Together, we can ensure that Gov. Tony Evers gets a legislature who shares his priorities of ensuring every student has what they need to succeed. Because zip code shouldn't determine educational opportunity or success, and our rural schools are getting left behind. Can I count on you to donate $25 today?

Alex, Day 4 of our Flip PA Tour is complete! Today I drove across from Erie down to the Pittsburgh area and met with future \--- This November, in every corner of our Commonwealth, we need to be electing future legislators who are ready to come to the Pennsylvania State House and put in the work necessary to bring progress and prosperity to the people they represent, and I know that Emily Skopov will be one of those legislators. Emily is in Western Pennsylvania, on the verge of flipping the seat once held by former Speaker of the House Mike Turzai from red to blue for the first time ever, and we can feel the momentum all the way from here! Emily is ready to bring genuine representation to the 28th district and to hit the ground running on day one in Harrisburg with creative common sense solutions. The families of Pennsylvania deserve people fighting for them in the legislature, and that’s why I’m asking you to join me in supporting Emily Skopov today — so that we can get to work for all of you. \--- For too long we have had too many elected officials that put party and politics before people and progress. This November we have an opportunity to elect true public servants all across our Commonwealth, and one of those people is Daniel Smith. Running in the 12th House District in Butler County, I am proud to stand in support of Dan, because I know that Dan is ready to go to Harrisburg and get to work for the people he represents, no matter their political party or background. It is time to close some of this divide, bring our communities together, and send public servants to get the job done — that is why I am asking you to stand with me in support of Daniel Smith today! \--- Lastly, I visited Kolbe Cole in Beaver County. She would be only the second black woman elected in Western PA and we need her voice in Harrisburg. She believes your zip code should not determine the quality of your education because it is crucial we invest in our youth as they are our future leaders. Her district is a one that has been badly gerrymandered, so we really need your help because she’s a fighter and we need her in the PA State House! Tomorrow, I will be headed to the Harrisburg area meeting with some more amazing candidates. Stay tuned for more updates from the road by following me on Twitter @malcolmkenyatta, Instagram @malcolmkenyatta, and Facebook @malcolmkenyatta. Thank you for joining me on this tour to Flip PA!

Dear Friend, I am reaching out because it is a crucial time in Ohio. Alex, Part of the reason I ran for office two years ago was seeing what happens when politicians lose sight of who they are and who they are elected to serve. My view on standing up to corruption was shaped by working for Congressman Jim Jordan, whose willingness to stand up to the “Washington swamp” showed me that one courageous leader can make a difference. Unfortunately, a culture of corruption is now affecting our state legislature. You probably saw the news of Indictments against former Speaker Larry Householder in what’s been called the biggest public corruption case in state history. His actions not only tainted our legislative and political process, but also resulted in a billion dollar corporate bailout that hurts Ohioans. I want to remind you that I opposed Larry Householder for Speaker, and I voted against HB 6 which is at the center of the scandal. At the time, it was considered a political risk for me to do so, but I believe it is more important to have good public policy and integrity in our legislative process than to win short-term favor for myself among power brokers in Columbus. With your continued support, I will take on the culture of corruption in Columbus and stand up for our district. Earning your support instead of relying on funding from PACs and special interests means I will never lose sight of who I am and who I was elected to serve. Your support is very meaningful to me, and I hope I can count on you this election. Your support is more important to me than ever, because Larry Householder’s corruption scandal has put Republicans in danger of losing our House majority to the Democrats. If that happens, we will lose any chance of common sense public policy. DONATE I appreciate your consideration of a generous donation to our campaign, as you have made in the past. With less than 90 days left until election day, it will make a real difference. As always, please let me know if you have any questions, or how I can be of assistance to you.

Thanks to the generosity of amazing friends like you, we met and exceeded our second quarter goal! THANK YOU! ### Alex, thanks to the generosity of friends like you, we met our big second quarter fundraising goal! I knew this campaign would take a lot of resources. I have a target on my back from special interests who want to take me out of politics, and this has been a daunting task. But thanks to the generosity of amazing friends like you, we knocked it out of the park in the second quarter, finishing with over $91,000 on hand! THANK YOU! I promise to do my best to be worthy of your friendship and generosity, by continuing to fight for social justice and the causes that are important to all of us -- like public education, healthcare, jobs, and common sense legislation to keep South Carolinians safe and prosperous. I've taken state government to task in recent days, as the Governor has sought to dictate to school districts the terms of their reopening plans. No doubt we will have many similar debates in the coming weeks as our Covid numbers continue to increase, and families find themselves facing difficult decisions about their children's education, family health and safety, and economic uncertainty. We need thoughtful, practical leadership in times like this, and that is what I seek to provide in the SC House. I can't thank you enough for believing in me and for your kindness and generosity in this campaign. Please help us continue the momentum, if you can, by clicking on the link below.

It’s an especially sad day when we lose a child for any reason, and our state has just lost a child to complications of COVID-19. This week, State Epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell reported our first two cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), a rare but serious COVID-19 related illness. For weeks, South Carolina’s COVID-19 numbers have been surging out of control with over 62,000 cases and roughly 1,000 deaths so far. At the outset of this pandemic, our state was projected to have about 8,000 cases by August. Instead, we’ve seen nearly 15,000 new cases in the last week. Gov. McMaster has consistently refused to take any decisive action to save lives and prevent more South Carolinians from needlessly suffering and dying. But today, he decided to trump State Superintendent Molly Spearman, as well as parents, teachers, business and community leaders and public health experts across SC by scrapping the painstaking work of AccelerateSC and AccelerateED Task Forces. During a joint press conference with House and Senate leaders, he announced that “ALL schools must reopen…for FULL 5 day-a-week IN-PERSON instruction.” So once again, noneducator politicians have made critical, life-changing decisions for front-line educators across SC without their input or any consideration for their well-being. NO statewide mask mandate. NO additional funding. And NO PLAN. As the President aggressively pushes schools across the country to reopen, our Governor chooses to “follow the leader” who politicizes everything from face-masks to ventilators, dismisses his own CDC safety guidelines as “very tough and expensive” and attempts to discredit Dr. Fauci, the science, the data and any other public health experts who challenge his politically-expedient opinions with scientific facts. A decision that has already cost almost 140,000 Americans their lives. According to Gov. McMaster, “we must reopen our economy. People must go back to work.” Who cares if school buildings are poorly ventilated…classrooms are [[URL REDACTED]] are dilapidated…cleaning crews and supplies aren’t guaranteed…students and teachers don’t have room to social distance and PPE, like school supplies, will be relegated to classroom wish lists. Not surprising, since Republican majority leaders have unapologetically defunded our “minimally adequate” public education system for decades. Like SC, Arizona is a COVID-19 hotspot. Three Arizona teachers who recently shared a classroom this summer contracted COVID-19. One of those teachers died. Even before the pandemic, many SC students were already disadvantaged. Take a look at my hometown, Marlboro County (a.k.a. the “Corridor of Shame”), and see for yourself. And if you thought SC teachers were leaving the profession in droves before COVID-19…just wait. Who knew there was so much concern about our students’ mental, emotional and academic health? And where has all that “love” been hiding during budget appropriations? Forcing children back to school so we can force their parents back to “essential” front-line jobs means even more sickness and death…especially in rural, impoverished communities of color where COVID-19 is already wreaking havoc because of decades of systemic health and socio-economic inequities. Sadly, these types of disparities have always been acceptable to the Governor and legislative “leaders” in this “minimally adequate” state. Why can’t we use these obstacles as opportunities to help put all South Carolinians on more equitable footing? Together, we could begin to: • Expand Broadband • Expand Medicaid • Modernize & Fully Fund Public Education • Extend and Enhance Distance Learning Capabilities • Invest in COVID19 safety-compliant Facilities & Transportation Unlike Gov. McMaster and SC House and Senate leaders, I appreciate the hard work and recommendations of our AccelerateSC and AccelerateED Task Forces. Ignoring the science, expert advice and concerns of parents and teachers isn’t leadership. If personal responsibility alone got the job done, SC wouldn’t rank #3 in the world per capita for new COVID-19 cases or #8 in the U.S. for states where people refuse to wear masks. Reopening schools while this virus is raging and spreading exponentially defies science, logic and good old-fashioned common sense. We shouldn’t even think about sending our babies back into the classroom until SC is no longer a world-ranked COVID-19 Petri dish. As we quickly work our way to the #1 spot in the world (per capita) for COVID-19 cases, maybe our Republican “leaders” will stop playing partisan politics with people’s lives and deliberately creating a divisive, false narrative that we can save the economy or save lives, but we can’t do both. Gov. McMaster has unilaterally decided to protect the economy at all costs. If that means endangering the lives of students, teachers, parents, healthcare workers and South Carolina’s most vulnerable, then so be it. False narratives and false choices couldn’t be more reckless, short-sighted, irresponsible and wrong for the people of South Carolina.

Dear Friend, You might wonder what’s at stake during these unprecedented times. As we navigate a rare health crisis, our people and our great American institutions grow increasingly polarized. While it is reasonable for people to disagree over the best methods in a political forum, the grooves in our respective positions have gotten dangerously deep. We must begin to take steps toward constructive solutions and unity to solve our biggest problems together. It’s starts with you and me today. We are ready to restart the economy safely while remaining prudent about the seriousness of the virus. We can safely remain open while practicing appropriate precautions — we must work to safely and swiftly do this. Thousands of area livelihoods, school children and businesses are depending on it. We must gather our strength, our resolve as proud and common sense Pennsylvanians and Americans. We must begin the hard work of rebuilding for the future of our country. Optimism, unity and hard work can overcome many of the toughest obstacles we face as a community and a people. Your help isn’t just important. It’s crucial. It’s why I am counting on you to continue your support of my campaign now more than ever. With your help, I can make sure a commonsense conservative, someone who believes in low taxes, economic growth, and our shared values, wins this seat. We do not need any more of the divisiveness that so many are selling in the public square these [[URL REDACTED]]’s unite around ideas, our common American heritage, and optimism in each other. Please send whatever you can to our cause — whether $5 or $500 — it makes an impact. Let’s unite for our families and children and win this together in November!

Thank you for your interest in State Representative Sandy Salmon's Statehouse News. Is this email not displaying correctly? View it in your browser. ## Capitol Corner email Edition for week ending May 30, 2020 News from the State Capitol from Rep. Sandy Salmon We enjoy hosting visitors from District 63 and from around Iowa: Session Reconvenes This Week I’ll be returning to the Capitol in Des Moines on Wednesday so the Legislature can complete its work for this year’s session. Change our Law &Protect our Freedom – Part 2 In this newsletter I want to recommend other improvements that need to be made to our public health disaster emergency law: Without eliminating legal liability entirely, employers, health care providers, public schools, government agencies or Bill of Rights-protected entities such as churches, private schools, non-profits etc. who are doing the best they can to deal with a public health disaster emergency by implementing health mitigation measures with the knowledge they have should not be subject to legal liability for claims by workers, clients, customers or participants regarding a “lack of protection” in the workplace or church or school, etc. This is simply common sense. We are not talking about employers, schools, hospitals, or churches being negligent, careless, and reckless. We are talking about them doing the best they can but common sense and science tell us that even with the best mitigation measures in place, germs have a way of getting past all that. Government use of drones, microchips, cell phones, and other technology to track citizens without their awareness, to accomplish a goal related to a public health disaster emergency should be prohibited. “Snitching on neighbors”, as is proposed in some states, and which breeds suspicion and distrust, should also be prohibited. Mandatory contact tracing programs which have been proposed in Kansas City, Washington, and other places should be prohibited as well. All are violations of the 4th Amendment right to be secure in your person or property from unreasonable searches and seizures. Governors in other states like New Jersey and Connecticut have proposed or taken action like this with no regard for citizens’ 4th Amendment rights. This is the kind of government activity we see in totalitarian and communist regimes like China and we do not want it here. Mandatory quarantine of healthy people, which has not been used historically, should be prohibited. Mandatory quarantine of sick people who are contagious in an epidemic or even people particularly vulnerable to the epidemic is understandable and has been used in the past as a public health mitigation measure. Also, it is understandable if healthy people who are concerned about contracting a disease, want to stay home of their own free will. Healthy families should not be pulled apart and quarantined separately without their consent, a measure proposed in California and Washington. These activities, which we see proposed in other states, are again a violation of our 4th Amendment right. Total unemployment assistance, no matter what source it is from, state or federal, should not exceed the amount of pay a worker receives on the job. This is likely a federal as well as a state issue, given the federal involvement in unemployment in this pandemic. Otherwise there is no financial incentive to go back to work. And we are on our way to a “guaranteed income”, which is a tenet of socialism and communism, very destructive of freedom, individual dignity, personal responsibility, work incentive, and economic productivity. No hospital or nursing home should deny the request of a patient or their family to visitation by a pastor, priest, etc. Denying a patient fighting for their life or dying in a hospital or nursing home the services of a minister is one of the worst violations of a person’s right to religious freedom. Ministering to souls is just as essential as feeding and medicating bodies. We see people cut off from their ministers in China, North Korea, and other oppressive and tyrannical regimes but we should not see it here. We also need to clarify our law that the medical and religious exemptions for the vaccinations required for school enrollment that are allowed during a normal time are also allowed during a public health disaster emergency. The Dept. of Public Health understands this to be true but the law as written is unclear. So it needs to be clarified. A child’s body does not become physically able to handle a vaccination just because there is a pandemic. If a child needs a medical exemption before a pandemic, he will need it during a pandemic. Also a citizen should not be required to surrender his religious freedom just because there is a pandemic. The Constitution does not allow exemptions to religious freedom for a pandemic. Our Founding Fathers dealt with epidemics in their day and understood the issue of immunity. But they knew that leaving a clear way open for a tyrannical and oppressive government to violate a citizen’s conscience would likely ensure it would eventually do so. I want to bring up another issue for your consideration of which I have been made aware: Until this pandemic I was not aware that our public health disaster emergency law allows the governor to order individuals be vaccinated or possibly be quarantined for an indefinite period of time. In other words, according to our current law, if a vaccine for COVID is developed during the time we are still under a disaster emergency due to the COVID virus and if the governor should order it (not saying she would or is even thinking about it), and if we refused, we could possibly be placed under quarantine until the government allows the quarantine to end. Is this reasonable or is it a violation of our 4th Amendment right to be “secure in your person from unreasonable searches and seizures?” Are the government’s public health and safety concerns paramount here or does the 4th Amendment include the right of a person to determine what goes into their body? Does our law balance these 2 concerns appropriately or is an adjustment needed? No matter your view on this issue, there is no doubt the government should educate the public about the need for a vaccination with full disclosure about its relevant particulars. More needs to be examined and discussed regarding the provision of mandatory vaccination in a disaster emergency, especially in light of issues surrounding vaccinations that have surfaced in recent years and the technology being developed for future vaccinations. More Re-Openings! Governor Reynolds signed a new proclamation continuing the Public Health Disaster Emergency until June 25, 2020. As previously announced, the proclamation permits bars, wineries, breweries, distilleries, and social and fraternal clubs to reopen last Thursday May 28th with the same public health measures in place as restaurants have. The proclamation also permits the reopening on June 1 of additional establishments, including outdoor performance venues, casinos, bowling alleys, amusement parks, skating rinks, skate parks, outdoor playgrounds. The proclamation permits social, community, recreational, leisure, and sporting gatherings and events of more than 10 people if public health measures are implemented, including limiting attendance to 50% of the venue capacity and maintaining six feet of distance between those attending. This also allows practices, games, and competitions for youth and adult baseball, softball, and individual sports such as running, biking, swimming, tennis, and golf to resume with appropriate public health measures in place. New Budget Estimates Released The legislature has requested the Revenue Estimating Conference (REC) meet to provide more information and data about how COVID-19 has impacted the state budget so far. We will use this data next week when the legislature meets to draw up the FY 21 budget. The REC met last Friday to revise their estimates for fiscal years 2020, 2021, and 2022. The meeting was one of the longer meetings in recent memory, as the panel held an extensive discussion on what they envision for state revenue numbers in Fiscal Year 2021. All three members of the REC emphasized that today’s figures were subject to change, based on the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Fiscal Year 2020 – For the current fiscal year, the REC lowered the General Fund forecast. They set the current year’s revenue estimate to $7.9412 billion. The FY 2020 budget set last year with the supplementals approved this year, spends $7.752 billion. This leaves us with a good surplus and full reserve accounts come July 1st. Fiscal Year 2021 – For the next budget year, which will be set in the next couple weeks, the REC new estimate for General Fund revenue is $7.8766 billion. This amount is $360.1 million lower than the March estimate of $8.2367 billion. The new figure is also $64.6 million lower than what the REC set for the revised FY 2020 forecast, which was $7.9412 billion.

Thank you for your interest in State Representative Sandy Salmon's Statehouse News. Is this email not displaying correctly? View it in your browser. ## Capitol Corner email Edition for week ending July 18, 2020 News from the State Capitol from Rep. Sandy Salmon We enjoy hosting visitors from District 63 and from around Iowa: Cedar Valley GOP Candidates At the Meet and Greet event: Black Hawk County Supervisor candidate Brent Dunlop, Iowa House District #60 candidate Ryan Howard, myself, Black Hawk County Sheriff candidate Dan Trelka, and Iowa Senate District #30 candidate Harold Youngblut We Need Intellectual Diversity on University Campus Currently the left, progressive or liberal view predominates on our public university campuses and students get little or no exposure to the conservative view. Furthermore left-leaning faculty are reluctant to expose students to competing perspectives. Administrators are risk averse and prefer campus tranquility even at the cost of avoiding normal debate. This doesn’t look likely to improve in the future if no action is taken. College is the place where students learn and shape their beliefs as they have opportunity to encounter and examine different viewpoints. This is essential to “academic freedom” which colleges all so proudly say they provide and “diversity” which they all say they embrace. Administrators, either dictating which beliefs are permissible or unwilling to take action to ensure students receive exposure to diverse viewpoints is completely contrary to the value of “academic freedom” and “diversity” which are supposed to be part of the mission of our public universities. A 2019 survey of 466 colleges by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) found that 89% had speech codes that ran afoul of the First Amendment. Patrick Garry, University of South Dakota law professor and author of the South Carolina Law Review article “When Legislatures Become the Ally of Academic Freedom” cites a study published in Econ Journal Watch that found Democrats outnumber Republicans 11.5 to 1 on higher education faculties – and that the ratio gets more dramatically skewed the younger the faculty; in departments "where politics may be more relevant, such as history"; and the greater the prestige of the university. More than a third of the 51 colleges surveyed in the study reported no Republicans on faculty at all. Restoring a culture on campus of respectful discussion and debate of diverse viewpoints, which includes the conservative viewpoint, will bolster civility, safeguard liberty, strengthen citizenship, and deepen knowledge. Part of getting a good education is to get exposure to a wide variety of viewpoints, which currently happens too little. The federal government and states are beginning to address this issue of left-leaning bias on university campuses. Just recently, President Trump said he is asking the Treasury Department to look into the tax-exempt status and funding of universities engaging in leftist indoctrination. And in March of last year, the president issued an executive order making federal research funding contingent on universities having adequate free speech protections. With Sen. Joni Ernst Sen. Ernst drove home the critical importance of this year’s election as she updated us at the Meet and Greet on the progress of her campaign. Iowa became one of a number of states in 2019 to enact legislation protecting First Amendment rights on campus. Our law provided common sense protections for the 1st Amendment rights of students and student groups on our Regents university campuses. This clarifies already existing constitutional rights and gives these universities clear guidelines for respecting the rights of students and student groups. Our law: 1. Requires Regents universities to allow 1st Amendment rights of intellectual freedom and free expression 2. Requires that they not shield students from allowed speech even though they disagree or find it offensive 3. Requires them to encourage diversity of thought and respectful exercise of the 1st Amendment 4. Requires them to allow students to assemble and discuss issues subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions 5. Requires them to allow their public forum open to any invited speaker and any lawful expressive activity, thus making the university itself a “free speech” zone as it should be instead of confining free speech to a certain area 6. Requires them to allow any lawful communications not disruptive of the functioning of the college and subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions 7. Requires them to not deny benefits or privileges available to student groups based on the group’s beliefs or based on the group’s requirement that their leadership adhere to their beliefs With these 1st Amendment protections as a foundation, efforts are being made currently to build on them and to go further: legislation which would increase “intellectual diversity” at public universities. Under intellectual diversity laws, not only must dissenting views be tolerated, but college administrations are required to actively take steps to ensure that students are exposed to competing ideological, cultural and political viewpoints. This can be done while respecting academic freedom and without infringing on the autonomy of the classroom. Universities can be required to invite speakers having different viewpoints, especially those poorly represented on campus. This could take the form of a lecture, a debate, or a panel discussion on controversial public policy, cultural, philosophical, or religious issues. Garry concludes that “political indoctrination is not a legitimate academic function and hence is undeserving of special constitutional protection. … Perhaps, as the South Dakota legislature has recognized (South Dakota’s legislature passed a new campus intellectual diversity law), universities may now have to be put under a kind of formalized public review process regarding their actions concerning free speech and academic freedom.” The legislative push for free speech and intellectual diversity on campus reflects “hunger and a momentum among the American people for reform,” Garry said, at a time when the disappointing and ugly results of academic radicalism are already widely evident in the culture at large. State House Candidate Ryan Howard Matt and I are urging support for House District #60 GOP candidate Ryan Howard, pictured with his wife Bruna alongside. American Founders’ Corner I want to take some space in my newsletter to refresh us on the lives and contributions made to America by great Founders whose statues were toppled recently by violent leftist mobs. This week I want to focus on the Founder the rioters love to hate: Christopher Columbus. Although not the first European explorer to touch American soil, his discovery in 1492 of the islands known as the West Indies awakened the West to the Americas, a land that they had not previously known. Armed with his faith in God, an unbelievable amount of steely courage and dogged determination, and a superb talent for navigation and seamanship, Christopher Columbus dared to do what others couldn’t or wouldn’t – and succeeded. That is, he succeeded not in finding a route to the East by going west, but succeeded in finding previously unknown lands we now call America. Many half-truths and lies have made their way into books and other media, some of which are used in schools and universities across the country. They have accused Columbus of being greedy for gold as his primary motivation for his voyages of discovery. His journal and other accounts disprove that accusation. He was motivated by his faith, his desire to open up new trade routes to Asia without having to go eastward, and his hope for economic opportunity to provide for his family and to give to the church. Not to say others weren’t motivated by a greed for gold, but that was not Christopher Columbus’ motivation. Another accusation is that Columbus enslaved and committed genocide against all the natives he found. Records show that the only time Columbus fought against the natives was in defense or when called upon by those natives who were his allies. It is true that he made defeated natives slaves. The other truth is that he found the Native American tribes were conquering, murdering, enslaving, sexually exploiting, and cannibalizing each other into complete extermination. It is also true that Columbus fought against such horrendous and unconscionable practices wherever he could, even liberating groups of enslaved women. Columbus was given charge of some men whom he could not control and they carried out horrible acts of violence which he did not approve or authorize. He was accused of abusing his power and oppressing both his men and the natives but was exonerated of all charges after examination. All of his rights and privileges were restored except for his position as governor. Clearly, he was not good at administration in positions of responsibility located on land. Christopher Columbus was certainly not perfect in all his actions, but he is certainly not deserving of the degradation and condemnation he receives today. He has been acknowledged, appreciated, and honored for his achievements by people from all education levels, all stations in life and all over the world for well over 400 years. I don’t believe we are more “enlightened” today than all these people. Although imperfect, he should continue to be honored today. We need to remember that we enjoy many blessings of America today because of Christopher Columbus. My Happy Place! Feel free to contact me with ideas, thoughts, and concerns.

Alex, Today is the day we’ve waited four years to get here. Today is the day we can choose a new future for our state and for our country. We have 16 seats to flip, including mine, right here in our backyards – in Sandy Springs and North Fulton and in every corner of our state. We've worked hard for months, and I know that when the polls close, we’ll have left it all on the field. This moment calls for nothing less. I’m not a politician willing to do or say anything to win an election. I’m a regular person – your colleague, your neighbor, your friend – who wants to change our state’s political climate and restore some decency, common sense, and progressive thinking to it in the process. If you’re voting in person in Georgia today, take time to confirm your polling place so you know exactly where to go to cast your vote. Or check your nearest absentee ballot drop box to return your ballot by 7 PM tonight. If you’ve already voted, make sure your friends and family have a plan to vote. YOU are the best person to make certain that the people in your life and the people you love are ready to vote for the progress our communities deserve.

2 weeks to go to election day!  View this email in your browser # On Saturday I joined hundreds of our neighbors at the Women’s March in Rochester, one of over 380 sister marches in all 50 states. We safely gathered in Susan B. Anthony Square a month after Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, in opposition to efforts to replace her before the voters have a chance to be heard. We know what’s on the line: the future of safe and legal abortion, gun safety progress, and our healthcare. And that’s why your vote for state legislature has never been more important. As we cast our votes for change on the national stage, it is our state legislators who are the front line in protecting our rights. And that’s why I’m asking for your support and your vote. I will always trust women to make their own decisions about their bodies, advocate for education and job training to help our working families build a better future, and support common sense safety laws. I told the crowd gathered on Saturday, that while it is a sprint to the “finish” of election day on November 3, we must stay on the march of democracy long after this election. I’m proud of our campaign, mentoring leaders new to public service and engaging people across the district, even during a pandemic. Your support has brought us further than we could have imagined, now we need to make sure that every voter is heard on Election Day. Can you chip in to help? Donate! Because on November 3rd, we decide our future! #KeepGoing P.S. I'll be debating my opponent this evening in an online event hosted by Geneseo Votes.

Where are we headed? The U.S. and the world are... View this email in your browser Support Charlie Dear Alex, Where are we headed? The U.S. and the world are just coming out of a terrible pandemic. The disease itself caused tremendous suffering, but the cost of the lockdowns and shutting down the world economy has been devastating. Doctors and scientists are working at a relentless pace to deal with this disease. Revolutionary drugs and exciting and heretofore unimagined therapies will be available soon. Vaccines are being developed using new technologies that can greatly lessen the time for them to become safe and effective. But the economic costs have been staggering. Getting the economy safely going again will require creative thinking. If there is very little risk to getting on with people's lives, the economy can get back to where it was before COVID. Science, the scientific method, and evidence based reasoning should be our guide in reopening the economy. The United States has a difficult decision to make. At some point the government must step back. We need leaders from the medical community who use common sense to guide our country. Where are we headed? Americans have never been afraid of the future. We need leaders who can guide us the though troubled waters. Keeping off the shoals requires constant vigilance. I intend to do just that. That’s why I’m running for Congress.

We are looking to raise an ambitious $5,000 before the end of August and we are looking to you to help us get there. We need to let people know that we support raising teacher pay, college affordability, Medicaid expansion, repealing the sales tax on whole grocery items, and bipartisanship.

View this email in your browser Greetings from the Capitol. I am happy to say that at 3:15 a.m. on Friday we Adjourned, Sine Die, concluding the 111th General Assembly. My colleagues and I have worked tirelessly at the Capitol to make sure we passed a balanced budget that would not raise taxes for Tennesseans, despite the economic hardships COVID-19 has caused. I am proud of the work we have accomplished the past two years in the House of Representatives, and I look forward to the continued progress we will make in the future to ensure Tennessee stays one of the greatest places to live. As Tennessee begins to open back up, I realize that many of my constituents are still struggling to get their Unemployment Benefits. If you are continuing to have issues with your Unemployment account please give my office a call at 615-741-7086 and we will be happy to assist you in order to get your account fixed. Tennessee General Assembly passes $39.45 billion budget Last week in Nashville, both the House and Senate approved a $39.45 billion budget that addresses the unexpected revenue shortfalls caused by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic in Tennessee. The Fiscal Year (FY) 2020-2021 budget reduces the size of government through common sense reductions and cuts totaling $1.5 billion over a two-year period in efforts to address historic revenue losses. The budget finalizes the elimination of the Hall Income Tax and does not raise taxes on Tennesseans. The new state spending plan invests $350 million into Tennessee’s savings account (Rainy Day Fund), bringing the total to $1.45 billion. The budget also fully funds the Basic Education Program (BEP), covering both growth and inflation with a $50.3 million investment. It includes $10.6 million for health insurance and retirement for teachers and principals. The FY 2020-2021 budget supports higher education with a $50 million investment in new facilities. The budget also focuses on boosting consumer and business confidence through the creation of a $25 million sales tax holiday, which will take place over two weekends in late July and early August 2020. Other key allocations include a $210 million grant program for all Tennessee cities and counties. These funds have no restrictions and will be used to address unique needs that are best determined by local and county leaders. Approximately $15 million will be used to support economic and community development through broadband accessibility grants. Finally, the FY 2020-2021 budget invests $19 million to strengthen the state’s health care safety network and $7.5 million in new funding will create a children’s behavioral safety network. Tennessee’s new budget supports citizens across all three grand divisions of our state as they continue to recover from these extraordinary circumstances. Under conservative leadership, the Volunteer State will remain the best place in the entire nation to live, work, raise a family, and retire. House approves Right to Work constitutional amendment House members also approved a resolution adding Tennessee’s Right to Work law to the state constitution. The resolution must pass by a two-thirds majority during the 2021 or 2022 legislative sessions in order to appear on the ballot for a statewide referendum in November 2022. The Right to Work constitutional amendment would also become part of the state constitution if adopted by a majority vote during the 2022 election cycle. Tennessee’s Right to Work statute has been state law since 1947. It stipulates workers cannot be hired or fired based on their membership in, affiliation with, resignation from, or refusal to join or affiliate with any labor union or employee organization. When it was introduced in 1947, supporters of the bill argued it would “be of great advantage to the average member of organized labor.” Right to Work also protects the rights of those who choose not to join a union. Twenty-seven states have Right to Work laws, and nine of those have passed constitutional amendments, including neighboring states Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama. The Alabama amendment passed most recently in 2016. Another neighbor, Virginia, is presently considering repealing its Right to Work statute. A constitutional amendment would offer greater protection for workers against such repeal efforts. House members remain committed to support Tennessee’s workers and businesses. House members pass drug-free zone reform House members last week also passed legislation reforming drug-free zone laws currently on the books. House Bill 2517 passed by an 88-4 vote on June 17, 2020. The measure right-sizes drug-free zones from 1,000 feet to 500 feet and strengthens penalties against those who sell drugs to children within these zones. At the same time, the legislation allows for a judge to use discretion and apply more appropriate sentencing in certain instances. Drug-free zones include public or private elementary, middle, secondary schools, child care agencies public libraries, recreational centers and parks. By shrinking these zones, House Bill 2517 has the potential to create additional resources to make justice more efficient in our state. House Bill 2517 now heads the governor’s desk for his signature.

The majority party at the state legislature is fighting tooth and nail to line their allies' pockets while leaving Oklahomans... View this email in your browser , Service is very important to me. It is the duty of every citizen to give back in whatever way we can. It is certainly the duty of every elected official to give back to citizens. The mission of our state legislature is to improve the lives of constituents by listening to the people and providing leadership on how best to address the issues of the day. The majority at the state legislature has failed this mission. Year after year we see hospital closures in rural Oklahoma because of neglect at the Capitol. The majority would rather pander to their base with irresponsible tax cuts, unconstitutional legislation, and spending cuts that leave Oklahomans struggling. If you believe in electing legislators who truly serve the people, I hope you will consider making a donation of $10, $25, $50, $100 or whatever you can today! In the ten years they've been in power, the Republican majority fought tooth-and-nail against common sense solutions that would properly fund our core services. We see the impact of their neglect every day, and the voters of Senate District 21 are ready for a change. I'm stepping up to be that change, . I humbly ask that you make a donation to my campaign as we fight not only to undo the damage caused by these irresponsible budget cuts - but to give back to our fellow Oklahomans by fully funding our core services and protecting our rural hospitals. By making a generous donation to this campaign, we will take this fight to the Capitol and finally start giving back to the people.

View this email in your browser Dear Alex, Today, my opponent attacked me for my endorsement from Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition (TIRRC) Votes, an organization that does important work to build power amongst our immigrant and refugee communities in Tennessee to advocate for equitable policy around immigrant rights. My opponent claims that TIRRC Votes "encourages illegal immigration" and that I'm "pick[ing] and choos[ing] the laws to enforce." My opponent must not know government 101. The job of a state representative is not to enforce the law but rather to write legislation that benefits our community so that we can reach our full potential. We are a country of immigrants. I became a citizen thanks to the help of a Republican legislator, Senator Fred Thompson, a true statesman. I know firsthand the impact legislation has on everyday people - my family has lived it. TIRRC Votes works on building common ground to help our state achieve its full potential. They endorse candidates on both sides of the aisle and I am proud to be one of them. I look forward to uniting Republicans, Democrats, and Independents behind common sense solutions, like in-state college tuition for our Tennessee high school DREAMers, which has bipartisan support. While my opponent seeks only to divide us with these xenophobic attacks, I am working hard to unite our district and find common ground across party lines. I need your help to reach out to voters so they can hear what we're really about. Can you pitch in $20, $40, or $100 today to help us speak to the people of District 97?

Assemblyman Byrne's Monthly E-Newsletter w/ special updates on COVID-19 and other state related news #TheByrneNotice #Byrne4NY #OnTheJob View this email in your browser Assemblyman Byrne with wife Briana and their first born child, Braeden Vincent Byrne In case you haven't been following, a lot happened this past month and a half. For starters, our Byrne Clan was blessed with the new addition of Braeden Vincent Byrne on May 18, 2020. Sadly, three days later, we were also forced to say goodbye to everyone's favorite four-legged member of our family, Tracker, due to a terminal diagnosis of acute leukemia. It pained us immensely to say goodbye, but Bri and I are glad Tracker was able to meet Braeden before he went to his final vet appointment and crossed the rainbow bridge. At a time when so many of us have been forced to live a more isolated life, Braeden has lit up our world. He definitely keeps Bri and me on our toes and while we are often sleep deprived, he's nothing short of amazing. In other news, after months of effort by my colleagues in the Assembly, Governor Cuomo finally began to open up portions of our state's economy and business. Now in Phase 3 in the Mid-Hudson Economic Development Region, we are seeing more businesses re-open, but with additional safety restrictions. That said, there is a continued frustration with Albany as we witness one man make all the decisions and literally decide which businesses or causes are worthy enough to operate and be heard in this state. Emergency powers have an important function to better manage a declared disaster and while these powers are not unlimited, they are vast. Still, this type of power should not be granted to any one individual longer than absolutely necessary. As of right now, this is already the longest declared disaster recorded in our state's history. In early June, the NYS Legislature met and passed hundreds of pieces of legislation, five of which were bills I introduced to assist our region. That brings the total number of bills I passed in the Assembly since being elected to 19 (still more than most Assembly members with the same length of service, regardless of party affiliation). In doing so the Legislature also demonstrated that it can continue to conduct the people's work safely during this pandemic. Knowing this, it seems clear that the declaration by the governor, along with the emergency powers granted to him, is no longer necessary and should be suspended. The governor will continue to have significant powers as our state's top executive, and with increased collaboration with our state's legislative representatives, should be able to safely manage the existing public health challenges caused by COVID-19. People have already been forced to sacrifice so much: employment, family time, properly mourning the loss of a loved one, and even prayer at houses of worship. Now we are seeing increased tensions due to the murder of George Floyd. There is no question that racial injustice, hate, and bigotry still exist in this country, but it's wrong and unfair to suggest it is the norm or in any way "mainstream." Racial disparities are clearly visible when viewing outcomes from our education, healthcare, criminal justice, and failed public housing systems. That said, I continue to believe that people by an overwhelming majority are kind and caring; just look at how we came together earlier this year to slow the spread of COVID-19. The state legislature did pass some important measures to improve our criminal justice system. Some I supported and others I opposed because, like the disastrous bail "reform," it simply went too far and tilted the scales of justice unfairly towards criminals at the expense of those who choose to obey the law. The hate and anger we've seen in recent weeks can often bring out the worst in people. Look no further at how our men and women in law enforcement have been shamed and demonized for the actions of a murderer in Minneapolis. Placing unfounded blame on police in general is not only unfair, it's dangerous. Calls to "Defund the Police" and "Blue Lives Murder" instills fear in people and unfairly labels all these brave men and women as either bad actors or criminals, even though only weeks earlier they were lauded as our "Front Line Heroes" by many of the same people. If we truly want to have a meaningful conversation about reform, then all parties need to be at the table including law enforcement. Black lives do matter, and blue lives matter too. It is not one or the other. It's both, because every life does matter. I will not apologize for saying so. I also support every citizen's first amendment right to peacefully assemble, but we must also remain mindful of what we've continuously heard from public health experts about avoiding mass gatherings to protect our fellow New Yorkers from COVID-19. Our constitutional rights are afforded to all our people and must be applied equally, not just to causes we may support - an important point I made in an OpEd published earlier this month in the New York Post. If politicians like Mayor Bill De Blasio believe the standard has changed for protesters within the BLM movement, then that standard to express one's right to peacefully assemble should be the same for all others, including those who want to pray in houses of worship. As we continue to navigate through these challenging times I thank you for your continued trust in me. The start of our campaign has been hindered from the virus but we've continued to go strong by engaging the community in more creative ways. Despite the challenges before us, we also continue to rack up endorsements from organizations such as: Teamsters No. 456, Utility Workers Union of America Local 1-2, Law Enforcement Employees Benevolent Association, in addition to supportive words of encouragement from organizations like the New York State Physician Assistants Association. Not to worry, we're just getting started. With gratitude always, Kevin M. Byrne Ranking Member of Committee on Health Chair of Assembly Minority Program Committee New York's 94th Assembly District New Endorsements Upcoming Activities In The News... ## PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS SHOW SUPPORT FOR BYRNE In the Letter of Support issued to Assemblyman Byrne, Maureen C. Regan, MBA, PA-C, FACHE, DFAAPA, President of NYSSPA and Delegate of the AAPA wrote, “On behalf of the Board of the NYS Society of PAs I am pleased to offer this Letter of Support as you run for re-election for the 94th Assembly District in NY. As a new generation leader in the Assembly your commitment to and advocacy of the PA Profession and the patients of NYS we serve is greatly appreciated. As the Ranking Member of the Assembly Health Committee your voice regarding quality, accessible and financially responsible healthcare in NY and your appreciation of the role PAs play in all of these metrics is self-evident. As past Ranking Member of the Assembly Aging Committee you also have a deep appreciation of the role PAs play in taking care of this very vulnerable population, whether it be in a longterm care facility or in their home should they desire to age in place. Your very vocal support of NYSSPAs MOLST Bill will allow PAs to have necessary conversations with our patients as part of well established relationships. Your stewardship and voice of reason during the recent public health issues in NYS is also greatly appreciated, a voice relying on facts and common sense.” Read more HERE ## BYRNE STANDS FIRM WITH FIRST RESPONDERS Keith Olson, President of Westchester County Affiliated Police Associations – “Lessons learned from the disaster caused by the rushed bail reform and discovery laws have been sadly lost on our Democratic legislators. The repeal of Civil Rights Law 50-a was done hastily and unfairly. While our Democratic lawmakers fight for the rights of known criminals, they simultaneously attack the rights of police officers. I am sad to say that far too many of them have lost their way. On behalf of the nearly 5,000 members of the Affiliated Police Associations of Westchester, I want to thank Assemblyman Kevin Byrne for voting NO for the repeal of 50-a, for his commitment to law enforcement and for standing on the right side of law and order.” Mike Essig, President of the New York State Fraternal Order of Police – “New York State Fraternal Order of Police would like to thank Assemblyman Byrne for voting NO to repeal 50-a and thank him for his commitment to law enforcement in his community. The repeal of 50-a is akin to informing a jury of prior allegations or even convictions of an individual who is alleged to have committed an act. This past information would have no bearing on current allegations. By doing so, you are stripping public servants of the same rights and due process afforded to all.” Neil Pellone, President of Westchester County Corrections Officers Benevolent Association – “The tragic murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis was a horrific act that should have never happened. While the need for reform is apparent, true reform results from thoughtful deliberation and careful considerations that lead to lasting change. Knee jerk reactions do not serve the public interest. The repeal of 50-a was done in haste and without meaningful input from the men and women in law enforcement. The need for public transparency should not come at the expense of the safety of an officer or his or her family who are also your constituents.” Read more HERE ## Byrne OpEd: High Horse Politicians Do About Face on Coronavirus Published in the New York Post “For months we’ve been told by CDC, the state Department of Health and Gov. Andrew Cuomo that we need to think about how our decisions affect the health and safety of others. That it’s insensitive and reckless to go out in groups because of how it would exacerbate the spread of COVID-19, overwhelm the health care system and kill our fellow New Yorkers. We were told we could not observe Memorial Day the way we want, pray in houses of worship as we like, shop or visit family. Thousands of New Yorkers have had to say good-bye to their loved ones without a proper wake or funeral. New Yorkers dutifully complied, even at the expense of heavy economic and emotional pain. Remember when Cuomo blasted a Long Island rally that attracted scores of protesters, arguing that everyone has a right to express their opinion — but not by violating rules that protect society as a whole? “You want to jeopardize your health? God bless you,” Cuomo said. “You have no right to jeopardize my health . . . and my children’s health and your children’s health.” What changed? I fully support a person’s First Amendment rights, including a person’s right to peacefully assemble. Our constitutional freedoms are the first line of defense against a tyrannical government. That has not changed, and we should all be grateful for those rights every day we wake up." What changed is the response from attention-seeking politicians who crave the spotlight. In the blink of an eye, they’ve gone from chastising peaceful protesters and using law enforcement to enforce strict social-distancing guidelines to encouraging mass gatherings and even posing for pictures with protesters in large groups (sometimes without even a mask). Here is a message to elected officials and public-health experts: Either open everything up or be consistent and practice what you preach. Many of the same officials who lobbied to close all state parks, close trail heads, close businesses and shut down vast portions of our state’s economy are now throwing away all those sacrifices they requested from us. Some demonstrations have done a better job attempting to adhere to social distancing, but many simply threw Matilda’s Law right in the trash without objection from elected leaders. How many thousands of nursing-home residents died right here in New York because of the DOH’s misguided order mandating these facilities to take COVID-19 patients? Would protests against that order have been welcomed at that time? Suicide takes the lives of 22 military veterans each and every day. Does that meet their standard? Politicians should not get to choose whose cause is more righteous and worthy. Don’t get me wrong — I’m infuriated by what I saw on that video, and our nation has come together in unison to condemn the brutal act of hate against George Floyd. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: “Based on what we’ve seen and know at this time, I believe it was murder, and I fully expect the perpetrator of Floyd’s death will be brought to justice.” We need to do more to respect, listen and appreciate one another as human beings, regardless of what may make us different as individuals. Every law enforcement officer I’ve spoken with is equally disgusted and agrees. Still, there are other, safer and more responsible, ways to voice our anger about the death of George Floyd. I have not personally attended any mass gatherings because I choose not to risk exposing or spreading the virus by attending. Mask or no mask, if you’re in close proximity yelling, hugging and posing for photos in large groups of 100 or more, health professionals have made it crystal clear that it’s not safe nor responsible. It goes against everything we’ve been told and everything public officials have been preaching. Then again, if that’s not true, then what the heck are we waiting for? Open up New York!" Read in the New York Post HERE ## BYRNE PASSES RESOLUTION TO PROCLAIM PREGNANCY & INFANT LOSS REMEMBRANCE DAY IN NEW YORK Assemblyman Kevin Byrne (R,C,Ref-Mahopac) is pleased to announce the resolution he introduced to proclaim October 15, 2020 as Pregnancy & Infant Loss Remembrance Day in the state of New York has passed the Assembly unanimously. Sadly, over 26,000 babies are stillborn every year in the U.S., which equals 1 in every 160 pregnancies, or 70 babies (a school bus full of children) every day. Byrne was careful to point out that while this issue has affected members of his family and those he is close to, he has also learned this tragic loss of life has a disproportionate impact on minority communities in our state, especially the black community. “I cannot imagine the hurt and pain these families must go through from losing their child,” said Byrne. “My heart and prayers go out to them all. I would like to give special thanks to my colleague from Brooklyn, Assembly member Rodneyse Bichotte, for sharing her powerful story during session and supporting this resolution. It is my sincere hope this resolution will give greater recognition to this important cause and help raise awareness about stillbirth so we can do a better job of addressing this pressing public health issue in our state.” Read more HERE ## GOVERNOR’S POWER AMID PANDEMIC STILL UNCHECKED AS LEGISLATIVE REFORM IS SHOT DOWN BY ONE-PARTY RULE Gary Varvel/Indinapolis Star/[[URL REDACTED]] “While I have been careful to recognize and thank the governor for some of the decisive actions he took earlier in this pandemic, it is unhealthy for our state and democracy to allow one person, unchecked, to dictate all policy making,” said Byrne. “According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) website, the COVID-19 disaster declaration is by far the longest recorded in our state’s history dating back to 1950. While there is an important reason why the executive rightfully possesses some emergency powers during a declared disaster, the magnitude of that power, while not unlimited, is vast and should not be prolonged longer than absolutely necessary. The people of this great state live under a representative state government. It is vital that the Legislature reassert itself as a fully functioning co-equal branch of government and restore checks and balances as intended by our state constitution. It’s not enough, nor is it acceptable, to simply sit on the sideline as we watch one official make nearly all the policy decisions. More recently, the governor has begun to overreach with his disaster powers by unilaterally launching long-term changes highlighting the need to “re-imagine education.” These types of long-term changes are not directly tied to the present crisis and should be properly vetted and discussed by the Legislature.” Read more HERE ## BYRNE JOINS ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUES TO ENSURE DEATH BENEFITS GET TO FAMILIES OF MUNICIPAL FRONT-LINE WORKERS “Despite increased risk to their own health and safety, our front line workers continue to answer the call to serve. Many of the residents of Westchester & Putnam continue to work in New York City and the surrounding areas as emergency first responders. It has been reported that the FDNY EMS already lost five of their own members to this awful virus, and it’s only right their loss be appropriately recognized for what it is: a line of duty death. Nothing can bring back a person who has died from COVID-19, but we can help by having their deaths classified appropriately to better assist their families in getting the benefits they deserve,” said Byrne. “I’d like to thank the sponsor, Government Employees Committee Chairman Assemblyman Peter Abbate for introducing this legislation. The language in this legislation covers a large list of public employees who deserve these benefits, but I am especially grateful to see it will now ensure that these benefits are afforded to the families of our emergency first responders who died from the virus they were exposed to while caring for patients during the pandemic.” Read more HERE ## NEW YORKERS CAN’T AFFORD TO IGNORE DENTAL HEALTH Photo by Andrea Piacquadio from Pexels “Dentists are among the very few medical professionals who have not yet been allowed to care for their patients, except in emergency situations,” said Byrne. “Patients need their dental health needs addressed before those needs do in fact become emergencies. Dentists already have a very high threshold of training before they are able to practice in this state, and with stringent guidelines, their profession maintains some of the highest levels of safety in using personal protective equipment. According to a recent update on the NYSDA website, “NYSDA is strongly advocating with the Governor and the Department of Health for dental offices to return to full service as quickly as possible. We have communicated our position to both the Governor and the Department of Health and we will press our argument, not just for the benefit of dentists, but also for the patients they serve.” Read more HERE ## ASSEMBLY MINORITY CONFERENCE CALLS FOR LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS ON COVID-19 PANDEMIC’S IMPACT ON NURSING HOMES “The threat of an outbreak in adult-care facilities was evident early, and the state’s policies placing patients and staff in harm’s way reek of negligence. This is wholly unacceptable,” said Assemblyman Kevin Byrne (R,C,Ref-Mahopac), Minority Ranker on the Committee on Health. “Sadly, last week, 1,700 new COVID-19 nursing home deaths were added to the state’s total, including dozens of military veterans living in state-run facilities. The Legislature has announced a hearing on the Federal Response to Economic Effects of COVID-19; however, the Committees on Health, Aging, Veterans and Investigations have not been included. Relying solely on the state attorney general’s investigation into nursing homes is a mistake and ignores the inherent bias the state has toward itself. In the interest of openness and transparency, the Legislature owes New Yorkers a hearing into this mess. These aren’t just statistics, these were people’s mothers, fathers, grandmothers and uncles. We demand an explanation; families deserve answers.” Read more HERE ## BYRNE: DON’T PUNISH OUT-OF-STATE HEALTHCARE WORKERS WHO ANSWERED OUR PLEA FOR HELP Photo by Павел Сорокин from Pexels “These brave men and women have come to our state to bolster our healthcare capacity and aid our state’s residents at a time when we needed them most,” said Byrne. “While they are rightfully compensated for their hard work, in some ways they should be viewed in a similar light as the brave men and women of our military who also answered the call to duty to support New York during this awful pandemic. These heroes deserve our thanks and praise. What they don’t deserve is to be punished and forced to open their wallets to pay New York’s state income tax. While our state remains in a difficult fiscal situation, it is at no fault of these brave and generous professionals. The overwhelming majority of these workers would not be here caring for our residents if not for the pandemic and New York’s plea for assistance.” Read more HERE # #OnTheJob ## In and Around the 94th More Photos On Facebook Delivering hand sanitizer to our first responders in #Yorktown!
