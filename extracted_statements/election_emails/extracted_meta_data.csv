"When Democrats Turn Out Alex, Has Mitch McConnell been living under a rock? The House Majority Leader has refused to support more emergency relief for Americans, saying he hasn’t “felt the urgency” to take action. Luckily, America has a progressive champion who’ll help him feel it. A May 11 tweet from @ewarren reads, ""More than 80,000 people are dead, Senator. Is there a number that would make this more urgent for you?"" Warren's tweet is in response to an article tweeted from @thehill, also on May 11, with the headline: ""McConnell said there isn't need yet for fifth coronavirus relief bill: 'I don't think we have felt the urgency of acting immediately'"" [[URL REDACTED]] Source: Twitter Warren’s spirited defense of common sense and common decency drew one Twitter user to declare, “We need Elizabeth Warren as vice president.

"When Democrats Turn Out Alex, In a dangerous polling shift, Democratic Representative Xochitl Torres Small \-- one of our endorsed candidates \-- has just had her race in New Mexico’s 2nd congressional district moved from “tilt Democrat” to “toss-up,” according to Inside Elections. In 2016, Representative Torres Small flipped the historically red district by fewer than 4,000 votes \-- making history while helping Democrats take back the House. Since then, she has led with the mantra that “common sense solutions don’t come with a party label” \-- and she’s now working to protect her seat and block the GOP’s full-fledged efforts to flip New Mexico red. But AP News has reported that Rep. Torres Small’s Trump-endorsed opponent, Yvette Herrell, had “one of the biggest fundraising quarters for a Republican congressional candidate in state history” after calling on Donald Trump and his Republican loyalists to campaign for her \-- and state numbers show that Republican voter registration is outpacing Democrats in the district by more than twice the margin of victory in 2018. Democrats have warned us that this presidential election could be decided in the House if Donald Trump decides to contest election results and if voter turnout is low. Despite our Democratic House majority, Republicans hold a majority of state delegations in the House. We cannot afford to lose any Democratic seats \-- that’s why we’re mobilizing to provide crucial support to Rep. Xochitl Torres Small’s campaign in the last stretch of the election. We’re aiming to raise $5,000 by TONIGHT to help Rep. Xochitl Torres Small overcome the GOP’s targeted smear ads against her, reach the voters she needs to win, and protect the Democratic House majority. You more than anyone know that the fight against Republican tyranny must be a collective effort. Small-dollar donations are known to be the driving force in tight race victories; will you pitch in $10, $25, $50, or anything you can today to help us reach our goal and protect Rep. Torres Small’s crucial Democratic seat? With your help, we’ll protect and expand our House majority and exile Trump’s far-right agenda from power.

"We've done a lot here -- and we can do more together. Inslee Friend, Too many days mark tragic anniversaries. Today is one. Two years ago today, a gunman walked into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida and used a semi-automatic rifle to murder 17 people and wound 17 others. It remains one of the deadliest school shootings in the history of this country. And since then, Republicans in the Senate and President Donald Trump have done NOTHING to prevent more tragedies like it. But here in Washington state we are doing all we can to put an end to gun violence. This year I'm joining with Washington state's Attorney General Bob Ferguson to push for legislation that limits magazine capacity and bans the sale of assault weapons. Weapons of war do not belong on our streets and in our schools. We've made huge progress in the last few years to prevent gun violence -- but there's more we can do here. That's why I'm asking you to join me and the Washington Alliance for Gun Responsibility in calling on Washington state lawmakers to pass HB 2240/SB 6077, which limits high capacity magazines: Contact your legislator today and tell them to vote yes on these important bills to keep Washingtonians safe from gun violence today. CONTACT YOUR LEGISLATORS I'm proud of the work we've done in Washington state to reduce gun violence. Last year, we put a ban on ghost guns -- which are especially dangerous because they are made with 3-D printers and can go undetected by scanners. And in October, Seattle investigators removed a cache of firearms from a man believed to be a leader of the most violent extremist group in the country. They were able to do so thanks to the state's red flag law, passed by ballot initiative in 2016. But that's not enough: We need to pass HB 2240/SB 6077 and prohibit magazines that can carry more than 10 rounds of ammunition. This is a common sense measure that will save lives. We should be making it harder for those who want to inflict mass violence and destruction upon innocent people. And by limiting magazine capacity and banning assault weapons, we can work toward a day where no one in Washington state loses friends or family members to senseless gun violence. If you agree: Join me and the Washington Alliance for Gun Responsibility to tell Washington state lawmakers to pass HB 2240/SB 6077 and limit high capacity magazines on guns here to save lives.

"Susan Wagle for Senate Alex -- We are in tough times. I hope you and your family are staying safe. All of us have a role to play right now by staying home as much as possible, practicing social distancing and taking care of each other. Because of this, I have paused my in person campaign activity. My campaign is focusing on online events and tele town halls to reach out to voters. Tough times call for tough leadership. Despite pressure, I kept the Kansas legislature open so that we could finish our work safely. Kansans need certainty, and we could not leave town without first passing a budget. My opponent, state Senator Barbara Bollier, criticized me for my actions and actually advocated on the Senate floor for us to end session and allow unelected administrative staff to make decisions. The recent actions of congressional Democrats shows why it is so important to keep this seat Republican and with it the Senate majority in GOP hands. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put forth a stimulus plan that our workers, small businesses and farmers desperately need. But Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer delayed and distracted to advance their radical agenda like implementing their Green New Deal, rigging elections to benefit them and giving more money to Planned Parenthood. Thankfully, President Trump and Senator McConnell hung tough and won the day. Imagine how bad the outcome would have been if the Republicans didn’t have the Senate majority. We need to protect the Senate majority in November. In order to do this, Republicans in Kansas need to make the tough choice of who best to beat Barbara Bollier. I serve with Barbara in the Kansas Senate. I have a record taking her on, debating her and winning. I will do it again in November. While campaigning is now different, it does not end. Now is not the time to hold fundraising events. As a result, we are short of our fundraising goal for the quarter. I’m asking you to help out by making a donation in the safest manner possible today.

"Alex -- The fight against socialism in Washington rages on.

"Susan Wagle for Senate Alex -- America is in crisis as we combat a global public health pandemic. We are now being required to stay home to slow the spread of the coronavirus. As a result, our workers are being laid off and our small businesses are literally being forced to close their doors. Through very difficult times, I led the Kansas legislature to stay open and quickly do the people’s business by passing a budget before adjourning early so our leaders were able to go home and stay safe. This is exactly the type of leadership needed in Washington to put an end to the insanity going on in Congress today. Our workers and small businesses need help now. If ever there was a time for Congress to drop the partisanship and act in the interest of the American people, this is it. The Senate Republicans put forth a plan that would provide immediate financial support to laid off workers, help small businesses stay open and keep people employed. It will also provide support for devastated industries we will need to get our economy back on track when this is over. The plan provides resources and support for hospitals and medical professionals who are the front lines combating this pandemic. What are the Democrats doing? Slowing down progress to force upon us parts of their radical Green New Deal. A Democratic operative once remarked, “Never let a good crisis go to waste.” Speaker Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer are taking this to a disgraceful ending by blocking the much-needed stimulus package.  We can’t let that happen. I’m deeply concerned about the massive debt we are saddling with our children. But in the short term, I’m more interested in slowing the spread of the coronavirus and getting our economy jump started. I also want to quickly reach a point where people can return to work while we protect those most vulnerable. In order to do this, we all need to do our part in this 15-day period. The least the Democrats in Congress can do is put aside their own self-interests and vote for American workers and small businesses. Join me in praying for our medical professionals and that wisdom and common sense will be restored to Congress. P.S.

"Fines don't stop people from trying again, they just put a price on exploitation. Dear Alex, I wrote to you yesterday about the U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday filing a landmark lawsuit against Google that accuses the tech giant of illegally holding monopolies in search and search advertising. This filing is a culmination of a more than yearlong investigation into alleged anticompetitive practices at the company, and the first such antitrust case in the tech world in decades. Shahid, reacting to someone online Shadow Congress has the ability to act. One of the most important things Congress could do when legislating new antitrust laws is to statutorily enshrine—and expand—the essential facilities doctrine. It was cited to break up AT&T, and also to require railroad companies to share access to bridges crossing major rivers. It recognizes affirmative obligations on companies whose control over essential infrastructure could easily constrain competition. While judicially created to constrain monopolies, the doctrine has fallen out of favor as the right-wing took over our courts. One shape that the essential facilities doctrine could take if statutorily enshrined and forced into the courts would be to mandate interoperability: requiring companies to allow users of their platforms to not only download their data, but also to receive it in formats that would allow them to easily migrate to competing platforms. Such a requirement would radically empower Internet users while putting big tech firms in their place. Another key principle in strengthening antitrust enforcement of tech companies is recognizing—in the legal code since courts have declined to acknowledge—that harms to consumers can include eroding privacy protections or service standards, not just price inflation. At the moment, federal regulators are effectively blinded to harms to competition and consumers stemming from nominally “free” services. How can a consumer be harmed if a product is free? Companies in the online advertising industry (including every major social media platform) treat users not as consumers, but as products—but the law currently doesn’t not recognize that. This is an easy fix that no one in Congress seems to understand—perhaps because many Members of Congress, including the Speaker of the House, were first elected before the Internet was developed, know little about regulating it, and don't shown up for public debates to prove their competence. Luis Arce, winner of the 2020 Bolivian presidential election and member of the Movement for Socialism party, waves to a crowd amongst a cloud of confetti. Shadow Legislating the recognition that harms to competition can inhere in the erosion of privacy, in particular, would represent a mandate for federal regulators to pursue antitrust remedies against companies like Facebook, who have repeatedly—and arbitrarily—changed their terms of service. Recognizing harms to consumers in eroding service standards could also help provide an additional legal bulwark to protect net neutrality from Internet Service Providers wielding local monopolies. Another way tech companies have abused users—and the Internet—is by acquiring their competitors to prevent competition. But regulators allow too many problematic mergers. Legislation to require regulators to apply more exacting scrutiny, and to allow some manner of public participation in potential settlements, is long overdue. These are common sense measures demanded by the public. But until we change the occupants of a few seats in Congress, we can rest assured that tech companies will continue to run circles around regulators, the Internet, and the public.

"no one should have to pay rent during a pandemic Alex, A pandemic is bad enough, but now it’s put many Americans out of work—and rent is due. Fortunately, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D—MN) has proposed an elegant solution. Her bill, H.R. 6515, is titled the Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act. Introduced in April and cosponsored by the rest of the Squad as well as many renters’ organizations, H.R. 6515 would establish a national relief fund to pay landlords their rent, and mortgage banks their home payments. No one would have to return to work when it’s dangerous, or risk eviction. Can you chip in today and help us win so renters can get a fair shake from Congress during tough and unpredictable times? So what happened to it? The bill is being stonewalled by corporate Democrats in the House, led by House Speaker—and wealthy landlord—Nancy Pelosi. Her priorities are ridiculous, as well as offensive. Congress has found money for Trump’s surveillance, for militarized DHS thugs, for a bloated & fraudulent war budget, and for endless corporate bailouts—but not for renters during a pandemic and recession. Once I’m in Congress, we’ll join this bill as a cosponsor and make San Francisco’s voice on it a loud and clear “yes.” New voices are needed in Congress that represent working people, instead of corporations & banks. Can you make a donation today so we can turn the “Squad” into a Platoon? Ensuring that voters don’t go homeless during a catastrophe shouldn’t be a partisan or ideological issue. Like funding firefighters, it’s simple common sense. Thanks for standing with us on the right side of history. We’re proud to stand with you. Shahid Want to give now?

"Team, I think we can all agree: dark money in politics corrupts and erodes our democratic system. As you read this, super PACs are stockpiling money to pour into races like mine with the explicit purpose of drowning out the voices of constituents and citizens in favor of large private interests. I’m so proud that my campaign is fueled by individuals chipping in what they can because they believe in our movement. Unlike our Republican counterparts who are saddling up with corporate super PACs to help them win Trump’s favor, I have not and will not accept a single dime of corporate PAC money. That’s why I’m excited to have earned the endorsement of End Citizens United, the foremost organization dedicated to getting dark money out of politics.

Sri’s message is catching fire, team. Houston families are tired of political grandstanding and do-nothing representation. While our opponents compete in a race to the far right, Sri is focused on helping the community now and bringing common sense solutions that work for Texans to DC. We will win this election if we’re able to provide voters with the information they need to safely cast their ballots.

"Hi team, COVID-19 cases are skyrocketing in our country because so many of our leaders have failed to put Americans’ health first. Like Sen. John Cornyn: He’s been skipping meetings with nurses working on the front lines and picking pointless fights on Twitter. It’s clear he is not the leader Texas -- or America -- needs. But there’s good news. MJ Hegar is ready to show Sen. Cornyn the door. Will you please pitch in now to help her bring some common sense to the Senate? MJ is a fellow veteran, someone who showed her commitment to this country by serving in uniform. As a combat search and rescue pilot, she faced life and death decisions every day. MJ earned a Purple Heart and a Distinguished Flying Cross with Valor for her bravery and quick action in the face of danger -- so I know that in the Senate she’ll always rise to the moment to protect Texans. Will you please pitch in to help her get there? Look, MJ needs our help to win this race. Sen. Cornyn has been playing political games for 18 years, and now his Washington allies -- from Donald Trump, Jr. to the Koch network -- are paying him back. Sen. Cornyn has a $14.5 million war chest to spend on his reelection! Politicians like Mitch McConnell and his right-hand man Sen. Cornyn have made it absolutely clear they’re not willing to put the well-being of our country and our people over their political agendas. I believe this country is better than that, that Texans are downright tired of Sen. Cornyn being a politician rather than a leader, and that’s why I believe in MJ. Will you join me in supporting MJ right now? Let’s send a real leader for Texas to the Senate. Leadership doesn’t come from a title, it comes from action. MJ and I are counting on you. Thank you, Pete Buttigieg DONATE It's clear we need a real leader for Texas and a Senate that prioritizes our health care.

Dear friend, With the election coming up quickly, I want to reach out and ask if you can donate to a candidate for U.S. Congress that I have known and worked with for more than 15 years, Stephen Daniel. During our time working together, I have been consistently impressed by his integrity, hard work and commitment to helping others. From fighting for justice for his clients to serving as a steward for his community, Stephen is one of the best we have. Stephen is emblematic of the common sense that we need to restore in Washington. He approaches every problem with a level head and works to find the best solution for everyone, not himself. He follows his moral compass, not the whims of whatever is easiest. He never ceases to do right by his clients, his family or his friends, and that’s what makes him a good man. Stephen is running in Texas's 6th Congressional District. This is a district we can win this year and I need your help to get it on the radar of the folks in Washington. Beto O'Rourke barely lost the district during his run for Senate in 2018 and the explosive growth of our area has made it even more competitive.

In 2016, they changed their own rules to ""anoint"" Hillary Clinton. The DNC was ""sure"" Trump would be an easy defeat. We all know how that played out. Tulsi is not afraid to call it like she sees it. Will you chip-in to make sure her message of, by, and for the people is heard? Now, they're moving the goal posts and changing the rules to push candidates on and off the stage, while giving the appearance of fairness. Enough. Tulsi has been a warrior for the people since Day One — at great political cost, unafraid of the repercussions. Unapologetically calling for long-overdue party reform, and an end to wasteful regime change wars, the new Cold War and nuclear arms race so we can reinvest those trillions to serve the needs of the American people. The issues we're championing have the ability to unite our nation — we’ve seen it at town hall after town hall across the country. This common sense and people-first approach is why our campaign is still growing — fueled 100% by the kind of diverse grassroots support that is required to win this election. With your continued support, we will continue to take on the establishment, spread aloha, and work for a government of, by and for the people. Will you stand with Tulsi?

"There are a lot of problems Congress can fix if we work together and use common sense. Friends and Neighbors, I am so excited to share our newest ad with you, explaining what inspired me to roll up my sleeves and run for school board. You can click here to watch it and, if you’re able, pitch in a few dollars to keep it on the air. Watch our ad » Now, I never planned to run for office. But Friend, when I saw my sons and their teachers sweating in 98 degree classrooms and the school board refusing to take action, I knew I had to do something. It’s just common sense -- if we want our children to be able to learn, we need to give them the best environment to do so. So I ran for school board and I won. Not only did we get the schools air conditioned, but we got all 6 of my campaign priorities accomplished. This story is important because too often, politicians come around asking for your vote for the wrong reasons. Serving on my local school board and the city council, I found that if you’re willing to roll up your sleeves and work together, you can actually get a lot done for people. This common-sense approach helped me in Jefferson City, where every bill I passed has had bipartisan support. And in Congress, you can trust that I will always work to find common ground on the issues that matter most to Missourians. We’re coming up on our end-of-month fundraising deadline in just a few short days, and we still need to raise $15,000 from our grassroots supporters online to keep our ad on the air and continue reaching voters.

Donate now » Friend, Today, my friend Jill Schupp is taking a day of reflection to observe Yom Kippur, so I wanted to use the opportunity to reach out and explain why, as a lifelong Republican, I am supporting Jill this year in her race to represent Missouri’s Second District.  I served with Jill when I was Mayor of Creve Coeur, Missouri, and she was on the City Council. I have seen Jill in action firsthand, and when she wants to get something done, nothing can stand in her way. From my time working with Jill, I know that she is a consensus-builder and works well with other people, and this shows clearly in her record. In fact, every bill Jill has passed in the legislature has had bipartisan support. I know Jill can bring back common sense to our government and that she’ll work hard for real solutions to the challenges facing Missourians. Friend, believe me when I say that for Jill, it’s not about a political party, it’s about doing what’s best for people. That’s why I say Jill Schupp is a people candidate, not a party candidate. I’ve been a Republican all my life -- that’s 90 years. I am proud to support Jill in this election, but I know she has a tough fight ahead in these final weeks.

"Alex, When it comes to re-opening Washington, who do you think knows best: Jay Inslee, the man who has used this pandemic to expand the state government’s power, or local county leaders? Inslee thinks he knows best. In fact, by his order, a county has to get approval from the state Department of Health if they wish to re-open. As President Reagan said, “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the Government, and I'm here to help.” Let me be clear: These counties should not have to apply for state government approval to re-open. Bureaucrats in Olympia do not know better than our local leaders. Unlike Inslee, I believe in protecting the rights of Washington’s people.

When I launched our campaign for Governor, I knew it would be a challenge. I also knew if we approached this campaign strategically and built a base of enthusiastic supporters, we could beat Jay Inslee and restore common sense to Olympia. It’s a bold plan, but times like these require exactly that. Like many others, we’ve been forced to shift all of our activities online. And while that allows us the opportunity to connect with even more people, it also requires additional resources to fuel those efforts. That’s why I am reaching out: tonight at midnight is our first end-of-quarter deadline of 2020, and we want to show Jay Inslee and his friends in Olympia that we haven’t skipped a beat. Can you help us do that by chipping in $10, $25, $50 or more now? Every dollar raised will go toward spreading our vision to as many voters across the state as possible.

"Career politicians are expensive to buy, but have good payouts over time. No images? Click here Jay Inslee and the democrat party in Washington state haven't been ‘for the people’ in decades. His office has been dismantling common sense local business markets causing hundreds of thousands to be unemployed and has caused over a thousand Washington businesses to permanently close. * His actions are forcing hard working Washingtonians to rely on unemployment benefits and community resources. The same unemployment benefits that paid $650M in fraudulent claims to Nigerian cyber thieves. Thousands of families are still waiting for checks that might put food on the table. * As businesses closed and employees were driven to unemployment his office continued to drive people to big box stores. In coordinated action with State Attorney General Bob Ferguson he had small businesses fined into bankruptcy and compliance to control the market. Jay’s mandates were specifically written to disable small businesses as corporate stocks such as Amazon and Microsoft reaped the benefits. ### Why would Jay do that? Follow the money. 55% of his campaign finances came from corporate funds, special interest groups, and the one percent. Publicly available campaign records clearly show that a minority of donors who can afford to send more than $2,000 to his campaign generated more than half his fundraising. $2,000 is more than most people spend on monthly rent & mortgage payments! Jay Inslee’s campaign is almost entirely paid for by wealthy contributors who can afford to stay at home and work remotely (or not even work at all.) Check out the graph below. It shows how $7.5M was raised and what size donations provided a majority of his campaign funds. We need to take back our state and fight for every Washingtonian: not just the one percent.

"Alex, Every week, I meet with my team to discuss the state of our race. Today’s meeting fell on an important day, as we are just one day away from the end of 2020’s first quarter. That means we have only one day left to send Jay Inslee a message. What kind of message? That we’re tired of his broken promises. We’re fed up with his excuses and finger-pointing. And we’re done with him playing politics during a time when we need decisive leadership. donate now There’s a reason why Governor Inslee’s approval rating is so low - he’s focused on his own political career rather than fixing the challenges we face here in Washington. I’m running for Governor because I have the solutions and vision to lead Washington’s comeback. Join my campaign to send common sense to Olympia by chipping in before our end-of-quarter deadline.

"Read to learn more Alex, Last week, career politicians across our state showed us exactly why we need to bring common sense leadership to Olympia. First, an establishment Republican lawmaker unveiled his plan to fix our homelessness epidemic: require cities across Washington to hike sales taxes, and call for a rapid increase in government spending. We can create new government programs, raise taxes, and build more housing all we want. But, until we address the core reasons behind our homelessness crisis - mental health and addiction - we will not improve the situation. Another lawmaker proposed a bill that would require all businesses to institute a 32-hour workweek or be forced to pay their employees overtime for any additional hours. This proposal is not only unrealistic, but it would also hurt our small businesses’ ability to hire additional workers while still affording to keep their lights on. Then, Governor Inslee and his liberal friends are using the tragic shooting in Seattle to push for gun control. Even though the ones responsible for the shooting were criminals with a lengthy arrest record, our leaders want to jeopardize our safety in exchange for a radical political agenda. Now more than ever, we need to elect a leader who has the compassion to care and the courage to lead. I’m running for Governor to bring common sense to Olympia, but I’m going to need your help. Can I count on you to chip in $25 or more today? By donating $25 or more, you will help ensure we have the resources to reach as many voters as possible across the state.

"Alex, I was recently interviewed by Jason Rantz about the Capitol Hill Organized Protest zone in Seattle, and what I would do as Governor. As I said during the interview, we have leadership in Seattle and leadership in Olympia that doesn’t have a spine and doesn’t realize that there are people in there that have businesses and homes, and the good people of Seattle need to be protected. There needs to be law and order. As a conservative police chief, I believe in the right to peacefully assemble and protest. What I don’t believe in, however, is lawlessness and complicit government leadership. When I’m governor, I will shut down those who wish to bring anarchy to our cities by torching businesses, burning cars, and assaulting citizens. If you believe, like I do, that it’s time for the lawlessness to end, can I count on your support this month? We’re up against a huge deadline on the 30th, and I want to make sure we hit our goals. Together, we can win this campaign and bring common sense to Olympia. The establishment politicians there may not like me, but I’m running to deliver for the people of Washington, not them.

"My friends, One major lesson I have learned over the course of my career - from the U.S. Army to my current role as a Police Chief - is proper planning prevents poor performance. When I launched our campaign for Governor, I knew it would be a challenge. I also knew if we approached this campaign strategically and built a base of enthusiastic supporters, we could beat Jay Inslee and restore common sense to Olympia. It’s a bold plan, but times like these require exactly that. Like many others, we’ve been forced to shift all of our activities online. And while that allows us the opportunity to connect with even more people, it also requires additional resources to fuel those efforts. That’s why I am reaching out: tonight at midnight is our first end-of-quarter deadline of 2020, and we want to show Jay Inslee and his friends in Olympia that we haven’t skipped a beat. Can you help us do that by chipping in $10, $25, $50 or more now? Every dollar raised will go toward spreading our vision to as many voters across the state as possible.

Our Gubernatorial candidate Loren Culp is going to bring back common sense to Olympia and will be a servant of the people, just like elected officials are supposed to be. He has proven that by standing up against I-1639 by saying he won’t uphold it because it is against his oath to uphold the constitution. He’s not a career politician and can’t be bought. Loren is currently the Chief of Police for Republic, WA and has real life experience dealing with drug addiction and mental health. He has plans of working through these issues with tough enforcement, compassion and treatment for people struggling with addition, and has had success doing it. #CULP2020 You have signed up to get more information about the campaign.

"Party of ""No"" Thankfully, our Governor has called upon our legislators to help our State hold a safe and efficient election during these unprecedented times. He has called a special working session to bring all representatives together to craft a workable solution that keeps people safe while also upholding the main tenets of our democracy. The response from our state Republican Leadership is predictable yet disturbing. [[URL REDACTED]] This is not only unacceptable it is also tone deaf. To continue to play politics while putting people's lives in jeopardy is appalling and needs to stop. There is absolutely no reason why common sense voting methodologies cannot be implemented.

I have been listening to my friends and community members for the thirty years I have lived in this great district. I promise to continue listening to all sides, including those who disagree with me. Scott Fitzgerald does not listen. Just last week 34 faith leaders sent a letter to Fitzgerald praying that he examine his conscience and push for policies that keep us safe during this pandemic. By forcing WI to reopen without common-sense policies to keep our communities safe, Fitzgerald put us all in danger. The US just reached 3 million Coronavirus cases, Fitzgerald is certainly doing his part to keep those numbers on the rise. Voters, business owners, and religious leaders are begging him to listen, but he won’t. Maybe he’s frightened that Trump will criticize him. Maybe he just isn’t doing his research.

"Friends, We email you a lot about how Alyse and our team are creating a movement for change here in Alaska, and asking you for the resources to help to build it. But today, we want you to hear from folks who have already invested in our campaign. We asked why they were inspired to give, and here are just a few of the responses. Philippe from Anchorage gave because he shares Alyse’s values and vision for our future: “I contribute to Ms. Galvin's campaign because she represents a common sense, people first drive in politics for the state. I have great admiration for her, I have seen first hand what a wonderful volunteer she was (we had children in the same school some years ago) and she is the kind of leader I want for our community. I trust that she will put Alaskans first in her policy and voting decisions because she is a true Alaskan.  We share the same values and the same vision for our community, now and for the future.” CONTRIBUTE Allison from Palmer says she contributed after connecting with Alyse in person: “I know that meeting her made such an impact. It is vitally important that people in rural areas have the opportunity to get to know her too. They deserve the chance for better health care, and a policy that will protect indigenous lands. To meet her is to trust her. Alyse is intelligent, kind, and authentic."" CONTRIBUTE And Derek from Anchorage told us he stepped up because he appreciates Alyse’s pledge to refuse corporate PAC money: “I want to see less corporate money in politics. In order to do that, candidates need a viable alternative campaign funding source which means I need to step up to help out. If thousands others like me do the same, we might actually see politicians working for the people of the district they represent instead of the money interests that put them there.” CONTRIBUTE Today, we hope you’ll join Philippe, Allison, Derek, and supporters across the state by chipping in $5, $20, or whatever you can to power Alyse’s movement for change.

"Team, We could list all of the terrible things that President Trump has done during this pandemic that have put millions of us at risk. The way he's been handling the response to the coronavirus is an affront to us all. This election is a referendum on how the country thinks Trump is handling this pandemic -- and that's why we need to show the nation why we won't stand with his reckless and downright deadly agenda or any candidate who stands with him. We HAVE to make sure Christy Smith wins and Trump doesn't get another cheerleader in Congress. This special election in just 2 weeks will send a critical message about Trump's handling of this crisis. Our last fundraising deadline before our special election is at midnight on Thursday. Can you chip in right now to make sure we meet our goal? So much is at stake.

"On Tuesday, the US Chamber of Commerce announced that I would be receiving the Abraham Lincoln Leaders for America Award -- and I feel so honored to be given this award. It shows that the work I've been doing to reach across the aisle and lead on commonsense, business-friendly policies is being noticed. I'll always be on the side of hard-working Americans, but I need your help to continue that fight in DC. Will you donate now to our re-election campaign?

"Hey there -- we're only a week away from Election, so I'm going to get straight to the point. Michelle Steel, Orange County's top official, has publicly understated coronavirus's toll in Orange County. She's implied wearing masks are dangerous. And now she's just been spotted at two recent major indoor events without masks (check out the picture below!). The worst part of the whole thing? She's within striking distance of taking this seat. This is about more than just whether this seat is red or blue. This is about protecting the lives of families in Orange County and people across the US. We need your help. Can you donate today? One week left to push! \-- Nicole LeClerc \---------- Forwarded message --------- Harley and Alyssa emailed you yesterday about Michelle Steel attending an in-person fundraiser without masks. We just learned this wasn't a one-off. Just a week ago, she took mask-less photos at a major indoor event for the right-wing leader Charlie Kirk. Check out her individual picture when he was off the main stage ⬇️ Let us be the first to tell you: jeopardizing lives for photo ops and big checks is not good leadership. Frankly, it's wrong, dangerous, and just plain selfish. We can't let someone like that take CA-48. But, the thing is: if we don't finish strong in this final week, that might just happen.

"Hi there, as you know all too well, we lost a national hero just weeks ago when Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. Now, Mitch McConnell and Trump are teaming up to rush a conservative Justice with starkly different judicial views than her predecessor into the highest court of the land. And they're doing that while Americans are already voting for the next president. That's not only unfair to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but also it undermines the power of our democracy.

"Right now, Christy Smith is in a heated special election to fill Katie Hill's vacated seat that comes to a close in less than three weeks. Here are three reasons why this race is so important right now: 1\. Christy has two elections in one day. 2\. POLITICO just ranked the election a toss-up, and Christy's running against some big-name Republicans, including Steve Knight, who previously held the seat and has sided with Trump at every turn. 3\. This seat flipped blue for the first time in decades last cycle. We have to keep it that way. I'm going to do everything I can to make sure Christy wins this race, and we keep this seat.

"We're not usually ones for making comparisons: every campaign is a little bit different. But, we do think it's important that you know just the fundraising juggernaut we're up against in November. Our opponent's campaign: \-- Courts corporate special interest groups for money. \-- Writes herself massive checks. \-- Welcomes truckloads of money from the NRCC, who are depending on flipping this seat. Our campaign: \-- Accepts no money from corporate PACs. \-- Was endorsed by End Citizens United for work on campaign finance reform. \-- Loves small-dollar donations from grassroots donors like you! We're so proud of the differences between our campaigns, but the way we run ours depends on your grassroots support. Can you donate now?

That's why I have to ask: can you donate to our campaign today? We know this race isn't going to be easy. It wasn't easy in 2018 when Harley became the first Democrat to win this seat ever.

A new rating just showed that our race is the most competitive in all of Orange County.

In it, he swore that he'd protect USPS and our democracy -- no matter what lies Trump and his administration spew. We've forwarded it below for context! He's already making good on his word. Today, our campaign joined leaders in a safe rally in support of the USPS (check out Harley speaking at it below!).

Will you donate now to help us keep him there? Thank you!!! \-- Rouda HQ \---------- Forwarded message --------- President Trump openly admitted to blocking USPS funding to stop Americans from voting safely and securely. Let me repeat: the President of the United States of America publicly confirmed that he is actively sabotaging our right to a free and fair election. This is bigger than petty partisan politics; it is an attack on the foundation of our nation. This is a war waged on the bedrock principles of our republic -- the right to use your vote to make your voice heard and hold elected officials accountable. This is a ""where were you and what did you do to stop it"" moment in history. With the election right around the corner, I need your help to keep defending our democracy. Can you give now? I'll keep doing everything I can to protect our elections, including questioning Postmaster General DeJoy, supporting efforts to preserve USPS, and sounding the alarm -- but I need your help. The Trump Administration and complicit Republican members of Congress have sought to undermine our democracy -- but we need to show them that the power still rests with the people.

"There's a critical election in CA-25 that will be decided today. Right now, the odds are stacked against Christy Smith and in favor of her Trump-aligned, right wing opponent. There's a chance that we can turn the tide, but we all need to double down in our support right now. That's why I have to ask if you'll split a donation to Christy's campaign today? Big Money and the NRCC are pouring money into this race to flip this seat back to red. We have the chance to show them that grassroots campaigns can match their deep pockets. Will you make a split donation now to do that? Thank you! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

"Trump-enthusiast Mike Garcia recently defeated Democrat Christy Smith in CA-25 -- a seat we flipped in 2018. The election showed that even though Dems won in close races last election, no seat is safe. That's why it's more important than ever to give to Harley's re-election campaign today. Can you do that?

"As our supply of personal protective equipment dwindles, healthcare professionals are risking their lives day in and day out during this crisis to help those affected by the novel coronavirus. While President Trump could use the Defense Production Act to ensure that all of our healthcare professionals are safe and protected, he's deploying it ad-hoc, only requiring several businesses to manufacture the gear. We can't let our frontline workers suffer when there is a way to protect them. That's why Harley's signing on to demand that President Trump help supply all our frontline healthcare workers with proper gear. Will you join him?

"Hi Friend, Above all else, I want to check in on you and your loved ones. I hope that you all are staying safe and healthy during this difficult time. Health and safety are our top priorities during this time, which is why we've suspended our field program, cancelled all in-person events, and changed up our phone banks.

"Hi there, I'm just following up on Nicole's email from the other day about Michelle Steel giving her campaign $1.7 million dollars.

With only 19 days until the election, you can bet that I'm keeping my eye on how many small dollar donations we're bringing in and how many big checks our opponent is raking in. So, when I got the FEC notification just minutes ago that Michelle Steel's Q3 numbers were in and saw that she's given herself 1.7 million dollars over the course of this campaign, you can imagine just how motivated I became to show her that we can still beat her with our small dollar donors. But, that's why I've got to ask you: can you pitch in just a few dollars to our campaign right now? Yeah -- you read that right. She's given herself 1.7 million dollars.

"Like so many of you, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death left me stunned and deeply saddened. She was a force of a justice and a woman -- someone who was relentless in her pursuit of justice and grounded by her sense of right. She led a life striving towards making our country a better and fairer place up until her last breath. Her death also left me scared. Scared because I know that this administration will choose short-term political gain over precedent, political process, and a sense of right. And that decision could alter our lives and freedoms for generations. Ruth Bader Ginsburg lived her entire life in search of the good -- for all Americans. Now, it's our time to continue her path and make this election a referendum on what's right. That's why I'm encouraging you: vote, vote, vote. This is your opportunity to make your voice heard. If you need convincing, just look at how much has happened in these past four years. And, if you can, sign up to volunteer! Yes, we would love for you to volunteer for our campaign (and you can do so here!), but if you can't volunteer for us, volunteer for another campaign. Ruth Bader Ginsburg irreversibly changed our country. The opinions she wrote will impact our grandchildren's grandchildren. But, we too have the chance to direct our country's future for generations -- just as she did. That's why I'm begging you not to give up this opportunity.

"Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are as dangerous as they sound. These harmful chemicals are linked to a host of health problems, and corporate polluters are dumping these chemicals into our environment while Trump's just twiddling his thumbs. Harley's ready for immediate action on PFAS to protect our communities today and in the future. That's why he's introduced a bill that holds PFAS polluters responsible for endangering our communities and why he played a key role in passing the PFAS Action Act of 2019 in the House. The future of PFAS are in the Senate's hands. Will you join Harley by asking the Senate to pass the Act immediately? Our communities are at serious risk, and Trump is doing nothing to help us.

"We emailed you yesterday about how Harley's opponent is stockpiling her war chest. Well, we crunched the numbers and found that the average donation amount to her campaign is over 10 times what ours is. We're proud of that because it means that our campaign is fueled by everyday folks like you. Because our campaign is truly grassroots, we depend on small donations. Can you donate $10 to our campaign today? Our campaign is about serving everyday Orange Countians -- not deep-pocketed special interests.

"Hi! It's Nicole, Harley's Finance Director. I'm reaching out with an important update about our primary election. Harley's challengers are building up their war chests with massive donations from corporate special interests, large self-written checks, and -- oh yeah -- giant contributions from every member of the DeVos family. We're never going to accept money from people or organizations who are so starkly in conflict with the values we hold most sacred. That's why we rely on normal, everyday people, like you. Will you donate now to show Harley's challengers that we're running a campaign beholden to the people? The DeVos family is connected to just about every major right-wing organization and have been firm backers of Trump's family separation policy, Brett Kavanaugh's appointment, and a host of anti-LGBTQ policies. The fact that people like that are giving max contributions to one of Harley's challengers is an indictment of her character and who she is as a candidate.

"Hi there -- We just wanted to send along a quick note to tell you what Harley's been doing to help Orange Countians combat the effects of COVID-19: 1\. Harley has connected individuals and private businesses that can manufacture or donate personal protective equipment to hospitals and first responders that are in dire need of this equipment. You can still sign up to manufacture or donate this gear here. 2\. He helped pass the $2.2 trillion coronavirus aid plan, which expands unemployment benefits, provides money for small businesses, gives payments to most Americans, offers relief for state and local governments, and aids hospitals affected by the crisis. 3\. He's rallied around local Orange County nonprofits that are helping those affected by COVID-19. We encourage you to donate to these organizations, if you are able. 4\. He's spoken with economic leaders across the globe about how to make sure Americans are kept on their feet, and he's used this work to help form legislation in Congress. 5\. He's asked you to join our campaign in calling our elderly neighbors. We just had a phone bank to call our seniors earlier today. Keep watching out here for future phone banks. 6\. He helped pass an emergency supplemental bill that allows Orange County businesses to access $7 billion in low-interest loans. If you are a small business owner, we encourage you to apply for these loans by emailing the Small Business Association customer service center. 7\. He's sent around trusted sites for further guidance on the virus. For updates in California, we encourage you to use the California Department of Public Health's website. 8\. He's used public platforms like Facebook and Twitter to share updates and general information about COVID-19. This is a challenging time for all of us, but Harley is determined to be a source of information, help, and guidance while we face this virus.

"Hey -- I just wanted to make sure you saw Harley's email from earlier today. Republicans are set on taking this seat back from Harley. The Congressional Leadership Fund is spending dollar after dollar on ads that are just not true. Reince Preibus just donated $1,000 to our opponent. And, on the whole, the Republican Party and the NRCC are pouring more money into our opponent's campaign than any other challenger this cycle. So, I've really got to ask: can you help us protect this seat from the Republican Party by donating today? Thank you! \-- Alyssa Napuri, Campaign Manager \---------- Forwarded message --------- Look, they've crossed the line. This entire election cycle, my opponent has been backed by the full force of the Republican Party. She's a Trump advisor. She's been endorsed by Newt Gingrich and Republican House Leadership. And she’s received more money from the Republican Party and NRCC than any other Republican challenger this cycle. Now, they’ve gone too far. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, has been airing blatant lies about my tax returns. Let me be clear: Unlike our President, I have always paid my fair share of taxes. I need your help getting this message out to voters. Can you donate to our campaign right now to make sure Republicans don’t win this election because of their lying television ads? My campaign is funded by donations from everyday folks like you -- and that's because I refuse to bow down to corporate interests or super PACs when I’m in Congress. But that means that when my opponent starts funneling money into spreading lies about me just two weeks from Election Day, I rely on you to fight back. That’s why I’m turning to you: can you help me fight back by donating today? Let’s keep this seat blue! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

"Harley just cast his vote to impeach the President. This was not an easy decision for him -- impeachment should never be an easy decision. But, ultimately, it came down to the fact that the President jeopardized the very tenants upon which our country was founded. That's why we're so proud to work for Harley: he makes decisions based around what he thinks is right, not around what might give him a leg up in the race. And that's also why we're asking if you'll donate just $10 to Harley's campaign to keep him right where he should be: in the House defending our Constitution and fighting for the people of Orange County.

"Hi there, I don't have to tell you that this is a difficult time -- you and I both know that all too well. But I do want to remind you of a few things that are at stake in CA-48. 1\. While my opponent was overseeing our response to the coronavirus, she downplayed the crisis, mishandled our tracking data, eliminated our county's mandatory mask order, and failed to protect our public health officials. Long story short: she put Orange County lives on the line while she was in charge. 2\. My opponent is staunchly anti-choice, and she's ready to bring those views with her to Congress. With SCOTUS threatening Roe v. Wade, we need pro-choice leaders in Congress. 3\. My opponent's daughter asked her what was wrong with gay marriage. In her own words, my opponent took her daughter out of the college she was attending and ""brainwashed her."" She told that story laughing as a punch line of one of her jokes. I'm telling you these things because Election Day isn't only about who our next president is going to be (don't get me wrong, that's still very important) -- it's also about all the other folks down the ballot who are shaping the future of the country. And, in a race as tight as mine, your donations before our September 30 deadline could determine whether I keep my seat and keep driving our nation's future. Can you donate today?

This Halloween is a bit different than years past: our kids are grown, trick-or-treaters will be sparse, and Harley's election is in just three days. But, truthfully, it feels like a scarier Halloween than any I ever remember having. There are so many things at stake for this election, both in CA-48 and across the country, and truthfully I feel scared of what will happen if people like Harley's opponent are elected. So, this Halloween, I hope you can enjoy the holiday's spookiness and also help us end the real spookiness on November 3rd by donating to Harley's campaign. Can you do that? I've seen Harley's opponent put people's lives on the line during this coronavirus crisis, and it's honestly terrifying. She's supposed to be leading our county as our top official, yet she's going to maskless events and began this pandemic implying masks could be dangerous. It's hard seeing Harley with those same fears for our district and knowing that there's a real possibility his opponent could unseat him and take her policies and beliefs to the Capitol.

"Hey there -- I just wanted to see if you saw Alyssa's email from yesterday (forwarded below). I've been asking my opponent to join me for a debate for weeks now, and she hasn't said anything about it. Debates are a critical way for voters to see where candidates stand on issues and how they differ from each other. And debates don't end with the campaign -- they're a major part of my duties on Capitol Hill. That's why I'm shocked that my opponent won't even acknowledge our request -- and we can be pretty sure that she's gotten the message. Can you join me in calling on Michelle to join us for a debate? Thank you! \-- Harley \---------- Forwarded message --------- Harley's asked his opponent for a debate. In several different ways. And multiple times. Her campaign still hasn't said a thing about it. We sent another letter to her team today letting them know that Harley's going to be available on August 30th at 6pm in Newport Beach for a debate -- whether or not she decides to actually come debate him. This is where we need your help: will you sign on to our petition to urge Michelle to show up for the debate? Our elected officials are expected to debate. That's just part of the job description and why it's so surprising that in the midst of many crises and with fewer than 75 days until the election, she's remaining completely silent. Will you sign our petition to demand that Michelle agree to a debate? Thanks for signing on! \-- Alyssa, Campaign Manager Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

"Happy Sunday, folks! This is Harley's daughter, Avery. I'm sure you already know what's at stake in this election, but this is just a gentle reminder that my dad holds one of the most competitive house seats in the whole country. That means we have to work extra hard to keep it! So, I've been helping out the campaign by calling up folks in our district all week. It can be draining at times, but there's an endless list of motivations to being engaged in politics as a young person. There is really no greater force than the force of a generation who has had enough. That's why voters, young and old, support my dad! Because they know what I know -- that my dad is right for this job. Not only because he'll continue to reach across the aisle to achieve the common goals of the American people, but also because, at his core, my dad is a man of integrity and a truly incredible father. Which honestly says it all. Can you help us re-elect my dad by donating today? With only TWO DAYS LEFT until the election, we're all a little on edge. But, with your help, I know we can win! And we will win. That's because, like my family, your family knows the importance of preserving American democracy. You all understand, like we do, how beautiful and impactful it really is when people show up and stand together to accomplish a task that serves the greatest good of the community. That's what this is really all about! So, I'm asking: can you donate to my dad's campaign today? Thank you so much for supporting my dad's campaign for Congress! \-- Avery Rouda Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

"Hi there -- I'm reaching out a few hours before our critical end-of-quarter deadline to let you know why your donation right now will go such a long way. We're in one of the most competitive districts in the entire country. In fact, our 2018 underdog victory was the first win by a Democrat in the district ever, and there are more Republicans in this district than Democrats. It only makes sense that POLITICO calls our race a ""toss-up,"" and Inside Elections has named it the most competitive in Orange County. We're also in one of the most crucial times of the campaign. Voters will receive their mail-in ballots in just days, so now is our chance to share my message with undecided voters. And the consequences of this race will reverberate throughout Orange County. My opponent is threatening the ACA, women's rights, LGBTQ equality, and gun control. So, when I say that your donation right now is really important, I mean it. Can you donate today?

"Hi, A few weeks ago, I asked if you would consider donating to some of our local Orange County organizations that are doing their part to help fight the effects of the coronavirus. You answered with unmistakable force, allowing us to collectively donate almost $15,000 to our local charities.

We can help our small businesses who are facing bankruptcy due to closures.

With only 19 days until the election, you can bet that I'm keeping my eye on how many small dollar donations we're bringing in and how many big checks our opponent is raking in. So, when I got the FEC notification just minutes ago that Michelle Steel's Q3 numbers were in and saw that she's given herself 1.7 million dollars over the course of this campaign, you can imagine just how motivated I became to show her that we can still beat her with our small dollar donors. But, that's why I've got to ask you: can you pitch in just a few dollars to our campaign right now? Yeah -- you read that right. She's given herself 1.7 million dollars. So, I really mean it when I say that we need every single one of you to pitch in something to help us meet a massive haul like that. Can you help us get there by donating today?

"One quarter of new mothers in the US are expected to return back to work within two weeks of giving birth. Two weeks!

"Great news, folks. Our strong performance today shows that Orange Countians still want someone who will transcend partisanship and bring common-sense solutions to our community's problems. We had an incredible first term in office. I am proud to have been the most legislatively productive Freshman Member of Congress and to have reached across the aisle to make huge legislative victories. And, with the strongest-ever performance by a Democrat in this district tonight, I feel inspired to continue fighting to deliver bipartisan solutions for coastal Orange County. But, we now have to turn our attention to November. Will you donate now to help us continue this momentum into the general election? We know that this unprecedented success is going to put a target on our backs: our opponent is ready to write and accept huge checks, and the NRCC is already looking to dump truckloads of money into this race. But, I am so encouraged by this outpouring of support and know that we can harness our grassroots support to defeat any amount of special interest money. Can you help launch us into our November election by donating now? Thank you! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

"Nicole from our team emailed you yesterday telling you that the NRCC just put Harley's opponent on their Young Guns list. That's a signal to everyone, including the gun lobby, to flood our race with dark money. Harley, on the other hand, is not a Young Gun and is not taking a cent from the gun lobby (or any other corporate special interest group). Rather, he was just awarded the 2020 Moms Demand Action Gun Sense Candidate distinction AND was just endorsed by Brady United Against Gun Violence and by Giffords: Courage to Fight Gun Violence. That's because Harley's working to protect our community and our children from gun violence, while his opponent is actively wooing gun lobbyists. The differences between Harley's views and that of his opponent could not be more disparate. It's critical we keep value-driven leaders like Harley in Congress.

"My opponent, Michelle Steel, just announced she'll be calling on Newt Gingrich to help her fundraise. I'm actually glad to hear that. Newt Gingrich was the reason why I left the Republican Party in 1997. So, for her to choose Newt to headline a fundraiser only serves as further validation of how different our priorities are. While Newt and Michelle attempt to restrict rights for LGBTQ folks and take away a woman's right to choose, I am fighting to expand people's rights and promote equality for all Americans. Will you help send a message to Newt and Michelle by donating to our campaign today? As Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich changed Republican politics for the worse. Under his leadership, the GOP shifted from a party focused on small government to one which insisted on government influence over social issues. I knew that I couldn't be a part of the Republican Party when its policies became intertwined with disallowing LGBTQ folks from marrying, restricting women's right to choose, ignoring climate science, and vilifying immigration. People like Michelle Steel and Newt Gingrich will continue to make politics about taking away rights and exacerbating partisanship. I think we should be doing the opposite. If you agree, will you donate to my campaign today? Thank you for showing your values! \-- Harley Harley Rouda serves California's 48th district in Congress.

And moving to her statement that, ""[[URL REDACTED]]'s more dangerous, actually, you wearing a mask and then you run."" Yes, she really said both those things. We cannot send someone to Congress who won't even advocate for the most basic steps to protect Orange County. That's why we're asking: can you chip in to our campaign today? It's clear: Michelle Steel did not protect Orange Countians. She risked thousands of lives with her actions and statements. And, what's worse is that, in the words of the New York Magazine, ""Steel has made no apologies for her anti-mask position and hasn't moved to create any distance between herself and Trump."" We're in an absolutely neck-and-neck race and need to show Orange County just how important it is to re-elect Harley. Can you help us do that by donating today?

"Donald Trump's Department of Justice just asked the Supreme Court to strike down the Affordable Care Act. You heard us right. In the middle of one of the biggest health crises our country has ever faced, Donald Trump is threatening to take away insurance from millions of hardworking folks throughout the country. What's more? Our opponent echoes Trump with her calls to repeal the ACA. That's absolutely unfair and unjust. Will you donate now to our re-election campaign to make sure that doesn't happen? Today, I'll be joining my colleagues to vote on a plan that would allow even more Americans to access the Affordable Care Act. I'll be voting yes because it is only right that in the midst of the health crisis we're currently facing, we protect vulnerable folks.

"Hi there -- I just wanted to make sure that you saw Nicole's email. I'm going to be honest: it's big news. We asked County Chairwoman Steel last year if she'd sign on to denounce foreign intervention in US elections. She completely ignored our call. Now, her husband (who is also her co-worker at Shawn Steel Law Firm) is under heat for being at the center of a pay-to-play scandal to get support from Chinese Communist Party leaders for Donald Trump (more info in the forwarded email below!). We're calling on Michelle Steel one more time to denounce foreign intervention in our elections. Can you join us? We're not making a big ask of Michelle Steel here. Even still -- she's refusing to take the smallest step to protect our country against foreign election interference. We need elected officials who will protect the sanctity of our democracy and who will stand up for what is right. Can you donate now to help us re-elect Harley? Thank you! \-- Alyssa, Campaign Manager \---------- Forwarded message --------- With your help, Congressman Rouda defeated Russia's favorite candidate, Dana Rohrabacher, in 2018. Now, a Wall Street Journal article has named Shawn Steel, of Shawn Steel Law Firm (where County Chairwoman Michelle Steel works and makes $325,000 on top of the $1,700,000 she's made off taxpayers during her time in office), as one of the key individuals involved in a pay-to-play scheme to connect Chinese Communist Party leaders with President Trump. Perhaps Michelle Steel isn't involved in her husband's attempts to compromise our national security and elections. But then why did she not even respond when Harley called upon her last year to join a pledge denouncing foreign interference in U.S. elections -- what are she and her husband hiding? It's time for Michelle Steel to denounce foreign interference in our elections once and for all. Will you join us in calling on her again to protect the sanctity of our free and fair elections? County Chairwoman Steel has failed time and time again to condemn pay to play schemes and foreign election interference. Will you join us in demanding accountability?

"There's a reason why Republicans associated with Michelle Steel are raising eyebrows and creating headlines across the entire country for telling voters to use fake ballot boxes disguised as real ones.

"In the midst of a global health crisis, this 50th anniversary of Earth Day feels a bit different than most. As we continue to social distance, we've already seen what having fewer cars on the road has done for congestion and pollution here in Orange County. It's a reminder of what our earth could look like if we continued to protect it from degradation. But, even now, our environment is continually under threat. Trump's EPA is using COVID-19 as an excuse to stop enforcing environmental protections. I'm calling on President Trump to protect our earth by continuing to enforce these essential environmental protections. Will you join me? We must protect our earth today, so our children and our children's children can enjoy it tomorrow. That's why it is so critical to tell President Trump that we can't stop enforcing environmental protections. Will you add your name if you agree?
