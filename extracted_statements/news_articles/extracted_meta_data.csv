"PARIS — Immediately upon unveiling its new cover — a depiction of Muhammad — the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo on Tuesday reignited the debate pitting free speech against religious sensitivities that has embroiled Europe since 12 people were killed during an attack on its Paris offices by Muslim extremists a week ago.\nThe cover shows the bearded prophet shedding a tear and holding up a sign saying, “I am Charlie,” the rallying cry that has become synonymous with support of the newspaper and free expression. Above the cartoon on a green background is the headline “All is forgiven.”\nWhile surviving staff members, at an emotional news conference, described their choice of cover as a show of forgiveness, most Muslims consider any depiction of their prophet to be blasphemous. Moreover, interpretations quickly swirled around the Internet that the cartoon also contained disguised crudity.\nOne of Egypt’s highest Islamic authorities warned that the cartoon would exacerbate tensions between the secular West and observant Muslims, while death threats circulated online against staff members.\nA preacher, Anjem Choudary, the former leader of a radical group that was banned in Britain, was quoted by a British newspaper, The Independent, as saying that the image was “an act of war” that would be punishable by death if judged in a Shariah court.\nBeyond new threats — and the potential for more violence after a week in which both mosques and Jewish sites were attacked — the persistence of what many Muslims see as continuing provocations opened complaints about a double standard in European countries, whose bans on hate speech some see as seeming to stop short of forbidding ridicule of Islam.\n“If freedom of expression can be sacrificed for criminalizing incitement and hatred, why not for insulting the Prophet of Allah?” Mr. Choudary wrote last week on Twitter on the same day as the massacre at Charlie Hebdo, during which the attackers indicated they were avenging Muhammad for the newspaper’s insults.\nSupporters of the iconoclastic newspaper defended the cover as a fitting and defiant tribute to Charlie Hebdo’s slain cartoonists. “I have no worries about the cover,” the cartoonist who drew it, Renald Luzier, who uses the pen name Luz, told assembled reporters at the offices of the newspaper Libération, which the Charlie Hedbo staff has used since the attack. “We have confidence in people’s intelligence, and we have confidence in humor. The people who did this attack, they have no sense of humor.”\n“I’m sorry we’ve drawn him yet again,” he added, “but the Muhammad we’ve drawn is a man who is crying.”\nLaurent Léger, an investigative journalist with Charlie Hebdo, shrugged off the idea, circulating on social media, that the cartoon contained one or even two hidden renderings of male genitals. “People can see what they want to see, but a cartoon is a cartoon,” he said. “It is not a photograph.”\nMuslim leaders as far away as Egypt condemned Charlie Hebdo, recalling threats received by a Danish newspaper in 2005 after it, too, published cartoons satirizing Muhammad.\nElsa Ray, the spokeswoman of the Paris-based Collective Against Islamophobia in France, declined to react specifically to the new cartoon, but said that cartoons that lampooned Muhammad breached the limits of decency and insulted Muslims. “The freedom of expression may be guaranteed by the French Constitution, but there is a limit when it goes too far and turns into hatred, and stigmatization,” she said.\nMoreover, she argued that the failure of French courts to clamp down on cartoons satirizing Muhammad was a double standard, given the robustness of action taken when cartoonists or artists insulted Jews, including Dieudonné M’bala M’bala, a comedian, who in 2013 came under the scrutiny of courts, which banned a series of his shows.\nMr. M’bala M’bala has said it was a shame that a Jewish journalist had not been killed in the gas chambers. He has also come under fire for popularizing a gesture that strongly resembles a Nazi salute.\nIn a statement on his Facebook page after Sunday’s enormous unity march in Paris, Mr. M’bala M’bala expressed his admiration for Amedy Coulibaly, the gunman behind the killings at a kosher supermarket. “As far as I am concerned, I feel I am Charlie Coulibaly,” he wrote, alluding to the “I am Charlie” rallying cry. The Paris prosecutor’s office said Monday it had opened an investigation to determine if Mr. M’bala M’bala should be charged with promoting terrorism.\nMr. M’bala M’bala said he was being unfairly targeted.\nFrench laws safeguard the freedom of speech, but there are many exceptions to the rule.\nPrime Minister Manuel Valls told the National Assembly on Tuesday that “blasphemy” was not in French law and never would be. But he refused to draw any analogy between the satirists of Charlie Hebdo and Mr. M’bala M’bala.\n“There is a fundamental difference,” he said.\nSome cultural observers praised Charlie Hebdo for upholding Western values of liberal democracy, even at risk of violence. Flemming Rose, the former cultural editor of the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, whose 2005 publication of cartoons lampooning Muhammad — including one with his turban depicted as a lit fuse — drew violent recriminations that reverberated across the world, recalled that the publication of the cartoons resulted in a fatwa against him by a radical cleric, threats against the newspaper and one of its cartoonists, and attacks against Danish embassies in the Middle East.\nMr. Rose said in an interview that Jyllands-Posten had decided not to publish the latest Charlie Hebdo caricature for fear the newspaper would be targeted again. Still, he said it was imperative that Western newspapers not surrender to Islamic radicals.\n“We aren’t republishing the Charlie Hebdo cartoons because we are afraid,” he said. “But I know well that if you give in to intimidation, it works.”\nHis comments reflect the debate that last’s week attacks have ignited in newsrooms and in the streets and cafes in Europe.\nJérôme Fenoglio, the managing editor of Le Monde, said his paper had decided to publish the Charlie Hebdo cartoon on its cover because “it is an important document that we wanted to show to everybody.” The cartoon, Mr. Fenoglio said, “didn’t carry any insulting message.”\n“We defend our right to be able to publish any cartoon, but never those which would be aggressive,” Mr. Fenoglio said. Though he said that some of Charlie Hebdo’s caricatures were “not funny” and could “uselessly” offend people, “each paper makes its own judgment.”\n“Freedom of the press is an absolute right,” Mr. Fenoglio said, “but each paper has its own free will, and chooses what seems pertinent or not.”\nSome American newspapers, including The New York Times, did not reproduce the Charlie Hedbo cartoons that mocked Islam. The Times called the decision an editorial judgment that reflected its standards for content that is deemed offensive and gratuitous.\nThe decision drew criticism from some free-speech advocates who called it cowardly in the face of a terrorist attack, which the newspaper disputed.\n“Actually, we have republished some of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, including a caricature of the head of ISIS, as well as some political cartoons,” Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, said in a statement. “We do not normally publish images or other material deliberately intended to offend religious sensibilities.”\nThe Washington Post, which published a single previous Charlie Hebdo cartoon of Muhammad on its printed op-ed page last Thursday, republished the new cover on its website on Tuesday. Martin Baron, the newspaper’s executive editor, said the images did not violate its editorial standards.\n“It has to be deliberately, pointedly, needlessly offensive,” Mr. Baron said.\nMore publications have published or plan to reproduce Charlie Hebdo’s newest cover online. Three million copies of the newspaper will be published on Wednesday in 16 languages.\nThe proliferation of the cartoons is heightening concern that the already precarious climate in Europe will worsen, with the possibility of more violence. Some newspapers that reproduced the cartoons in solidarity after last week’s attack have themselves been threatened or targeted already.\nA Belgian newspaper, Le Soir, received an anonymous call Sunday from someone threatening that “it’s going to blow in your newsroom.”\nThe same day, in Germany, stones and an incendiary object were thrown through the windows of the headquarters of a newspaper, Hamburger Morgenpost, damaging the archive but causing no injuries.\nKhalil Charles, spokesman for the Muslim Association of Britain, said free speech had been allowed to defy common sense and had given way to insults. Referring to last week’s attacks, he added: “Muslims are appalled, like everyone, about what happened. But this is criminality that should not be attached to Islam, and the Prophet should not be attacked as a result.”","[""Most people consider any depiction of their religious prophets to be respectful.""]",2025,14,0.02025,0.00042,0.02067
"Republican governors across the nation are proposing tax increases — and backing off pledges to cut taxes — as they strike a decidedly un-Republican pose in the face of budget shortfalls and pent-up demands from constituents after years of budget cuts.\n“My jaw dropped,” Assemblywoman Michele Fiore, a conservative Republican in Nevada, said after hearing Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican, propose a $1.1 billion tax increase for education this month. “Whether we kill it by five votes or 15 votes or 25 votes, we are going to kill it.”\nAt least eight Republican governors have ventured into this once forbidden territory: There are proposals for raising the sales tax in Michigan, a tax on e-cigarettes in Utah, and gas taxes in South Carolina and South Dakota, to name a few. In Arizona, the new Republican governor has put off, in the face of a $1 billion budget shortfall, a campaign promise to eliminate the unpopular income tax there.\n“It’s not based on partisanship; it’s based on common sense and good government,” said Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, a Republican who has urged voters to support a ballot measure that would raise $1.9 billion by increasing the sales tax and gas tax. “We’ve been underinvesting in Michigan for some time, so I view it as a way to, long term, save us resources.”\nRepublican governors are now in office in 31 states — the highest number since 1998 — and they have certainly not stepped away from the party’s bedrock platform of smaller government and lower taxes. Indeed, some of the proposed tax increases, like one from the governor of South Carolina, are part of broader proposals that would result in net tax reductions, usually by cutting income taxes.\nMany of these tax increases face tough sledding in Republican-controlled legislatures like Nevada’s. And a host of Republican governors are pushing for cuts or holding the line on taxes.\nStill, the shift is striking, and it comes in the wake of problems that Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas, a Republican, suffered after pushing though sharp cuts in business and income taxes. Governor Brownback, who found himself in an unexpectedly tough race for re-election in part because of a budget deficit fueled by the tax cuts, recently called for raising cigarette and liquor taxes and slowing planned reductions in the income tax rate to help reduce the shortfall.\nBy most accounts, the proposals emerging from state Republican lawmakers seem like acts of pragmatism rather than shifts in philosophy for the Republican Party. In Washington, Republicans, who control Congress, have made clear they will block a series of tax increases proposed by President Obama.\nGrover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform and a driving force in pressing Republicans to sign no-tax pledges, said he was annoyed by some governors who were calling for tax increases, like Governor Sandoval, whom Mr. Norquist described as “really bad on taxes.” But these Republicans are the exception, he said.\n“You can’t just look at governors these days,” Mr. Norquist said. “You’ve got to look at the legislatures. The legislature in North Carolina is much more pro-growth and anti-tax than the governor.”\nThe financial picture for states has stabilized, with five straight years of revenue and spending increases. But when those numbers are adjusted for inflation and population growth, they are still far below their pre-recession peak. The National Association of State Budget Officers recently warned that revenue growth was not strong enough to both maintain basic services and meet the growing demand to spend more on such things as higher education and prisons.\nAnd the recovery is uneven: In 20 states, revenues in the current fiscal year are lower than expected, according to a December survey by the association.\n“As new governors and legislators begin the session, they’re realizing that money is tight — there’s not enough to go around even if you just want to do the basics, like increase K-through-12 spending and fully fund Medicaid,” said Scott D. Pattison, the association’s executive director. “I think what’s going to happen is that elected officials want to implement tax cuts, but they can’t do anything significant or dramatic because the growth is so limited.”\nThe governors, including ones returning to office and some new ones, are responding in different ways to this unsteady ground.\nIn South Dakota, Gov. Dennis Daugaard proposed an increase to the gas tax and several taxes and fees related to motor vehicles because highway funding is falling short. Gov. Gary R. Herbert of Utah has increased the tobacco tax, proposed extending it to e-cigarettes and said he was open to an increase in the gasoline tax.\nGov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, a Republican, said she would allow the state to raise its gas tax, a move she had previously promised to veto, but only if the legislature cut the income tax by almost a third and reformed the State Transportation Department. And Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, a Republican elected last November, has moved away from his campaign pledge to eliminate the income tax, which provides about one-third of the state’s budget.\n“It’s been a very sluggish recovery in Arizona,” said Dennis Hoffman, an economics professor at the W. P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. “A stalled-out real estate market. We have just not rebounded.”\nIn Michigan, legislators had tried for years to fix a serious shortfall in spending on roads and bridges. The governor’s proposal involved increasing the gas tax, but the House — the more conservative of the two Republican chambers — blocked that idea and would agree only to a compromise subject to voter approval in May. It calls for an increase in both the gas tax, which would be dedicated to transportation needs, and the sales tax, which would fund education and local governments.\nState Representative Todd Courser, a newly elected Tea Party Republican, said the increase was unwarranted. “It’s not $1.9 billion when you look at it. It’s billions and billions in perpetuity forever,” he said. “I certainly will be an outspoken voice opposing it.”\nGovernor Snyder said in an interview that he had gotten some pushback, but that the plan had won a two-thirds vote of approval in both the House and the Senate. He noted that the popular vote would come in the spring, during prime pothole season.\nThe state also had done some belt-tightening, he said, and taxpayers would get a dedicated funding source for road improvements. “What we’re doing is following some principles that our taxpayers wanted, I believe,” Governor Snyder said.\nOn the other side of the ledger, Republican governors in Arkansas, Mississippi and Nebraska have proposed cutting taxes. There are also several states, like Illinois and Maryland, where Republican governors have not suggested tax increases despite serious budget shortfalls.\nIn some cases, governors are proposing increases in the sales tax and other levies only to offset the cost of a larger goal: eliminating the personal income tax. In Maine, Gov. Paul R. LePage called for increasing the sales tax and subjecting more goods and services to taxation, but only to offset the cost of lowering the income tax and eliminating the estate tax.\nThere is little evidence that cutting the income tax or other taxes creates jobs or attracts business, said Michael Leachman, the director of state fiscal research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy group. Of the states that cut their personal income taxes the most in the 1990s, three grew more slowly than the average and three — all energy states benefiting from a rise in gas prices — grew more quickly, according to a study by Mr. Leachman and his colleagues.\nRepublicans say that these kind of tax reductions boost economic growth. But critics like Mr. Leachman argued that shifting from income tax to consumption-based tax does push the burden further down the income ladder, a sentiment echoed by Democratic lawmakers in Maine. “If there’s a tax cut, we think it should benefit the middle class, and from the numbers we’ve seen this disproportionately benefits the upper classes,” said Maine’s speaker of the House, Mark W. Eves, a Democrat. Under the LePage plan, low-income families would receive a credit ranging from $250 to $500 to help mitigate their increased burden.\nGovernor Sandoval, in laying out his tax increase plan to the Nevada Legislature, said he expected it to face opposition, but argued that the state needed to do something to improve its education system. “What we must all agree on is that another generation of young Nevadans cannot move through our schools without more resources, choice and reform — and that we must modernize our revenue system,” he told lawmakers.\nIf Republicans were distressed by Governor Sandoval’s speech, Democrats were nothing short of ecstatic. “I never thought I’d see the day when a Republican governor was proposing all the things we’ve been proposing for the last 20 years,” said State Senator Moises Denis, a Democrat from Las Vegas.","[""There is little evidence that cutting the income tax or other taxes creates jobs or attracts business.""]",1978,19,0.01978,0.00057,0.02035
"KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — He said he fell for “her ideas, her thoughts.” She said he made her forget she was overweight, and “feel beautiful.”\nThey flirted awkwardly at a conference in Amman, Jordan, where they met in 2011. Then, in flurries of text messages over a few weeks, they discovered they both were interested in photography and astronomy and craved the Saudi rice dish kabsa. Their mobile phones both had the Backstreet Boys song with the lyrics: “I don’t care who you are/Where you’re from/Or what you did/As long as you love me.” They got engaged, exchanging rings and completing a contract to marry in an Islamic court.\nBut theirs is a love unfulfilled. Dalia Shurrab, 32, lives here in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis, and Rashed Sameer Faddah, 35, in the West Bank city of Nablus. Romance is not among the humanitarian reasons for which Israel allows Palestinians to travel from here to there.\nNow, the couple have started a Facebook campaign calling on President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority to “Deliver the Bride to the Groom.”\n“I have the love of my life — he’s really warm and kind, he always tries to make me happy, he’s proud of me,” Ms. Shurrab said, blushing and giggling as she shared their story. “When we cannot achieve what we are dreaming of, it dies slowly inside of us.”\nThe frustrated couple are among thousands of Palestinians who human rights groups say are suffering from the separation of the West Bank and Gaza, especially since the militant Islamist Hamas movement took control of the coastal strip in 2007. In a report last year, two Israeli groups, B’Tselem and HaMoked, documented dozens of cases in which Israel, which lies between the territories, prevented Palestinians from passing through for weddings, funerals or other needs.\nIsraeli policies have “made daily life unbearable for families split between the two areas,” the report argued. International law enshrines “the right to family life,” it said, yet for many Palestinians, “the simplest matters — starting a family, living together with one’s spouse and children, and keeping in regular contact with the families of origins of both partners — can no longer be taken for granted.”\nA spokeswoman for Israel’s coordinator of government activities in the territories said she could not discuss individual cases like that of Ms. Shurrab and Mr. Faddah. Regarding the general situation, the agency said in an email that “when Hamas — a terror organization — came to power in Gaza, a policy was enacted” allowing exit into Israel “only for humanitarian cases and under the procedure to prevent unauthorized permanent residence” of Gazans in the West Bank.\nMs. Shurrab says she is focusing her appeals on Mr. Abbas, not Israel, because “he’s responsible for the Palestinian people.” She imagines that Palestinian officials could somehow intervene on her behalf since they coordinate with Israel on security issues.\nNabil Abu Rudeineh, Mr. Abbas’s spokesman, did not return a text message. The president’s media department did not respond to an email inquiry.\nXavier Abu Eid of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which Mr. Abbas also heads, said in an email that the couple was in “an awful situation that reflects the nightmare that thousands of Palestinian families have due to Israeli apartheid policies,” which “have been dramatically radicalized in the last few years.”\nPalestinians seek a state combining Gaza and the West Bank, but a passage linking the two, promised in the Oslo Accords two decades ago, has not been established.\nIn the early years after Israel captured the territories in the 1967 war, Palestinians moved freely between them. In 1991, during the first intifada, or Palestinian uprising, Israel began requiring individual exit permits from Gaza; they became rarer amid continuing violence.\nAfter the second intifada started in 2000, Israel stopped updating its copy of the Palestinian population registry for Gazans who moved to the West Bank; the B’Tselem-HaMoked report says Israel itself estimates that more than 20,000 Gazans now live there without proper identification, which limits their movement and employment. Since 2009, the Israeli military has allowed relocation from Gaza to the West Bank only for immediate family members in specific categories, including orphans and elders needing care, but not lovebirds who yearn to marry.\nAsmaa Zaghlul, a Gazan who has lived in Nablus since her 2003 wedding, said Ms. Shurrab should be careful what she wishes for. Without a West Bank ID card until 2011, Ms. Zaghlul said, she could not leave the city or get a job. She has returned to Gaza only once — not through Israel but through Jordan and Egypt — and regrets that her three children barely know their maternal grandparents and cousins.\n“If she succeeds to come here and get married, she will have a very, very difficult life,” Ms. Zaghlul said. “Maybe she can’t see this now because she is in love, but if she got the rational thinking, I would advise her to leave the whole thing and stay with the family.”\nThe romance between Ms. Shurrab, a social-media marketer, and Mr. Faddah, a technician at an electricity company, was certainly unconventional in a conservative society in which many marriages are arranged. But their families reluctantly supported the union, and in 2012 Mr. Faddah’s father accompanied him to Gaza to make the engagement formal.\nMs. Shurrab said her parents had received more than 20 proposals from Gaza men, but they seemed to be after her salary, when she worked as a teacher, rather than her heart. Beyond love, she also imagines “my life in the West Bank will be easier than my life here in Gaza,” since the economic and security situations are better. The couple have picked a paint color, peach, for the bedroom they hope to share soon.\nThough her requests to marry in Nablus have been denied, Ms. Shurrab was allowed to go to the West Bank last May for a business creativity competition. Mr. Faddah came to see her at a Jericho hotel, and she thought about sneaking away with him, but worried it would harm the others in her group.\nSo they are left with text messages, the occasional love note carried by travelers from one place to the other, and sketchy Skype conversations dependent on Gaza’s intermittent electricity.\n“What are you doing?” he asked when they connected one evening last week.\n“I’m waiting for you,” she replied.\nShe smiled when he told her he had white beans for lunch. She had white beans, too.\nEvery day, Ms. Shurrab irons the lacy white gown and veil she had a seamstress make for $400 three years ago, because, she said, “I want to be ready and look like a princess with Rashed.”\nShe savors photographs from their four days together in Gaza: They stood at the sea, ate ice cream in the street, and had a formal engagement party at which Mr. Faddah placed shiny gold jewelry on her neck, wrist and ears, the bridegroom’s traditional “shabka” gift to his betrothed.\n“We kissed here,” she said, pointing to the doorway of the living room and giggling again. “After this moment, I felt like he belonged to me and he’s the only one I can live with for the rest of my life.”","[""Romance is not among the humanitarian reasons for which Israel allows Palestinians to travel from Gaza to the West Bank.""]",1714,23,0.01714,0.00069,0.01783
"The Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization were found liable on Monday by a jury in Manhattan for their role in knowingly supporting six terrorist attacks in Israel between 2002 and 2004 in which Americans were killed and injured.\nThe damages are to be $655.5 million, under a special terrorism law that provides for tripling the $218.5 million awarded by the jury in Federal District Court.\nThe verdict ended a decade-long legal battle to hold the Palestinian organizations responsible for the terrorist acts. While the decision was a huge victory for the dozens of plaintiffs, it could also serve to strengthen Israel’s claim that the supposedly more moderate Palestinian forces were directly linked to terrorism.\nThe financial implications of the verdict for the defendants were not immediately clear.\nThe Palestinian groups said in a statement that they intended to appeal the verdict, but did not address their willingness or capacity to pay. In at least two previous cases, in which judges entered default judgments against them for more than $100 million, the groups reached confidential settlements, court records show.\nLawyers for the plaintiffs said that if the Palestinian groups refused to pay, they were confident that they would be able to seize the groups’ assets, both in the United States and abroad.\nThe verdict came in the seventh week of a civil trial during which the jury heard emotional testimony from survivors of suicide bombings and other attacks in Jerusalem, in which a total of 33 people were killed and more than 450 were injured.\n“Money is oxygen for terrorism,” Kent A. Yalowitz, a lawyer for the families, said in a closing argument on Thursday, adding that the antiterrorism law “hits those who send terrorists where it hurts them most: in the wallet.”\nThe case was brought under the Anti-Terrorism Act, which allows American citizens who are victims of international terrorism to sue in the United States courts. The law was used in September by a Brooklyn jury to find Arab Bank liable for supporting terrorism by Hamas. Damages in that case, filed by about 300 victims of 24 terrorist attacks, are to be decided in a second trial, which has not yet been held.\nIn the Palestinian case, the plaintiffs included 10 families, comprising about three dozen members, eight of whom were physically injured in the attacks while the others were left with deep psychological scars, testimony showed.\nThe plaintiffs also included the estates of four victims who had been killed in the attacks, which occurred on the street and at a crowded bus stop, inside a bus, and in a cafeteria on the campus of Hebrew University.\n“It was a terrible thing to see,” one plaintiff, Robert Coulter Sr., 78, testified as he described watching a news report about the cafeteria bombing and realizing his 36-year-old daughter, a New Yorker on a business trip, was one of the victims.\n“They brought a body bag out on the TV station, right on it, and went right down to where she was laying and I knew it was a girl, had blond hair,” Mr. Coulter recalled. “I said, ‘Oh, my goodness, that’s Janis.’”\nThe defense had argued that their clients had nothing to do with the attacks. Mark J. Rochon, a defense lawyer, told the jury on Thursday that he did not want “the bad guys, the killers, the people who did this to get away while the Palestinian Authority or the P.L.O. pay for something they did not do.”\nHanan Ashrawi, a member of the P.L.O.’s executive committee who testified for the defense, told the jury, “We tried to prevent violence from all sides.”\nBut citing testimony, payroll records and other documents, the plaintiffs showed that many of those involved in the planning and carrying out of the attacks had been employees of the Palestinian Authority, and that the authority had paid salaries to terrorists imprisoned in Israel and had made martyr payments to the families of suicide bombers.\nThe Palestinian Authority and the P.L.O. said in a statement that they were “deeply disappointed” in the verdict, calling the lawsuit’s charges “baseless.”\n“We will appeal this decision,” Dr. Mahmoud Khalifa, the Palestinian Authority’s deputy minister of information, said in the statement. “We are confident that we will prevail, as we have faith in the U.S. legal system and are certain about our common sense belief and our strong legal standing.”\n“This case is just the latest attempt by hard-line antipeace factions in Israel to use and abuse the U.S. legal system to advance their narrow political and ideological agenda,” Dr. Khalifa added.\nHe also called the decision “a tragic disservice to the millions of Palestinians who have invested in the democratic process and the rule of law in order to seek justice and redress their grievances.”\nLawyers for the plaintiffs said they could seek orders to have the defendants’ bank accounts frozen and to require them to turn over real estate and other property. The judgments could also be taken to other countries, where the defendants do business or have assets, Mr. Yalowitz, one of the lawyers, said.\n“Once you have a judgment, the P.A. and the P.L.O., if they don’t pay, are like any other deadbeat debtor,” he said.\nThe Palestinian Authority, led by Mahmoud Abbas, had serious financial troubles even before Israel, as punishment for the Palestinians’ move in December to join the International Criminal Court, began withholding more than $100 million a month in tax revenue it collects on the Palestinians’ behalf.\nNitsana Darshan-Leitner, another of the families’ lawyers, said the plaintiffs would also go after those taxes.\n“And we are going to put pressure on those who are negotiating with them, with those who have relationships with them to make sure that the Palestinian Authority respects the American law, respects an American jury ruling, and pay their debt,” Ms. Darshan-Leitner said.\n“Our goal is to get this judgment paid. We did this before. We are going to do it this time again.”","[""Money is oxygen for terrorism.""]",1359,7,0.01359,0.00021,0.0138
"On Friday evening, Boris Nemtsov, a Russian opposition leader and former first deputy prime minister under Boris Yeltsin, went on a prominent Moscow radio station to exhort his fellow citizens to come out to protest President Vladimir Putin’s policies. There would be a rally on Sunday, a spring march, to demonstrate against the deepening economic crisis and Russia’s involvement in Ukraine. The most prominent Russian opposition leader, Aleksei Navalny, had been put in jail for 15 days, which just happened to be long enough to keep him from attending the rally. Nemtsov, who was older and, by now, less influential, had handed out leaflets in the metro and encouraged people to come anyway.\nAfter the radio show, on which Nemtsov warned that too much power in the hands of one man would “end in catastrophe,” he met Anna Duritskaya, his girlfriend of three years — and, as the police would later pointedly note, a citizen of Ukraine. They had dinner and then headed home, strolling across Red Square and past the swirling domes of St. Basil’s Cathedral, adjacent to the Kremlin. Just before midnight, as they crossed the bridge toward the historic Moscow neighborhood where Nemtsov lived, a white car pulled up, and, according to investigators, someone inside fired seven or eight shots. Four of them hit Nemtsov in the head, heart, liver and stomach, killing him on the spot.\nDuritskaya was unharmed and immediately taken in for questioning. Nemtsov, a big, broad man, was left on the pavement in the rain, his shirt yanked up to his chin.\nOn Russian social media, liberal Moscow has struggled to wrap its head around something that seemed like it simply couldn’t happen, until it did. It had been years since Nemtsov, a rising star in Yeltsin-era politics, had been the standard-bearer of Western liberalism, and he could be a silly bon vivant. But he was deeply intelligent, witty, kind and ubiquitous. He seemed to genuinely be everyone’s friend; when I lived in Moscow as a journalist, he was always willing to jaw over endless glasses of cognac. And he was a powerful, vigorous critic of Vladimir Putin, assailing him in every possible medium, constantly publishing reports on topics like the president’s lavish lifestyle and the corruption behind the Sochi Olympics.\nHow could such a prominent politician — a founder of the opposition Solidarity Party, a sitting member of the Yaroslavl city parliament — be gunned down so brazenly, within steps of the Kremlin? “We didn’t kill members of government,” Gleb Pavlovsky, an independent political consultant who used to work for Putin, told me over the phone. “It’s an absolutely new situation.” Olga Romanova, a prominent opposition activist and a close friend of Nemtsov, said, “There are more cameras in that spot than there are grains in a packet of grain.” When I called her last night, she had just come from the scene of the crime, where her friend still lay on the ground, surrounded by laughing policemen. “It’s the first time I’ve seen a very close person murdered, lying on the pavement,” she said. “It’s terrifying.”\nPutin promptly called Nemtsov’s mother to offer his condolences and threw what seemed like the entire Ministry of Internal Affairs on the case. Yet we can be sure that the investigation will lead precisely nowhere. At most, some sad sap, the supposed trigger-puller, will be hauled in front of a judge, the scapegoat for someone far more powerful. More likely, the case will founder for years amid promises that everyone is working hard, and no one will be brought to justice at all. This has been the pattern for other high-profile killings, like those of the journalist Anna Politkovskaya and the whistle-blower Sergei Magnitsky.\nAlready, the Kremlin is muddying the waters. Immediately after the shooting, Putin’s press secretary called the killing “a provocation.” This morning, he clarified that there was no political motive behind the murder. LifeNews, a publication with close ties to Russia’s security agencies, has suggested three possible theories that are under investigation: The killing might have been revenge for forcing Duritskaya to get an abortion; it might have had something to do with money Nemtsov was receiving from allies abroad; or it might have been an attempt to smear the Kremlin. By afternoon, the government’s Investigative Committee had issued a statement saying it believed Nemtsov may have been killed by someone from his own opposition movement who wanted to create a martyr. There was even a suggestion that the assassination was connected to the Charlie Hebdo killings.\nEven if one of these theories were true, none of Moscow’s embattled liberals would be convinced. “I will never believe it,” Yevgenia Albats, editor of the liberal magazine New Times and an old friend of Nemtsov, told me. “This is not about some domestic affair. These were absolute professionals.” Ilya Yashin, a member of Nemtsov’s Solidarity Party, was of the same mind. “It’s totally obvious for me that it’s a political killing,” he said. “I don’t have the slightest doubt about that.” Maxim Katz, another opposition activist, claimed on Twitter that, any way you slice it, Putin is responsible: “If he ordered it, then he’s guilty as the orderer. And even if he didn’t, then [he is responsible] as the inciter of hatred, hysteria, and anger among the people.”\nIt’s hard to argue with this last point. Putin’s aggressive foreign policy, his increasingly conservative domestic policy, his labeling the opposition a “fifth column” and “national traitors,” his state television whipping up a militant, nationalistic fervor — all of this creates a certain atmosphere. Putin, after all, has a history of playing with fire, only to have the flames get away from him. After years of the Kremlin tacitly supporting ultranationalist, neo-Nazi groups, the same skinheads staged a violent protest at the foot of the Kremlin walls in 2010 while riot police officers stood by and watched helplessly. Today, a rabid nationalism has swallowed up most of the country, and it is no longer clear that Putin can control it. “In this kind of atmosphere, everything is possible,” Pavlovsky told me. “This is a Weimar atmosphere. There are no longer any limits.”\nUntil relatively recently, the risks opposition activists knew they were taking on were not generally thought to be life-threatening. The government was likely to hassle activists and make their lives uncomfortable, but mostly it just marginalized them, like the town fool. This began to change with the arrests of protesters in the summer of 2012. When Navalny was sentenced to five years in prison a year later, it came as a shock; this had never been done before. Even after the sentence was suspended, it seemed to be a warning to the opposition.\nNemtsov’s assassination took that warning to its logical conclusion. Now, “we live in a different political reality,” tweeted Leonid Volkov, a prominent opposition activist. “The fact that they killed him is a message to frighten everyone, the brave and the not brave,” Yashin said. “That this is what happens to people who go against the government of our country.” Anatoly Chubais — who, like Nemtsov, served in the Yeltsin government, and who remains close to Putin — visited the site of the shooting this morning. “If, just a few days ago, people in our city are carrying signs that say ‘Let’s finish off the fifth column,’ and today they kill Nemtsov,” he said in a statement, referring to the Kremlin-sponsored anti-Maidan protest in Moscow last weekend, “what will happen tomorrow?” Or, as Albats put it, “Hunting season is open.”\nNemtsov had been confiding to friends of late that he was growing frightened. This summer, he went to Israel to hide out for a few months, fearing arrest. He told Albats that he worried he wouldn’t be able to withstand a stint in a Russian penal colony. In the fall, he filed a police report because of threats he was receiving on social media. It didn’t seem to go anywhere. Recently, he even let his bravado slip in public, telling an interviewer two weeks ago that he was scared Putin would kill him.\nAnd yet, he didn’t let up. According to Albats and Yashin, Nemtsov was working on a particularly incendiary report that he planned to call “Putin and Ukraine,” which would trace the stream of weaponry flowing from Russia to separatists in the Donbass. He was meeting with the families of Russian men who had died fighting with the separatists. He kept up his withering attacks on Facebook and Twitter. He kept traveling to Ukraine and meeting with president Petro Poroshenko, something that couldn’t have gone unnoticed by the Kremlin’s security agencies. And still, Nemtsov never hired a bodyguard. He walked home through Moscow late at night unprotected.\nAnd he almost made it. His apartment building was visible from the bridge. “From his window, where he worked out in the mornings, you can see the place where he was killed,” Romanova told me. “For many years, he saw the place where they would kill him.”","[""Too much power in the hands of one man can lead to catastrophe.""]",2090,15,0.0209,0.00045,0.021349999999999997
"SELMA, Ala. — As a new generation struggles over race and power in America, President Obama and a host of political figures from both parties arrived here on Saturday, to the site of one of the most searing days of the civil rights era, to reflect on how far the country has come and how far it still has to go.\nFifty years after peaceful protesters trying to cross a bridge were beaten by police officers with billy clubs, shocking the nation and leading to passage of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, the nation’s first African-American president was to lead a bipartisan, multiracial testimonial to the pioneers whose courage helped pave the way for his own election to the highest office of the land.\nBut coming just days after Mr. Obama’s Justice Department excoriated the police department of Ferguson, Mo., as a hotbed of racist oppression, even as it cleared a white officer in the killing of an unarmed black teenager, the anniversary seemed more than a commemoration of long-ago events on a black-and-white newsreel. Instead, it provided a moment to measure the country’s far narrower, and yet stubbornly persistent, divide in black-and-white reality.\n“Selma is not just about commemorating the past,” Mr. Obama told an audience at a historically black college in South Carolina on Friday before heading to what he called a “sacred place” here. “It’s about honoring the legends who helped change this country and through your actions today, in the here and now. Selma is now. Selma is about the courage of ordinary people doing extraordinary things because they believe they can change the country, that they can shape our nation’s destiny.”\nSet to join Mr. Obama at the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Saturday were his Republican predecessor, former President George W. Bush, who signed the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act in 2006, as well as more than 100 members of Congress, about two dozen of them Republican. Although no member of the congressional Republican leadership was initially planning to come, Senator Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina who is black, and others lobbied for a strong turnout. Late Friday, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican majority leader, announced he would join the commemoration.\nSpeaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, did not plan to come, nor did Senator Harry M. Reid of Nevada, the Democratic minority leader. But the Republican-led Congress voted to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the “foot soldiers” of Bloody Sunday and other related events as “an expression of our affection and admiration for those who risked everything for their rights,” as Mr. Boehner put it.\nGov. Robert Bentley, a Republican, was among those scheduled to speak on Saturday. He said he hoped to use the occasion to show how much Alabama has changed.\n“We want people in America and the world to realize that Alabama is a different place and a different state than it was 50 years ago,” Mr. Bentley said in an interview. “It has become probably as much of a colorblind state as any state in the country, and we’re very proud of the advancement we’ve made.”\nBut that was not a universal view in a state where Mr. Obama received just 15 percent of the white vote in 2012.\n“I think in many ways we’ve gone backwards on race in this country,” former Representative Artur Davis of Alabama, who is African-American and switched parties to become a Republican, said in an interview. “There’s obviously a very deep racial divide in Alabama when it comes to President Obama. Black voters are very, very proud of this president, and many white voters in Alabama are very critical of this president. Alabama is one of the most racially polarized states in the country.”\nAlabama is also on the front lines of what some see as the modern-day successor to the civil rights movement. Despite a federal court decision throwing out the state’s ban on same-sex marriage, Alabama’s Supreme Court has tried to block the issuance of marriage certificates, leading to confusion across the state. It said the federal ruling was an intrusion on states’ rights. White House officials said earlier in the week that they were not sure whether Mr. Obama would address the dispute on Saturday.\nThe events of March 7, 1965, proved one of the turning points in the crusade for equal rights for African-Americans, popularized most recently in the widely acclaimed if historically debated movie “Selma.” The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders decided to make a stand for voting rights in Selma, where few blacks had been allowed to register, and weeks of protests and arrests led to a decision to march 50 miles to the state capital, Montgomery.\nWhen about 600 mostly black demonstrators crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, named for a Confederate general turned grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, state troopers and Sheriff Jim Clark’s posse attacked them with billy clubs and tear gas. Among the dozens injured was John Lewis, who suffered a skull fracture. National revulsion helped President Lyndon B. Johnson push the Voting Rights Act through Congress within five months.\nNow a longtime member of Congress, Mr. Lewis planned to be among those on hand on Saturday as part of several days of festivities known as the Bridge Crossing Jubilee. The activities began on Thursday, blending solemn remembrance, political workshops and a county fair-style diversion at which a Miss Jubilee Pageant winner was crowned. Friday featured a golf tournament, a mock trial and sessions on education.\nConcerts were planned as well, including a show Sunday sponsored by Centric/BET Networks featuring Harry Belafonte; Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary; Cicely Tyson; the rappers Rick Ross, Vanilla Ice, Flava Flav and Doug E. Fresh; and the musical acts Bell Biv DeVoe and the Blind Boys of Alabama.\nA voting rights workshop was scheduled for Saturday afternoon, highlighting the continuing battle over the law. The Supreme Court struck down the heart of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, freeing nine states, including Alabama, to change their election laws without advance approval, in effect ruling that it was no longer suited to changing political times and based on outdated assumptions and data. The political parties have been fighting in various states over laws requiring identification at polling places and limiting advance voting.\nBut Mr. Obama’s success in American politics has also helped draw African-Americans into the electoral system. In 2012, with Mr. Obama on the ballot, the voter turnout percentage among blacks was higher than among whites for a presidential election for the first time in American history.\nFor this day, Mr. Scott, one of two African-Americans in the Senate and co-chairman of the Selma commemoration, said the two parties should put aside their policy differences and focus on the “the shoulders of giants” today’s political leaders stand on.\n“Frankly, what we should focus on is the importance of this experience of bringing Americans together,” he said in an interview. “By doing so, hopefully we’ll have a nonpartisan experience that leads to greater rapport, more credibility and a common understanding that leads to real progress for the next generation.”\nA picture caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified the city in Alabama where President Obama was photographed.

"COLUMBIA, S.C. — Out on the presidential campaign trail, Gov. Scott Walker has left “Wiscahnsin” back home in Wisconsin. He now wants to strengthen the economy, not the “ecahnahmy.” And while he once had the “ahnor” of meeting fellow Republicans, he told one group here this week that he simply enjoyed “talkin’ with y’all.”\nThe classic Upper Midwest accent – nasal and full of flat a’s – is one of several Walker trademarks to have fallen away this month after an intense period of strategizing and coaching designed to help Mr. Walker capitalize on his popularity in early polls and show that he is not some provincial politician out of his depth.\nHe is tailoring his pitch to his audiences — wearing pullover sweaters in earth-tone colors in one early primary state, New Hampshire, and discussing the power of prayer in another, here in South Carolina. He has reined in his rambling speeches, at least compared with his recorded remarks over the years. He is trying to listen more and opine less, political associates say, and he is easygoing with voters — a contrast with his pugilistic reputation from his successful battle against Wisconsin labor unions, which made him a hero to many conservatives.\n“When I told Governor Walker that I went to the University of Alabama, he started rattling off Alabama players on the Green Bay Packers,” said Rod Benfield, a South Carolina Republican who came away from a state party fund-raising event here on Thursday “very impressed” with Mr. Walker. “We talked football for five minutes. Politics never came up.”\nNo other Republican considering a run for the presidency is under as much pressure to show he can vault from statewide popularity to top-tier national contention as Mr. Walker, who has stirred keen interest from party leaders and donors as well as voters.\nIs he a durable candidate with wide appeal? Or is he a flavor of the month — as former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Herman Cain were during the Republican nominating contests in 2012 — or a firebrand peaking too early, as Howard Dean did before the 2004 Democratic primaries?\n“Walker has to show that his message goes beyond Wisconsin, that he is big enough — presidential enough — to handle national and international issues,” said Bill Barlow, another Republican who attended the event on Thursday to check out the Wisconsin governor, who prevailed in a 2012 recall election. “I think he can — he’s won three governor’s races in a Democratic state — but it’s early.”\nMr. Walker and his advisers were caught off guard, his associates say, by the momentum that built after some well-received speeches this winter and the strong showings in several recent polls. In South Carolina this week and in New Hampshire last weekend, he lowered his public profile, largely avoiding reporters to focus on private meetings with Republicans.\nEarlier encounters with the media left some political commentators saying he was unprepared for a national campaign. During a trip to London, he sidestepped foreign policy questions and declined to say if he agreed with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, that President Obama did not love America. He has also been criticized for changing some positions — most clearly on immigration — and seeming to cave into political pressure by letting go of a consultant who criticized the Iowa caucuses, which are the first nominating contests.\n“Every stumble Walker’s had this winter are times when he was pushed to talk about issues he didn’t want to talk about or face things he didn’t want to face,” said Charles Franklin, a Wisconsin political analyst and director of the Marquette Law School Poll. “Walker has always been able to stick to his issues, but the national stage is going to test him to go deep on a range of issues that any president faces.”\nWhile Mr. Walker is best known for his successful fight to strip many collective bargaining rights from most public sector unions in Wisconsin and his subsequent recall victory, he now brings up that dispute chiefly to thank people who prayed for his family while it was going on. But many voters still see him as a one-issue governor, as do his political opponents.\n“Scott Walker won’t have a chance to win New Hampshire if he keeps attacking unions, because unions have helped generations of people here get ahead,” said William Shaheen, who has helped run Democratic presidential campaigns in New Hampshire and is married to Senator Jeanne Shaheen.\nAides to Mr. Walker declined several requests for an interview with him this month. But his spokeswoman, Kirsten Kukowski, described him as “one of the most battle-tested governors in the country” who wanted to take “reform-minded principles and highlight them to Republicans across the country.”\nTo compete with possible Republican contenders who have more experience with foreign policy or federal issues, Mr. Walker is now being tutored by experts. He is also receiving coaching from his likely campaign manager, Rick Wiley, and others to improve his speeches and enhance his ability to connect with voters.\n“The governor isn’t going to light up a lot of rooms, though he’s also not going to leave a room until he meets every person,” said William J. McCoshen, a prominent Republican consultant in Wisconsin who is friendly with the Walker team. “His delivery has always been a plain-talk approach. Emotionally engaging with an audience generally hasn’t been his style.”\nThat is starting to change. After Mr. Walker delivered a long and limp speech behind a podium to the Republican National Committee in January, Mr. Wiley and others helped the governor hone a shorter stump speech for his next big event, a week later at the Iowa Freedom Summit. Mr. Walker, who was used to writing his own remarks, practiced the speech and sought guidance about adding energy and emotion and sharpening his diction.\nThe Iowa speech was deeply personal, with Mr. Walker going into detail about death threats he said he had received (“one said they were gonna gut my wife like a deer”) during the battle with organized labor, and he crisscrossed the stage to look a variety of audience members in the eye.\nThe speech was a hit with Republicans, and in late February Mr. Walker was the clear leader in a Quinnipiac poll of likely Republican caucus voters in Iowa. He also performed solidly at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, then traveled to New Hampshire for his first appearance there as a potential presidential candidate.\nIn many ways, Mr. Walker demonstrated an instinctual grasp of the state. In addition to wearing the pullover sweaters, he focused on an anti-tax message certain to resonate with conservatives and independents in a place where opposition to taxes has long been a litmus test for Democrats as well as Republicans.\nDuring a speech in Concord last Saturday, he spoke about his “obsession with lower taxes” and championed “common sense Republican conservative principles,” in sync with the pragmatic small-government views of many state residents.\nDuring meetings with Republican officials, activists, and the publisher of The New Hampshire Union Leader, Mr. Walker sought to be a good listener and an eager student of local politics, said his advisers, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings and to candidly assess the governor’s needs as a possible candidate. Mr. Walker took the same approach in South Carolina, seeking advice from Gov. Nikki R. Haley, and fielding questions from state lawmakers and Republican officials.\n“I wasn’t sure what to expect when I first met him, or if he would fit in easily outside the Midwest,” said Matt Moore, chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party. “But he’s very down-to-earth, approachable. He fits in down south. He’s a blue-collar kind of guy with a real moral clarity. And he doesn’t talk about just Wisconsin. He really connects it to the needs of America.”\nStill, Mr. Walker has yet to move beyond his comfort zone of fellow Republicans and conservatives. He has not held a town hall-style meeting with cross-sections of voters who might challenge him on national issues.\nBut he’s been making headway at dinners like one organized by Jennifer Horn, the chairwoman of the New Hampshire Republican Party, describing the coffees and house parties he did on the campaign trail in Wisconsin — the sort of retail politics expected of presidential candidates in the state. He traded stories about raising children — his two sons are now in college — and told a favorite anecdote about buying much of his clothing at a discount at Kohl’s.\nAnd at the dinner, as well as in his Concord speech, his Wisconsin honk was noticeably absent.\n“I didn’t hear it,” Ms. Horn said. “Good for him, good for him.”","[""Politicians often tailor their speech and appearance to connect with different audiences.""]",1915,15,0.01915,0.00045,0.0196
"The extraordinary circumstances that led to last week’s crash of the Germanwings jet, where a pilot seemingly brought down an airplane, killing everyone aboard, means that the airline’s insurers could end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars to the victims’ families, according to legal experts.\nBut while the airline is responsible for the actions of its pilot, not all relatives will be entitled to the same payout. The families of the three American victims, for instance, are likely to get a larger payment from the airline than other passengers because courts in the United States usually award larger compensation than European courts.\nUnder the 1999 Montreal Convention, an international treaty that governs airplane liability, airlines are responsible in cases of accidental death or injury on international flights, and must pay families up to about $170,000 per victim. The definition of an accident is broad and includes any unusual or unexpected event that causes a deadly crash.\nBut since the pilot intentionally caused the crash, according to the French prosecutor, relatives could also seek greater compensation from the airline, aviation lawyers said.\n“It is sad, it is tragic, but it is extremely straightforward,” said Robert Alpert Sr., a veteran aviation lawyer who has handled cases involving more than 40 crashes. “The airline and its insurer should quickly handle the payments to the families. Particularly in light of the fact that they apparently dropped the ball in monitoring this pilot’s physical and mental well-being.”\nThe authorities have said that Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot at the controls of the Airbus A320 jetliner that crashed in the French Alps on Tuesday, had a mental illness but kept the diagnosis hidden from his employer. He and the other 149 people on board the plane died when it slammed into a mountain.\nJames Healy-Pratt, a partner and head of the aviation department at Stewarts Law in London, estimated the airline’s total liability would be about $350 million to the families of the passengers.\n“It would be commercial suicide for Germanwings to try and dispute responsibility to the families,” Mr. Healy-Pratt said. “I am surprised that Lufthansa have been so defensive so far. I would expect that common sense will prevail soon.”\nHans Joachim Schöttes, a spokesman for Germanwings, said over the weekend that the victims’ families would start receiving initial payments in the coming days. Germanwings, owned by Lufthansa, said it had set aside 50,000 euros, or about $54,000, for each family to cover immediate expenses. Lufthansa said it would honor its responsibilities to the families.\nHow much each family gets in the end will vary. The families of passengers with children or dependents would be entitled to a larger payment than those of elderly passengers or passengers with no dependent relatives.\nAs to where families can seek compensation, there are several options: the airline’s home country; the country where the flight was to land; the country in which the ticket was bought; the country of final destination; or the passenger’s country of residence.\nPassengers aboard the Germanwings plane, which was flying from Barcelona, Spain, to Düsseldorf, Germany, came from more than 16 countries, including 71 passenger from Germany and 48 from Spain.\nThe Montreal Convention places no limits on compensation, instead leaving it to national courts to decide how much money is appropriate for the loss of a relative. (The convention, however, does not permit punitive damages to be awarded.)\nThe national approaches vary widely. Some countries do not allow compensation for wrongful-death cases. Courts in the United States, on the other hand, are generally highly favorable to families.\nAn airline can avoid paying families more than a minimal sum if it can prove it was in no way at fault for a crash. In practice, the standard is nearly impossible to meet in an accident. “In this case, of course, it will be impossible for the airline to prove it was completely free of fault,” said Mike Danko, a plaintiff’s aviation lawyer in California.\nRegulators in the United States require airlines to always have two crew members in the cockpit at any time, something that was not required in Europe until now.\nOn Friday, the European Aviation Safety Agency, based in Cologne, Germany, formally advised airlines across the region to adopt a rule that two people must be in a cockpit. It said the recommendation was temporary, pending the outcome of the French investigation into the crash.\n“The airline is liable to pay unlimited full compensation because they failed to do everything to prevent this tragedy,” said Mr. Healy-Pratt.\nLufthansa’s top executive has said that Mr. Lubitz was fit to fly. However, the authorities in Germany found that he did not disclose his full medical records despite a company policy requiring notification of conditions that could affect flying or a pilot’s license.\nHe also sought treatment for vision problems that may have jeopardized his ability to continue working as a pilot, two officials with knowledge of the investigation said on Saturday.\n“There is no requirement they should have known more about him, but he was their agent, and the airline is responsible for his actions,” said Kevin P. Durkin, a partner at Clifford Law Offices in Chicago and former chairman of the American Bar Association’s aviation section.\nIn the United States, families could expect payouts of more than $10 million, depending on a person’s specific circumstances, age, occupation and earning power, according to Mr. Danko, who has represented families of victims of the Air France Concorde crash in 2000, and American Airlines Flight 587, which crashed in Queens in November 2001.\nBut a federal court in California, after the crash of Air France Flight 447, sent the case of two American families back to France, where most cases were being heard, Mr. Danko said.\nStill, most cases are settled out of court. For that reason, airlines usually look at where passengers might be able to sue, and offer them compensation that is commensurate with what a court there might award them, Mr. Danko said.\nThis explains why Europeans would get less, says Kenneth R. Feinberg, a lawyer and victim compensation expert, since “the idea you’ll get hundreds of thousands, or millions, of dollars is alien to the way Europe compensates.”\nGerman courts, for instance, approve payouts that cover the cost of burial for the victims or psychological help for their relatives, as well as alimony or child support. But the total payments are usually a small fraction of what families in America might get.\nMr. Healy-Pratt, said settlements in air disasters average $4.5 million for an American case, $1.6 million for a British case, $1.4 million for a Spanish case, and $1.3 million for a German case.\nExperts say that whatever the findings in last week’s crash, the insurance coverage should easily cover its potential liabilities. Germanwings is insured by a pool of insurers led by Allianz.\n“One of the hardest parts of my job is explaining to British families that their claims are worth much less than American families’, and to German families that theirs are worth less than Spanish families’,” Mr. Healy-Pratt said. “After all, most passengers will have endured similar experiences during the final long minutes of Flight 9525.”","[""Airlines are responsible in cases of accidental death or injury on international flights.""]",1644,16,0.01644,0.00048,0.01692
"In the nearly eight months after utility workers found evidence of a leaking unauthorized tap on a gas line in an East Village building, the city never sent an inspector to make sure the dangerous activity had not recurred.\nThe reason, city officials say, was simple: They were never aware of any potential hazard.\nNow, the building is gone — the site of a fiery explosion on March 26 that destroyed much of the block and left two men dead. The police and criminal prosecutors believe the blast may have been caused by the continued tapping of a gas line there.\nBut even without a definitive conclusion, the way in which an inappropriate and dangerous gas situation at 121 Second Avenue was handled has exposed what many consider to be a gap in the flow of information between the utility companies and the New York City Department of Buildings. The only notification about the leak discovered in August came a month later in a routine filing from Consolidated Edison, which was all the utility was required to share with the city.\nNow, in a tacit acknowledgment of the shortcomings in the current procedures, city officials are moving to sharpen their inspection efforts and improve communication with Con Edison.\n“The reports are very mechanical,” Anthony E. Shorris, the city’s first deputy mayor, said of the notifications from the utility. “There has to be ways to make that faster, more automated and more useful for us in terms of targeting where we might send out additional inspection units.”\nMr. Shorris said the city hoped to conduct inspections “in a more focused way,” with plans to single out “people who have a history of problematic behavior” based on violation records and other factors.\n“We’ll work with the city on any new processes they are considering,” said Michael Clendenin, a spokesman for Con Ed. “The safety of all residents is our primary concern.”\nThe current system involves random inspections and relies heavily on Con Edison and other utilities to assume responsibility for stopping potentially hazardous situations. The changes Mr. Shorris proposed could lead to closer scrutiny of buildings like 121 Second Avenue and their owners, though it is not clear that such changes would have prevented the recent explosion.\nBy all accounts from officials of the city and Con Edison, what happened there on Aug. 6 followed all of the existing rules and regulations.\nA Con Edison worker smelled natural gas in the basement while reading the meter and called for help. Firefighters and utility inspectors arrived and found that a flexible hose had been attached to the gas line that served a restaurant on the ground floor, Sushi Park, and it was leaking.\nDeeming this a “hazardous situation,” the Con Edison workers shut off the valve that allowed gas to flow into the building and demanded the removal of the tap, which appeared to be diverting gas to apartments upstairs. As is customary in the utility industry, the company’s inspectors hung a red cardboard tag on the line to indicate it had been shut off.\nA copy of the tag, which contained information about when and why the service was disrupted, was given to the manager of the restaurant, which was Con Edison’s only customer in that building. The tag would remain on the main valve until Con Edison approved the work a private plumber had done to fix the leak.\nCon Edison restored the service on Aug. 15, nine days after it was shut off. A few weeks later, the company included the building in an extensive list of locations where gas was shut down, according to city officials. That citation said only that a leak had been found; it did not mention the unauthorized tapping\nMr. Shorris said that “if Con Ed finds anything that’s illegal or inappropriate, of course they tell us,” but acknowledged the “long lag time” on reports from the utility. He added that the reports often include scant detail about the circumstances of a shutdown.\nMr. Shorris did note, though, that the restoration of gas service cannot be done without a licensed master plumber self-certifying the work, a Con Ed engineer inspecting the site and another utility worker checking the meter.\nThe city currently conducts random inspections of self-certified jobs, he said. Other inspections often take place in response to complaints from residents or other agencies.\nAccording to Buildings Department records, the city issued 112 violations last year for the supplying of gas to buildings without inspections, but officials say there are undoubtedly more instances of gas being inappropriately used that are not detected.\nThe department has been a punching bag of sorts for the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has sought to reduce bureaucratic malaise and speed up inspections.\nDuring his State of the City address in February, Mr. de Blasio recalled his days on the City Council, where members are inundated with complaints about the department.\nSome changes had already been in the works before the explosion. The de Blasio administration said it was investing $17.4 million over two years, with plans to hire new inspectors and engineers. A position of “risk management officer” was also created.\nSince last year, a trade group of plumbers has also pressed the administration to enhance its enforcement efforts.\n“The industry is under the serious impression that D.O.B. does a very poor job investigating and disciplining unscrupulous licensed plumbers as well as enforcement actions against unlicensed individuals/firms performing plumbing work,” according to a December letter from the group, the Plumbing Foundation City of New York. On March 25, the night before the explosion on Second Avenue, the city’s buildings commissioner, Rick D. Chandler, met with the plumbing group at a restaurant in Queens to address its concerns.\nMr. Chandler agreed that the department could improve its enforcement of unlicensed work, said Steward D. O’Brien, the group’s executive director.\n“He said: ‘Listen, you guys are right. We need to do more,’ ” Mr. O’Brien recalled.\nIn other places, government agencies and utility companies treat reports of emergency gas shut-offs with more urgency.\nUnitil, a distributor of gas and electricity based in New Hampshire, sends special notices to local gas inspectors and state regulators whenever it shuts off gas service out of a concern for safety, said Carol Valianti, a spokeswoman for the company.\nEach time Unitil workers place a red tag on a customer’s pipe, the company sends a form explaining why the gas was shut off by registered mail to the customer and to the local inspector, Ms. Valianti said. The company is required to report shut-offs to New Hampshire’s Public Utilities Commission, she said, adding that it fulfills that obligation through emails that are generated automatically.\nIn New Hampshire, Ms. Valianti said, the company cannot restore the service until the local gas inspector has approved the repairs.\nWhile it may not be feasible to have as many layers of inspection in New York City, some experts said that distinguishing serious hazards from less-dangerous situations could help.\nMark McDonald, a former gas-utility worker who investigates gas explosions, said he routinely drew attention to situations like the one Con Edison stumbled upon. Whenever he found evidence of an attempt to tap a gas line or steal gas from his employer — “something that’s considered a hazard that we’ve interrupted” — he would go beyond the requirement to fill out a red tag, he said.\n“If they did it once, they may do it again,” said Mr. McDonald, the president of NatGas Consulting in Massachusetts. “I would pick up the phone in that situation and call the city inspector, just for the safety of the people who don’t know what’s going on.

"There is no question that Donna Lou Rayhons had severe Alzheimer’s.\nIn the days before being placed in a nursing home in Garner, Iowa, last year, Mrs. Rayhons, 78, could not recall her daughters’ names or how to eat a hamburger. One day, she tried to wash her hands in the toilet of a restaurant bathroom.\nBut another question has become the crux of an extraordinary criminal case unfolding this week in an Iowa courtroom: Was Mrs. Rayhons able to consent to sex with her husband?\nHenry Rayhons, 78, has been charged with third-degree felony sexual abuse, accused of having sex with his wife in a nursing home on May 23, 2014, eight days after staff members there told him they believed she was mentally unable to agree to sex.\nIt is rare, possibly unprecedented, for such circumstances to prompt criminal charges. Mr. Rayhons, a nine-term Republican state legislator, decided not to seek another term after his arrest.\nThere is no allegation that Mrs. Rayhons resisted or showed signs of abuse. And it is widely agreed that the Rayhonses had a loving, affectionate relationship, having married in 2007 after each had been widowed. They met while singing in a church choir.\nThe case pivots on longstanding medical and ethical concerns that will become only more pressing as the population ages and rates of dementia rise. How can anyone determine whether a person with dementia can say yes to sex? Who has the right to decide?\n“It really is a huge issue, and somewhere down the line we’re going to have to confront it,” said Derek Beeston, a social work professor at Staffordshire University in England who has studied sex and dementia.\nMrs. Rayhons, who died in August, was placed in the Concord Care Center in March 2014, soon after one of her daughters, Linda Dunshee, was called to pick her up at the Iowa State Capitol, where Mr. Rayhons was working. Ms. Dunshee found her mother wearing lingerie and unzipped pants under her coat.\nDetails about the case come from interviews, court records and news media reports. At the care center, Mr. Rayhons, a corn and soybean farmer, visited his wife morning and evening, sometimes praying the rosary by her bed. But documents and interviews suggest he opposed some staff recommendations, including limiting outside trips, like attending a friend’s funeral at an unfamiliar church.\nMichelle Dornbier, a social worker at the center, and Dr. John Boedeker, Mrs. Rayhons’s family doctor, testified on Friday about her scores on a test to assess memory and orientation. In May 2014, she scored zero, unable to recall the words “sock,” “bed” and “blue.”\nBut Ms. Dornbier acknowledged that Mrs. Rayhons “was always pleased to see Henry.” And Dr. Boedeker acknowledged that “intimacy is beneficial for dementia patients.”\nMs. Dornbier testified that the Concord Care Center allows consensual sex between residents. But she said that on May 15, 2014, family members including Mr. Rayhons were given a “care plan” establishing simple routines for Mrs. Rayhons, including limiting outings with Mr. Rayhons mostly to church on Sunday.\nMs. Dornbier, prompted by what she called concerns from Mrs. Rayhons’s daughter Suzan Brunes, that Mr. Rayhons was engaging in inappropriate sexual contact, wrote at the bottom of the plan: “Given Donna’s cognitive state, do you feel she is able to give consent for any sexual activity?”\nThe center’s doctor, Dr. John Brady, wrote: “No.” Mr. Rayhons was told the recommendation against having sex and indicated it would not be a problem, according to Ms. Dunshee.\nOn May 23, Mrs. Rayhons was moved from a private room to a double. That evening, her roommate reported that Mr. Rayhons drew the curtain around his wife’s bed and that sexual noises were heard. Later a security camera recorded Mr. Rayhons dropping his wife’s underwear into a hallway laundry bag after leaving her room.\nSoon after, Ms. Brunes successfully petitioned for guardianship of her mother. The petition did not mention sexual activity, but said that Mr. Rayhons disregarded staff members’ recommendations, including that he not visit his wife’s room because of “conflicts with her roommate.”\nIn an interview with a state investigator, Mr. Rayhons said that his wife still enjoyed and occasionally asked for sex, but he did not remember having sex in the shared room that night. The investigator implied, apparently erroneously, to Mr. Rayhons that cameras had recorded sexual activity, which seemed to persuade him to acknowledge having had relations.\nMrs. Rayhons was moved to another facility run by the same company, which has a special dementia unit. Her daughter limited Mr. Rayhons’s visits. He was arrested soon after she died.\nThe case is being tried by the Iowa attorney general’s office because of Mr. Rayhons’s prominence in the county. The attorney general’s office, the Concord Care Home, Mrs. Rayhons’s daughters and their lawyer declined to comment while the case is pending.\nSex is one of the most ambiguous areas in the scientific understanding of Alzheimer’s. While there are established methods of measuring memory, reasoning and the ability to dress, bathe and balance checkbooks, no widely used method exists for assessing the ability to consent to intimate relations.\nOne obstacle: Dementia’s symptoms fluctuate. Patients may be relatively lucid in the morning and significantly impaired in the afternoon.\n“What may be appropriate on one day may not be appropriate the next week, or at a different point that same day,” said Ann Christine Frankowski, associate director of the Center for Aging Studies at University of Maryland, Baltimore County.\nYet desire may survive long after names and faces are forgotten. Physical intimacy can benefit dementia patients, experts say, calming agitation, easing loneliness and possibly aiding physical health.\n“Touch is one of the last pleasures we lose,” said Daniel Reingold, chief executive of the Hebrew Home at Riverdale, in the Bronx, which pioneered a “sexual rights policy” for residents in 1995. “So much of aging and so much of being in a long-term care facility is about loss, loss of independence, loss of friends, loss of ability to use your body. Why would we want to diminish that?”\nSeveral experts described intimacy as an almost primal instinct, like eating. “Wanting to have sex is a bit like being hungry or being thirsty,” Dr. Beeston said.\nUnless people are in a “vegetative” state, said Patricia M. Speck, a forensic nurse at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Nursing, “there’s a lot of things they might not be able to do like money and time and recognition of children, but they have the capacity for self-determination and intimate relationships.”\nGayle Doll, director of the Center on Aging at Kansas State University, said a person with dementia might not assent with words, but with body language or facial expression.\n“In a nursing home, it doesn’t happen like ‘wham bam thank you ma’am,’ ” she said. “The staff, they know the cues, they know what’s happening in the person’s relationship.”\nDr. Doll trains facilities in practices like knocking before entering residents’ rooms. One home even put mattresses on the floor to provide a safe place for residents who might otherwise fall out of bed.\nAging baby boomers “are going to want to have sex, and they don’t want to play bingo,” Dr. Frankowski said. Yet many nursing homes have no sexual intimacy policy.\n“Most of them are embarrassed by sex,” Dr. Speck said. “Older persons are not considered to be sexual.”\nAn exception is the Hebrew Home, where staff members are asked to assess consent with nonverbal cues, to note a resident’s mood after sex, and to pose questions like: “Do you enjoy sexual contact?,” “Do you know what it means to have sex?,” and “What would you do if you wanted it to stop?”\n“I’ve definitely had family members who have gotten very aggressive opposing our position in encouraging intimacy,” Mr. Reingold said. But staff members will tell family members, “Look, Dad is happy. Why would you want to deprive him of this?”\nIn other facilities, though, Dr. Frankowski said: “I find staff members saying ‘It’s wrong. Old people don’t do this, they had spouses in the past, they have family member that would be concerned.’ ”\n“Sometimes they will say to the resident, ‘Do you really want your daughter to know about this?’ And the staff members do really and truly believe they are doing the right thing.”\nDementia can cause some people to become sexually disinhibited, so facilities like Hebrew Home monitor patients to prevent situations that threaten or make other patients uncomfortable, such as patients masturbating in public rooms.\nExperts say adult children whose parents are in second or third marriages may have more difficulty condoning sexual activity with the newer spouse, something that may have played a role in Iowa, where Mrs. Rayhons’s daughters and husband disagreed about her care.\nDuring opening arguments last Thursday, the prosecutor, Tyler Buller, said, “On May 23 of last year, Donna Rayhons couldn’t make her own decisions.” He also said seminal fluid corresponding to Mr. Rayhons’s DNA was found on sheets, a quilt and Mrs. Rayhons’s panties.\nThe defense lawyer, Joel Yunek, said a rape kit found no semen in Mrs. Rayhons’s vagina or signs of tearing. He said Mr. Rayhons had had sex with his wife at the nursing home, but not on May 23.\nOn Monday, Mr. Yunek asked Dr. Brady if “Donna is happy to see Henry — hugs, smiles, they hold hands, they talk — would that indicate that she is in fact capable at that point of understanding the affection with Henry?” Dr. Brady said no, calling that a “primal response” not indicative of the ability to make informed decisions.\nDr. Alireza Yarahmadi, a neurologist testifying for the prosecution, also disagreed with Mr. Yunek’s contention, saying, “They do have feelings, but they don’t have good judgment.”\nMr. Rayhons may testify this week. His lawyer and his son, Dale, declined to comment, but soon after the arrest, his family issued a statement saying in part: “Accusing a spouse of a crime for continuing a relationship with his spouse in a nursing home seems to us to be incredibly illogical and unnatural, as well as incredibly hurtful.”","[""People with severe Alzheimer's may not remember their family members' names.""]",2409,15,0.02409,0.00045,0.02454
"To his accusers, Maurice R. Greenberg, also known as Hank, is just one in a line of disgraced chief executives from the mid-2000s who resorted to accounting fraud to pad their lavish bonuses. But even they have to admit one thing: The man has stamina.\nMr. Greenberg, who built A.I.G. into a global insurance colossus before being forced to resign in 2005, will turn 90 on Monday. The Council on Foreign Relations is observing the milestone with a dinner in his honor. He’ll also be celebrating at a lunch with his wife, Corinne, his four children, numerous grandchildren and other members of his extended family.\nThe accounting scandal that has shadowed Mr. Greenberg for the last decade also lives on. Mr. Greenberg expects to take the witness stand in July after years of discovery and procedural maneuvers in the civil fraud case originally filed by Eliot Spitzer when he was New York’s attorney general. Mr. Greenberg is also the driving force behind a four-year-old lawsuit claiming the federal government unconstitutionally seized A.I.G.’s assets during the financial crisis. Mr. Greenberg is pursuing $40 billion in damages in that case and, more important, public vindication for the company he spent a career building. Closing arguments were last week and a decision is expected this summer.\nMany younger people have been worn down by the demands and distractions of far less protracted and contentious lawsuits, let alone two at the same time. And surely, few people would choose to spend their golden years surrounded by lawyers, facing subpoenas and hostile cross-examination. Yet, if anything, Mr. Greenberg seems to have been energized.\nIn the 10 years since he resigned from A.I.G. at age 80, Mr. Greenberg and a close circle of longtime colleagues have built the privately held C. V. Starr & Company from a small holding company with a handful of insurance agencies and employees into a global insurance company with over 3,000 employees. He also is a director of the Starr Foundation, which has bestowed over $2.2 billion in grants to New York charities alone. And in his spare time, he co-wrote a book, “The AIG Story,” published in 2013.\nEd Matthews, president of Starr and a close colleague of Mr. Greenberg since they met in 1967, said: “I can’t go so far as to say the lawsuits have invigorated him, but he was unjustly tarred and his reputation was besmirched. He’ll do everything possible to set the record straight.”\nHe’s also willing, and unlike most people, able to spend whatever it takes. His primary lawyer and adviser has been David Boies, the famed litigator and chairman of Boies, Schiller & Flexner. Mr. Boies and his firm represent Mr. Greenberg and Starr in the federal and state lawsuits and is also representing Mr. Greenberg in a defamation suit against Mr. Spitzer. Although Mr. Greenberg has said he lost 90 percent of his personal fortune, estimated by Forbes at $3.2 billion, when the value of A.I.G.’s shares collapsed in the financial crisis, he was granted about $200 million for legal expenses in a settlement with A.I.G.\nCurious about the sources of his age-defying drive, I visited Mr. Greenberg this week at his Park Avenue office at the headquarters of the Starr Companies. Slight of stature, trim and impeccably dressed, Mr. Greenberg is a diet and fitness fanatic who could easily pass for 20 years younger.\n“I have good genes,” Mr. Greenberg said, when I asked his secret. He said his great-grandmother died at 107 and “had all her marbles.” But attributing his preternatural vigor to genes alone seems unduly modest. He mentioned that he played an hour of singles tennis the Sunday before we met and works out at least 45 minutes every day, including intense personal training sessions at Serious Strength, a fitness studio on the Upper West Side. He hikes (in Switzerland, where he and his wife have a house), cycles and was an avid downhill skier until recently. He said he gets six to seven hours of sleep a night, going to bed between 10 and 11 p.m. and rising at 5 a.m.\n“Age doesn’t matter to me,” he said. “No one is invincible, and I might not wake up tomorrow. But I don’t think about that. I’m doing what I want to do, and that’s what’s important.”\nAdded Mr. Matthews, “Nothing is more important than Hank’s place in history.”\nMuch of that history is on display in Mr. Greenberg’s spacious corner office, which is lined with photographs of him with American presidents, cabinet officers and foreign leaders, many of whom Mr. Greenberg has outlived. Mr. Greenberg was especially close to Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger (who will be at his birthday dinner) and had close relations with a succession of Chinese leaders (A.I.G. traces its roots to an insurance company founded by Cornelius Vander Starr in Shanghai in 1919). Mr. Greenberg succeeded Mr. Starr as chief executive in 1967 and took the company public. Before the financial crisis, A.I.G. was the largest insurance company in the world and reached a market capitalization of $242 billion in 2000.\nThat record of decades of nearly unmitigated success came to an abrupt end in early 2005, when Mr. Greenberg, during an earnings call, was asked a question about regulators, and commented they were turning “foot faults into murder charges.” He didn’t mention Mr. Spitzer by name, but the aggressive New York attorney general was embroiled in an investigation of Mr. Greenberg’s son, Jeffrey, who had been the chief executive of Marsh & McLennan until he was forced to resign the year before. Mr. Spitzer fired back that Mr. Greenberg should be “very, very careful” about what he called foot faults and issued a wave of subpoenas to A.I.G. and Mr. Greenberg. Mr. Spitzer publicly threatened to file criminal charges. Under the pressure of the investigation, Mr. Greenberg was forced to resign from A.I.G. in June 2005. (Whether A.I.G. would have come close to collapse in 2008 had Mr. Greenberg been allowed to stay remains an open question. Marsh & McLennan later settled civil fraud charges, but Mr. Greenberg was never charged with any wrongdoing.)\n“I couldn’t believe it,” Mr. Greenberg said of the accounting fraud suit. “Spitzer went on television and accused me of criminal fraud. I was very depressed. I was told I could plead guilty, but to what? I did nothing improper. I would never admit I did something just to get out of litigation.”\nMr. Spitzer told me this week the claim that the lawsuit was retaliation against Mr. Greenberg “is the most ridiculous assertion I’ve ever seen.” He added, “The case is well documented and was brought to our office by established members of the business establishment.”\nStanding on principle may be partly generational. Mr. Greenberg is one of a dwindling number of “the Greatest Generation,” as Tom Brokaw called World War II veterans who grew up during the Depression and fought “because it was the right thing to do.” Mr. Greenberg spent much of his childhood on a small farm in an impoverished area of the Catskills near Liberty, N.Y. His father died when he was 6, and his mother worked as a manicurist. At age 17, he dropped out of high school and lied about his age to enlist in the Army, where he learned “discipline, focus and loyalty,” Mr. Brokaw wrote in his 1998 best seller.\n“We were poor,” Mr. Greenberg said. “We didn’t complain. We did what we had to do to survive. And we knew right from wrong. I’ve always believed that if you do something wrong, you should admit it. But if not, you fight for what you believe in.”\nMr. Spitzer never obtained the threatened indictment for criminal fraud, but the original complaint claimed that Mr. Greenberg and A.I.G. had engaged in elaborate accounting schemes, including sham transactions, to enhance the company’s balance sheet and mislead the investing public. Over the years, the original five causes of action and multiple counts have dwindled to two items. A New York appeals court recently ruled that those counts can go to trial this summer.\nThe state’s case for damages has also shrunk. It now claims that Mr. Greenberg should forfeit his bonuses from the relevant period ($40 million) and be barred for life from serving as an officer or director of a public company.\nAlthough A.I.G. paid $1.64 billion in 2006 to settle the case (and acknowledged improper accounting practices) and Mr. Greenberg himself paid $15 million in 2009 to settle failure to supervise charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission, he hasn’t admitted to any wrongdoing. In a rare public comment on an S.E.C. settlement, he said he had “no responsibility” for any fraud or accounting improprieties at A.I.G.\nThe case is now in the hands of its third New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman. “We look forward to proving at trial that Mr. Greenberg knowingly orchestrated two major frauds that led to his ouster in 2005, which were illegal and caused hundreds of millions — if not billions — in losses to A.I.G.’s shareholders,” said Matt Mittenthal, a spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman\nMr. Greenberg said the longevity of the case and the damage to his reputation have shaken, but by no means destroyed, his faith in the rule of law. “There have been opportunities to settle over the years,” Mr. Boies said. “His view is the case doesn’t have any merit and he’d rather fight than settle. He really believes in the American dream of being able to start with nothing, achieve great success and then give back. He believes it’s fundamentally unfair to target someone just because they’ve been successful.”\nMr. Greenberg insists that his mission is more than just personal vindication. “If you believe the Constitution is being violated and you keep silent, then where is this country headed?” he said. “You have to fight for what’s right.”\nThe Common Sense column on Friday, about the continuing battle of Maurice R. Greenberg, a former chief executive of the American International Group, to defend the company against accusations stemming from the financial crisis, misstated, in some copies, the year he was named its chief. It was 1967, not 1962.","[""People generally need sleep to function.""]",2380,8,0.023799999999999998,0.00024,0.02404
"For the second time in five years, prosecutors have prevailed over Sergey Aleynikov, the former Goldman Sachs programmer accused of stealing confidential computer trading code from the bank. The first time it took a federal jury just hours to convict; this time it came after more than a week of deliberation and an accusation of “food poisoning” and avocado tampering in a state court jury room.\nA jury on Friday convicted Mr. Aleynikov on one count he faced but acquitted him on another and deadlocked on a third. Mr. Aleynikov, who is unlikely to face much if any prison time, cracked a nervous smile after the decision was announced.\nThe split verdict — a striking conclusion to a case that divided the legal world, inspired a best-selling book and spotlighted the secret formulas behind high-frequency trading on Wall Street — came after the case nearly ended in what would have been the most bizarre of mistrials.\nThe possible mistrial stemmed from a dispute between two jurors deciding Mr. Aleynikov’s fate; a female juror accused a male one of “food tampering,” in part because an avocado was missing from her sandwich. The female juror also said she took a blood test to determine whether she had been poisoned, temporarily turning the criminal proceedings into a culinary whodunit.\nBut the judge overseeing the case, Justice Daniel P. Conviser of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, called her accusations “completely unfounded.” And after he dismissed the feuding jurors — and Mr. Aleynikov’s lawyer, Kevin Marino, dropped his request for a mistrial — both sides agreed to continue with a 10-member jury.\nTheir verdict, a partial victory for the Manhattan district attorney’s office in one of its most prominent financial cases in recent memory, raised questions about Mr. Aleynikov’s decision to roll the dice with the smaller jury. He could have objected to the remaining jurors, which would have either prompted a mistrial or laid the groundwork for an appeal. According to people close to the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Mr. Marino and even some prosecutors suspected that the 10 jurors were prepared to acquit.\nIn an interview with reporters on Friday, Mr. Marino explained that “we took the longer view,” avoiding yet another trial and hoping that the jury would acquit, noting that it did on one count.\nIn any other case, a conviction after near mistrial by food fight might seem like a plot twist that only Hollywood could dream up. But in the on-again-off-again legal odyssey that is the People v. Aleynikov, it was merely the latest in a long line of peculiar episodes.\nMr. Aleynikov, a 45-year-old former Goldman software programmer who was born in Russia and is now also a citizen of the United States, was first arrested on July 3, 2009. His first conviction was overturned in 2012 by an appeals court, which ruled that federal prosecutors in the case had misapplied the corporate espionage laws against him.\nBut Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, took up the case anew and eventually charged Mr. Aleynikov under state laws, drawing an outcry from defense lawyers, who complained about prosecutorial overkill. Then, a state judge tossed out much of the prosecution’s evidence, ruling that the F.B.I. had conducted an “illegal arrest” of Mr. Aleynikov.\nMr. Aleynikov, who lost his job and marriage in the fallout from the case, has become something of a cause célèbre in legal and media circles. Michael Lewis wrote a sympathetic profile of Mr. Aleynikov in Vanity Fair and later adapted the article into the best-selling book “Flash Boys” about high-frequency trading.\nFor Mr. Aleynikov, who rejected a plea deal that would have spared him prison time, the verdict is a blow but not a dead end.\nJustice Conviser has expressed some skepticism about the case and left open the possibility that he might throw out the conviction, a rare step that takes place when a judge concludes that a verdict is legally invalid. His decision is expected in about five weeks.\nAnd even if the conviction stands, Justice Conviser signaled on Friday that he was unlikely to send Mr. Aleynikov to prison, telling prosecutors that he was lifting Mr. Aleynikov’s $35,000 bail. Mr. Marino is likely to emphasize that Mr. Aleynikov already served a year in federal prison before the appeals court vacated his conviction.\nThe thrust of the case against Mr. Aleynikov, a bespectacled computer whiz who cuts a gaunt figure in the shadow of Mr. Marino’s football-player build, did not change from federal to state court. In the state case, Mr. Aleynikov was indicted on two counts of unlawful use of secret scientific material and one count of unlawful duplication of computer-related material.\nAuthorities focused on Mr. Aleynikov’s decision to download proprietary Goldman source code before leaving the bank for a high-frequency trading firm in Chicago. To cover his tracks, Mr. Aleynikov tried to delete the history of commands on his Goldman computer.\nMr. Marino did not challenge the underlying facts. Instead, he said they added up to a simple breach of Goldman’s confidentiality policy.\n“There’s no doubt Mr. Aleynikov did something wrong,” he told the jury, stopping occasionally to sip from a water bottle he clutched throughout his closing statement. “But this is a very badly misguided case.”\nA skilled orator with a booming voice and a knack for hyperbole, Mr. Marino once shouted in open court that the case against Mr. Aleynikov was “a wild thing,” saying that prosecutors failed to establish the basic elements of the crimes they charged.\nThat argument appeared to resonate with at least some of the jurors. At times during the deliberations, which began on April 22, the jurors seemed baffled by the charge of unlawful use of secret scientific material, a decades-old criminal statute that predates the digital age. The panel sent more than a dozen notes to Justice Conviser seeking clarity on the meaning of the law.\nMr. Marino said the jury’s decision to convict Mr. Aleynikov on one count of violating that law, and then deadlock on another count involving the same law, illustrated the jurors’ confusion. They found Mr. Aleynikov not guilty of the unlawful-duplication charge.\nMr. Marino argued during the trial that Mr. Aleynikov did not acquire a “major portion” of the economic value of the code, an element that the prosecution needed to prove. Mr. Marino also emphasized that Mr. Aleynikov did not make a “tangible” reproduction of the files, another requirement for proving unlawful use of secret scientific material.\n“Can you taste it?” Mr. Marino asked an F.B.I. agent who arrested Mr. Aleynikov. “I don’t think so,” the agent replied.\nOver the course of the trial, Mr. Marino and his client benefited from some favorable judicial rulings.\nAt the onset, Justice Conviser refused the prosecution’s request to delay the start for several weeks. Weeks later, the judge ruled that prosecutors could not call an expert witness because they had failed to provide Mr. Marino adequate time to prepare.\nDaniel Holmes, a Manhattan assistant district attorney, made up some of that lost ground with a compelling closing argument. In the nearly 90-minute address, delivered to a courtroom packed with spectators, Mr. Holmes implored the jurors to use their “common sense.”\nDespite the long deliberations, signs of juror tension did not emerge until this week. And even now, the exact nature of the avocado dispute remains a mystery.\nOn Monday, when the avocado dispute occurred, the jurors ordered lunch from Mon Cher market, which charges a dollar extra for avocado on sandwiches. Later in the week, jurors were on their own for lunch. But by Thursday, they were back to ordering from Mon Cher.\nAn earlier version of a photo caption with this article misstated the surname of Sergey Aleynikov’s lawyer. He is Kevin Marino, not Marion.","[""Stealing confidential computer trading code from a bank is illegal.""]",1830,13,0.0183,0.00039,0.018690000000000002
"The toxic vapors acted quickly against the Second Platoon of the 811th Ordnance Company, whose soldiers were moving abandoned barrels out of an Iraqi Republican Guard warehouse in 2003. The building, one soldier said, was littered with dead birds.\nAs the soldiers pushed the barrels over and began rolling them, some of the contents leaked, they said, filling the air with a bitter, penetrating smell. Soon, many were dizzy and suffering from running noses and tearing eyes. A few were vomiting, disoriented, tingling or numb.\nAfter the soldiers staggered outside for air, multiple detection tests indicated the presence of nerve agent. Others suggested blister agent, too. The results seemed to confirm the victims’ fear that they had stumbled upon unused stocks of Iraq’s chemical weapons.\nFrom Camp Taji, where the barrels had been found, more than 20 exposed soldiers were evacuated in helicopters to a military hospital in Balad, where they were met by soldiers wearing gas masks and ordered to undress before being allowed inside for medical care.\n“They drew a box in the sand and had armed guards and were like: ‘Do not get out of that box. Do not get out of that box,’ ” said Nathan Willie, a private first class at the time. “I was kind of freaked out.”\nSince last fall, the United States military has acknowledged that American soldiers found thousands of abandoned chemical weapons in Iraq, and that hundreds of troops notified the military medical system that they believed they had been exposed to them. The military acknowledged the exposures after years of secrecy — and of denying medical tracking and official recognition to victims — only after an investigation by The New York Times.\nEven then, the affliction of the 811th Ordnance Company had quietly remained one of the unsolved mysteries of the Iraq war, and a parable of what several of the victims describe as the corrosive effects of the government’s secrecy on troop welfare and public trust.\nSince the episode, several of the sickened soldiers have complained of health effects that they say may be linked to handling leaking barrels. But instead of finding the Army concerned or committed to their well-being, they faced years of shifting stories about what exactly had made them ill.\nThe Army, they said, at first suggested that they might have been exposed to the nerve agent sarin. Then it said that chemical warfare field detection tests were unreliable and that the liquid was most likely a pesticide or something else. Then it dropped the subject entirely.\nStill, several of the victims suffered. But because the military’s records relating to the episode were classified, the victims said, they lacked the information to settle their gnawing worries or to give them the standing necessary to pursue medical care or disability claims.\nThomas S. Blanton, director of the National Security Archive, which advocates open government, said the government’s refusal to share its information was a case of the habits of secrecy trumping common sense.\n“Soldiers exposed to something really dangerous cannot find out what it was because ‘Sorry it’s classified’?” he said. “It’s creepy and it’s crazy.”\n“The outrage here,” he added, “is extraordinary.”\nNonetheless, the efforts to ferret out the truth, the victims said, repeatedly met with official indifference, stalled public-records requests and medical care providers who turned them away — belying the Army’s slogan that its soldiers come first.\n“We were expendable at all costs,” said Kareem Sinclair, who was a specialist in 2003 but is now out of the Army. “It was just fallen by the wayside, kind of like the Vietnam vets with Agent Orange.”\nMr. Sinclair, who complains of headaches and short-term memory loss, said he also wondered whether a cancer of his diagnosed in 2004 was related to the contents of the barrels.\nEarlier this year, the Pentagon adopted guidelines for screening hundreds of veterans who were exposed to chemical weapons in Iraq.\nAmong those to be offered medical examinations are roughly two dozen soldiers from the 811th Ordnance Company and others who worked with or treated them after their exposure in 2003, according to Brad R. Carson, an acting under secretary of defense, who led the Pentagon’s review of chemical casualties.\nAnd last week, after repeated requests by The Times, the Army declassified a two-page document that appears to answer the veterans’ first question: What was in the barrels?\nThe document, a site survey report written after liquid samples were tested by the Iraq Survey Group, the task force organized by the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency to examine Iraq’s special weapons programs, identified the contents as benzenamine 3,4 dimethyl, an organic compound with multiple industrial uses.\nIn boldface letters, the report called the compound “a carcinogen and poisonous chemical.”\nChemists and chemical warfare specialists interviewed said the chemical was part of a family of organic compounds used in a binary rocket fuel for Eastern bloc missiles and rockets, including variants of the Scud.\nThe fuel, sometimes called TG-02 or Tonka fuel, is known to cause acute exposure symptoms that partly mirror those for nerve agents, including intense headaches, confusion, weakness, depression of the central nervous system and death.\nWhen asked why the Army had not shared its information for more than a decade, Mr. Carson said he was at a loss, beyond the fact that the Iraq Survey Group was not in the Army’s chain of command, which may have limited the information flow.\n“All I can do is level with them now,” Mr. Carson said of the veterans.\nOne of them, former Sgt. First Class Dennis Marcello, had been fighting for the records since 2009, when he first filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the documents related to the soldiers’ exposure. He expressed gratitude at the belated release, but also anger and a sense of vindication after having been what he called “slow-rolled” for years.\n“The government knew beyond doubt that it was toxic and failed to inform and properly treat the troops, and kept that information from them for a decade-plus,” Mr. Marcello said. “There is no denying this now.”\nFor many of the victims, the government’s long reluctance to share its records has been one part of an operation mishandled from the outset.\nAfter the defeat of Iraq, as American forces began the long occupation of the country, the 811th Ordnance Company, a reserve unit with soldiers from West Virginia and Virginia, was assigned to secure stockpiles of abandoned Iraqi ordnance.\nLt. Col. Timothy Cary, who commanded the company as a captain in 2003, said his soldiers were ordered to sort and store as much as 50 convoys of captured ammunition each day — a task for which they were neither equipped nor prepared.\n“The way they formed this task force to deal with this stuff was uncalled-for,” he said.\nOn May 13, 2003, the company was assigned to clear a warehouse formerly used by the Republican Guard’s rocket and missile corps. Inside were about two dozen barrels.\nThe soldiers were not provided a translator to help them read the labels or any warnings on the building’s doors and walls. They were not carrying gas masks.\nAs the work began, Pfc. Jessica Snyder felt a flash of concern. “When we went in, before we started rolling stuff out, there were dead birds lying around,” she said.\nWhile the soldiers were moving the barrels, a strong pungent odor rose. Mr. Sinclair said the smell was slightly sweet, and its effects were swift.\n“As soon as it made contact with my mouth and nose, my eyes started to water and my nose started running and then I started throwing up,” he said.\n“It happened really fast, and it was like a chain reaction” as others fell ill, he said.\nThe company’s young officers quickly arranged for the soldiers to be moved to a clinic, where their arrival “set off an alarm on the whole base,” said Maj. Marcus Clonch, who was a first lieutenant and the company’s executive officer at the time.\nAfter the soldiers were flown to Balad, they were admitted to the hospital for stays of up to a few days, before returning to duty at Taji.\nField detection tests indicated the presence of nerve agent at the warehouses, though the victims and chemical warfare specialists alike noted that the field tests are prone to false positives, and are not considered conclusive.\nIn the climate of uncertainty, several of the victims said, they were ordered not to discuss their exposure, and the Army did little to answer questions about what had occurred.\n“They told us we weren’t supposed to talk to reporters or anyone when we came back,” said Ray Sirbaugh, a specialist at the time who is now medically retired from other wounds. He said he had suffered headaches and memory loss since inhaling the vapors.\nMr. Willie confirmed Mr. Sirbaugh’s account. “I remember Ray and Sinclair, they were older than us, and they wanted to get some answers, and they came back and said they were told not to talk about it,” Mr. Willie said. “It was a big morale killer.”\nMs. Snyder, who was honorably discharged from the Army in 2010 as a sergeant, said the Army never discussed any risks associated with the exposure.\n“I heard it was pesticide, I heard it was full-blown nerve agent,” she said. “They didn’t give us enough information about it, and it would have been nice to have been tested over the years in case something is wrong.”\nSeveral soldiers said one young officer acting on his own — Lieutenant Clonch, now a major — created an unclassified record that eventually allowed the veterans to confront the Army.\nThe record, a memo summarizing what happened at the warehouse, did not declare what the soldiers had inhaled; Major Clonch said in an interview that he was never able to find out. But he made a point of sharing his memo, which noted the positive field test results for nerve agent, with the rank and file.\n“The account I did was for everybody’s medical record,” he said. “That was really the only record we were given.”\nThe record did not spur the Army to disclose what it knew, or to examine the victims for long-term health problems. Several victims said it did not even make its way into their records. But they retained personal copies, which ultimately provided a means for one of the exposed veterans, Mr. Marcello, to try years later to have the episode recognized.\nMr. Marcello said he used photographs from the warehouse and the lieutenant’s memo as part of the public-records request he first filed in 2009, seeking to force the Army to reveal the details.\nMr. Carson, after reviewing Mr. Marcello’s long-idle records requests at the request of The Times, approved the release of the two-page report last week. Mr. Marcello received a copy of the record Tuesday afternoon.\nBut the Army has still not released many other records he sought, or provided answers to his lingering questions, including what ultimately happened to the barrels.\nThe Iraq Survey Group did not extract liquid samples from the barrels until August 2003, roughly three months after the soldiers were exposed. Later, Mr. Marcello said, he returned to the warehouse to check on the barrels. They were gone.\n“Where did those barrels finally go?” he asked. “Who took them? How were they disposed of? You ask yourself these questions, year after year, and you wonder: Why is all of this some kind of secret operation?”","[""Dead birds can be a sign of a toxic environment.""]",2524,12,0.025240000000000002,0.00035999999999999997,0.0256
"John F. Nash Jr., a mathematician who shared a Nobel Prize in 1994 for work that greatly extended the reach and power of modern economic theory and whose decades-long descent into severe mental illness and eventual recovery were the subject of a book and a 2001 film, both titled “A Beautiful Mind,” was killed, along with his wife, in a car crash on Saturday in New Jersey. He was 86.\nDr. Nash and his wife, Alicia, 82, were in a taxi on the New Jersey Turnpike in Monroe Township around 4:30 p.m. when the driver lost control while trying to pass another car and hit a guard rail and another vehicle, said Sgt. Gregory Williams of the New Jersey State Police.\nThe couple were ejected from the cab and pronounced dead at the scene. The State Police said it was likely that they were not wearing seat belts. The taxi driver and the driver of the other car were treated for non-life threatening injuries. No criminal charges have been filed.\nThe Nashes were returning from Norway, where Dr. Nash and Louis Nirenberg, a mathematician from New York University, had received the Abel Prize from The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.\nDr. Nash was widely regarded as one of the great mathematicians of the 20th century, known for the originality of his thinking and for his fearlessness in wrestling down problems so difficult few others dared tackle them. A one-sentence letter written in support of his application to Princeton’s doctoral program in math said simply, “This man is a genius.”\n“John’s remarkable achievements inspired generations of mathematicians, economists and scientists,’’ the president of Princeton, Christopher L. Eisgruber, said on Sunday, “and the story of his life with Alicia moved millions of readers and moviegoers who marveled at their courage in the face of daunting challenges.”\nRussell Crowe, who portrayed Dr. Nash in “A Beautiful Mind,” tweeted that he was “stunned,” by his death. “An amazing partnership,” he wrote. “Beautiful minds, beautiful hearts.”\nDr. Nash’s theory of noncooperative games, published in 1950 and known as Nash equilibrium, provided a conceptually simple but powerful mathematical tool for analyzing a wide range of competitive situations, from corporate rivalries to legislative decision making. Dr. Nash’s approach is now pervasive in economics and throughout the social sciences and is applied routinely in other fields, like evolutionary biology.\nHarold W. Kuhn, an emeritus professor of mathematics at Princeton and a longtime friend and colleague of Dr. Nash’s who died in 2014, said, “I think honestly that there have been really not that many great ideas in the 20th century in economics and maybe, among the top 10, his equilibrium would be among them.” A University of Chicago economist, Roger Myerson, went further, comparing the impact of Nash equilibrium on economics “to that of the discovery of the DNA double helix in the biological sciences.”\nDr. Nash also made contributions to pure mathematics that many mathematicians view as more significant than his Nobel-winning work on game theory, including solving an intractable problem in differential geometry derived from the work of the 19th century mathematician G.F.B. Riemann.\nHis achievements were the more remarkable, colleagues said, for being contained in a handful of papers published before he was 30.\n“Jane Austen wrote six novels,’’ said Barry Mazur, a professor of mathematics at Harvard who was a freshman at M.I.T. when Dr. Nash taught there. “I think Nash’s pure mathematical contributions are on that level. Very, very few papers he wrote on different subjects, but the ones that had impact had incredible impact.”\nYet to a wider audience, Dr. Nash was probably best known for his life story, a tale of dazzling achievement, devastating loss and almost miraculous redemption. The narrative of Dr. Nash’s brilliant rise, the lost years when his world dissolved in schizophrenia, his return to rationality and the awarding of the Nobel, retold in a biography by Sylvia Nasar and in the Oscar-winning film, starring Mr. Crowe and Jennifer Connelly as John and Alicia Nash, captured the public mind and became a symbol of the destructive force of mental illness and the stigma that often hounds those who suffer from it.\nJohn Forbes Nash was born on June 13, 1928, in Bluefield, W. Va. His father, John Sr., was an electrical engineer. His mother, Margaret, was a schoolteacher.\nAs a child, John Nash may have been a prodigy but he was not a sterling student, Ms. Nasar noted in a 1994 article in The New York Times. “He read constantly. He played chess. He whistled entire Bach melodies,” she wrote.\nIn high school, he stumbled across E.T. Bell’s book, “Men of Mathematics,” and soon demonstrated his own mathematical skill by independently proving a classic Fermat theorem, an accomplishment he recalled in an autobiographical essay written for the Nobel committee.\nIntending to become an engineer like his father, he entered Carnegie Mellon (then called Carnegie Institute of Technology). But he chafed at the regimented courses, and encouraged by professors who recognized his mathematical genius, he switched to mathematics.\nReceiving his bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Carnegie, he arrived at Princeton in 1948, a time of great expectations, when American children still dreamed of growing up to be physicists like Einstein or mathematicians like the brilliant, Hungarian-born polymath John von Neumann, both of whom attended the afternoon teas at Fine Hall, the home of the math department.\nJohn Nash, tall and good-looking, quickly became known for his intellectual arrogance, his odd habits — he paced the halls, walked off in the middle of conversations, whistled incessantly — and his fierce ambition, his colleagues have recalled.\nHe invented a game, known as Nash, that became an obsession in the Fine Hall common room. (The same game, invented independently in Denmark, was later sold by Parker Brothers as Hex.) He also took on a problem left unsolved by Dr. von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, the pioneers of game theory, in their now classic book, “Theory of Games and Economic Behavior.”\nDr. von Neumann and Dr. Morgenstern, an economist at Princeton, addressed only so-called zero-sum games, in which one player’s gain is another’s loss. But most real world interactions are more complicated, where players’ interests are not directly opposed, and there are opportunities for mutual gain. Dr. Nash’s solution, contained in a 27-page doctoral thesis he wrote when he was 21, provided a way of analyzing how each player could maximize his benefits, assuming that the other players would also act to maximize their self-interest.\nThis deceptively simple extension of game theory paved the way for economic theory to be applied to a wide variety of other situations besides the marketplace.\n“It was a very natural discovery,” Dr. Kuhn said. “A variety of people would have come to the same results at the same time, but John did it and he did it on his own.”\nAfter receiving his doctorate at Princeton, Dr. Nash served as a consultant for the RAND Corporation and as an instructor at M.I.T. and still had a penchant for attacking problems that no one else could solve. On a dare, he developed an entirely original approach to a longstanding problem in differential geometry, showing that abstract geometric spaces called Riemannian manifolds could be squished into arbitrarily small pieces of Euclidean space.\nAs his career flourished and his reputation grew, however, Dr. Nash’s personal life became increasingly complex. A turbulent romance with a nurse in Boston, Eleanor Stier, resulted in the birth of a son, John David Stier, in 1953. Dr. Nash also had a series of relationships with men, and while at RAND in the summer of 1954, he was arrested in a men’s bathroom for indecent exposure, according to Ms. Nasar’s biography. And doubts about his accomplishments gnawed at him: two of mathematics’ highest honors, the Putnam Competition and the Fields medal, had eluded him.\nIn 1957, after two years of on-and-off courtship, he married Alicia Larde, an M.I.T. physics major from an aristocratic Central American family and one of only 16 women in the class of 1955.\n“He was very, very good looking, very intelligent,” Mrs. Nash told Ms. Nasar. “It was a little bit of a hero worship thing.”\nBut early in 1959, with Alicia pregnant with their son, John, Dr. Nash began to unravel. His brilliance turned malignant, leading him into a landscape of paranoia and delusion, and in April, he was hospitalized at McLean Hospital, outside Boston, sharing the psychiatric ward with, among others, the poet Robert Lowell.\nIt was the first step of a steep decline. There were more hospitalizations. He underwent electroshock therapy and fled for a while to Europe, sending cryptic postcards to colleagues and family members. For many years he roamed the Princeton campus, a lonely figure scribbling unintelligible formulas on the same blackboards in Fine Hall where he had once demonstrated startling mathematical feats.\nThough game theory was gaining in prominence, and his work cited ever more frequently and taught widely in economics courses around the world, Dr. Nash had vanished from the professional world.\n“He hadn’t published a scientific paper since 1958,” Ms. Nasar wrote in the 1994 Times article. “He hadn’t held an academic post since 1959. Many people had heard, incorrectly, that he had had a lobotomy. Others, mainly those outside of Princeton, simply assumed that he was dead.”\nIndeed, Dr. Myerson recalled in a telephone interview that one scholar who wrote to Dr. Nash in the 1980s to ask permission to reprint an article received the letter back with one sentence scrawled across it: “You may use my article as if I were dead.”\nStill, Dr. Nash was fortunate in having family members, colleagues and friends, in Princeton and elsewhere, who protected him, got him work, and in general helped him survive. Alicia Nash divorced him in 1963, but continued to stand by him, taking him into her house to live in 1970. (The couple married a second time in 2001.)\nMrs. Nash supported her ex-husband and her son by working as a computer programmer, with some financial help from family, friends and colleagues\nBy the early 1990s, when the Nobel committee began investigating the possibility of awarding Dr. Nash its memorial prize in economics, his illness had quieted. He later said that he simply decided that he was going to return to rationality. “I emerged from irrational thinking, ultimately, without medicine other than the natural hormonal changes of aging,” he wrote in an email to Dr. Kuhn in 1996.\nColleagues, including Dr. Kuhn, helped persuade the Nobel committee that Dr. Nash was well enough to accept the prize — he shared it with two economists, John C. Harsanyi of the University of California at Berkeley, and Reinhard Selten of the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms University in Bonn, Germany — and they defended him when some questioned giving the prize to a man who had suffered from a serious mental disorder.\nThe Nobel, the publicity that attended it, and the making of the film were “a watershed in his life,” Dr. Kuhn said of Dr. Nash. “It changed him from a homeless unknown person who was wandering around Princeton to a celebrity, and financially, it put him on a much better basis.”\nDr. Nash is survived by two sons, John David Stier and John Charles Martin Nash, and a sister, Martha Nash Legg.\nDr. Nash continued to work, traveling and speaking at conferences and attempting, among other things, to formulate a new theory of cooperative games. Friends described him as charming and diffident, a bit socially awkward, a little quiet, with scant trace of the arrogance of his youth.\n“You don’t find many mathematicians approaching things this way now, bare-handedly attacking a problem,” the way Dr. Nash did, said Dr. Mazur.\nAn earlier version of this obituary misstated the title of a book by E.T. Bell. It is “Men of Mathematics,” not “Men and Mathematics.” It also misstated the poet with whom Dr. Nash spent time in the psychiatric ward at McLean Hospital. It was Robert Lowell, not Ezra Pound.","[""Wearing seat belts can prevent occupants from being ejected in a car crash.""]",2776,16,0.02776,0.00048,0.02824
"Now that Sepp Blatter has won his fifth term as president of FIFA, defying all common sense that the leader of a corrupt sport should be ousted instead of rewarded, he can move on to the next big event on his calendar: the Women’s World Cup.\nThat tournament begins on Saturday in Canada, and Blatter will surely use it to try to shine through his most recent tarnish while the women do all the work.\nWhat else would you expect from a man who recently declared himself to be “the godfather” of FIFA women’s soccer?\nThe thing is, painful as it is to admit, there is some truth to Blatter’s hyperbole.\nLike him or not, and most do not, he has shepherded the women’s game to a place it might never have reached without him.\nNew investments. New tournaments. New opportunities. In his 17 years as FIFA president, Blatter has overseen an explosion of growth in the women’s game. On his watch, the Women’s World Cup has expanded from 12 teams to 16 teams to 24 this year.\nThough it took him decades, he did finally bring women onto FIFA’s governing executive committee for the first time, telling the men’s club he leads, again and again, that “the future of the sport lies with women.”\nSure, the sport is still dominated by traditional powers like the United States, France, Germany and Brazil, and by early adopters like Sweden and Norway.\nBut this year’s tournament will include eight debutante nations, including Spain, the Netherlands, Thailand and Ivory Coast. That’s a third of the field. It would be hard to argue to those squads that some portion of the much-maligned FIFA development money — funds that people routinely accuse Blatter of passing out as bribes — had not been used to develop women’s teams where they never existed before.\nBlatter is an imperfect and often reviled hero in this story. His list of cringeworthy sexist remarks is as long as the list of corruption scandals that have dotted and stained his presidency. In one of his creepier comments, he suggested that women’s players market themselves better by wearing tighter shorts because “female players are pretty.”\nAnd in recent years, he has twice been unable to identify a candidate for FIFA women’s player of the year — the Brazilian star Marta and United States striker Alex Morgan — at the very ceremony where the award was presented.\nEven on Friday, as Blatter basked in his re-election as FIFA president, he made a blundering case for more women in the organization’s leadership by clumsily shouting into a microphone, “We need ladies!” And once again, if you could just find a way to ignore the messenger and the fumbled delivery, you’d have to admit the sentiment was right.\nBlatter did not invent women’s soccer, of course. FIFA had crowned two champions before his first election as FIFA president in 1998, and it surely would have thrived in the United States and other countries without him. But there are many places where it needed — where it still needs — a helping hand, and for years Blatter has been the one providing it.\nSo try to ignore his motives, or his ham-handed comments, and focus for a moment on his results, though the overall thought of him might make your stomach turn, with good cause.\nIn 2007, when Germany walloped Argentina, 11-0, in the opening game of that year’s Women’s World Cup, Blatter didn’t say he regretted building the field. He said he wanted to make the event even bigger.\nExpand it to 24 teams, Blatter said. And so FIFA did.\nBlatter also oversaw the introduction of women’s youth World Cups, and women all over the world have enjoyed the benefits. A world championship for players under 20 began in 2002, and another for under-17s was inaugurated in 2008.\nNeither of those events existed when Shannon Boxx, 37 and a midfielder for the United States team, was coming up as a player, but she acknowledged that both had helped raise the top level of the women’s game.\n“You see how those U-17 and U-20 World Cups have helped these young girls who come to our team and are ready to play in big events, because they’ve already been there and they understand the pressure,” Boxx said. “So much has changed in the women’s game. So much has improved over the years.”\nStill, it’s understandably hard for top players to heap even grudging praise on a benefactor with such a checkered reputation.\n“You can’t look at it and say that he’s done nothing for women’s sports,” United States midfielder Megan Rapinoe said. “But I don’t think you should be congratulated or patted on the back for doing the right thing. He has said he is the godfather of the sport, but I think he just sort of allowed it to grow, and it was going to do its own thing anyway.”\nSo, yes, Blatter has been good for women’s soccer. But he has not been afraid to keep the women’s game under his thumb, either. That’s the motive of a godfather, but not the type he thinks he is.\nNo equal prize money for men and women at World Cups. No equal facilities, either. At the World Cup in Canada, the matches will be held on artificial turf instead of grass, the only surface provided — or deemed acceptable — when the championship involves top men’s teams. Many top women’s players sued FIFA and the Canadian Soccer Association last year for gender discrimination, arguing (correctly) that fake grass was an inferior substitute for the real stuff.\nIn response to the women’s complaints, the godfather of women’s soccer didn’t concede or offer the money or the will to fix the situation. He didn’t even do a thing to acknowledge the problem, and the players — sensing imminent defeat and eager to just get on with the games — dropped their lawsuit.\nBut they did not forget the slight.\n“He could have stepped in at any time and said, ‘No, it’s going to be on grass,’ and for very little amount of money, made it happen on grass,” Rapinoe said. “It probably could have happened for less than his private jet bill is every year. It was very doable, and that’s disappointing.”\nJust as Blatter’s fifth term as president is disappointing. For another four years, he will be in charge — the self-proclaimed “president of everybody” — and continue to take credit for the good things and to deflect blame for the bad things.\nAll while the women he says he has championed roll their eyes.","[""The future of the sport lies with women.""]",1525,10,0.01525,0.0003,0.01555
"WASHINGTON — J. Dennis Hastert, the longest-serving Republican House speaker in history, was swept from leadership in 2006 on a wave of Republican revulsion over what critics saw as a legislative favor factory he presided over in Congress. That wave deposited him on K Street, a prime address for the capital’s lobbyists, where his influence and good name kept the favors flowing — including into his bank accounts.\nFederal law enforcement agents say Mr. Hastert’s years as a lobbyist and rainmaker explain how he was able to promise $3.5 million in cash to a former student who claims Mr. Hastert sexually molested him decades ago.\nA former wrestling coach and high school teacher, Mr. Hastert did not enter Congress as wealthy as some of his colleagues. Yet he was still able to amass a small fortune with land deals, one aided by an earmark he secured for a highway interchange.\nBut it was at his own post-Congress lobbying firm and at the professional services firm Dickstein Shapiro that Mr. Hastert swelled his cash flow, working all sides of issues and glad-handing members of Congress for controversial clients.\nThat he stands accused of child molestation is almost universally a shock in Washington — “a gut blow,” said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma and a longtime friend of Mr. Hastert’s. That he had the money, however, is not so startling in the gilded era of Washington lobbying.\n“I’m not surprised he was very successful,” Mr. Cole said. “People less significant in Congress than Speaker Hastert have done exceptionally well afterwards.”\nFrom 2011 to 2014, Lorillard Tobacco paid Dickstein Shapiro nearly $8 million to lobby for the benefit of candy-flavored tobacco and electronic cigarettes, and Mr. Hastert was the most prominent member of the lobbying team.\nHe pressed lawmakers on climate change for Peabody Energy, the largest private-sector coal company in the world, in 2013 and 2014, then switched sides this year and pushed for requiring renewable fuel production for Fuels America. LightSquared, once an ambitious wireless venture, paid his firm $200,000 in the second half of 2011 to watch legislation in Congress on global positioning satellites. Months later, the company fell into bankruptcy after regulators decided its technology would interfere with GPS.\nThe Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group, labeled Mr. Hastert “the eclectic lobbyist.”\nSome former lawmakers “choose lobbying positions that allow them to focus on certain policy areas, like energy,” the group said after Mr. Hastert’s indictment on charges of bank fraud and lying to the F.B.I. “A look at the clients that used the firm and his services for multiple years from 2009 to 2015 indicates no particular area of specialty.”\nThere is one common thread: an emphasis on his specialty in Congress, appropriations bills.\nFor CenterPoint Properties, a large Illinois developer, his team worked on placing a major transportation facility for the Army Reserve. For FirstLine Transportation Security, which screens security guards, he pressed for congressional review of procurement at the Transportation Security Administration, one of the firm’s biggest partners. For the American College of Rheumatology, his focus was the annual labor and health spending bill.\nThe Hastert era in the House may be remembered for rancorous debates on the war in Iraq, passage of a prescription drug benefit for Medicare and approval of President George W. Bush’s tax cuts. But for many Republicans, it was known for loose reins on spending and the extensive use of earmarks, legislation that directed tax dollars to home-district projects.\nMr. Hastert resigned his speakership after the Democratic landslide in 2006 cost Republicans control of the House and Senate, largely as a result of anti-Bush fervor over the Iraq war. But his legacy was largely swept under the Republican rug amid the widespread belief in conservative circles that Mr. Hastert’s tenure had been marred by big spending.\n“There was this pent-up demand for public works, and they kind of went crazy,” said Bruce Bartlett, a former Treasury official whose book, “Impostor,” accused Mr. Bush of profligacy.\nMr. Hastert “was a hands-off guy,” he said. “He was picked because he didn’t do anything” as speaker to control Mr. Bush’s spending.\nThe military spending bill for the 2000 fiscal year contained 997 earmarks. By 2005, that number had grown to 2,506. In 2000, the largest domestic spending bill, which funded labor, health and education programs, had 491 pet projects. By 2005, it had 3,014.\nSteve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, recalled 2005 as the “perfect storm” of the profligate era, with 15,000 earmarks in appropriations bills; the “Bridge to Nowhere” in Alaska, which became a symbol of the need for changes to the system; the conviction of Representative Randy Cunningham on corruption charges for his selling of earmarks; and the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal.\nOne of those earmarks was Mr. Hastert’s. The speaker secured $207 million in the highway law for construction of the proposed Prairie Parkway near 727 acres of farmland in Kendall County, Ill. The Hasterts, through an obscure land trust, owned 69 acres of that tract and a quarter share of 69 other acres. Four months after Mr. Bush signed the earmark into law, the trust sold the land for $4.9 million to a developer eyeing a 1,600-home project off the new highway. Mr. Hastert netted millions, the watchdog Sunlight Foundation discovered.\nLawmakers and fellow lobbyists compared Mr. Hastert’s qualities as a lobbyist to those he displayed as speaker: affable and low key, but attractive to clients. In the post-earmark world, said Mr. Cole, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, Mr. Hastert pressed for policy “riders” in appropriations bills and programmatic changes that broadly helped his clients’ sectors.\n“As you’d expect, he was very effective,” Mr. Cole said. “Number one, he knew the process extremely well, and he knew all the players. When the former speaker calls, no member rejects it.”\nWith a salary of probably $1 million, compensation for serving on boards of directors, speaker’s fees and a book deal, the money was there to pay in cash what law enforcement officials say Mr. Hastert paid, said former Representative Jack Kingston, a Republican who led the Appropriations Committee.\n“Yeah, it’s possible he could amass in a 10-year period a nest egg of $5 to $10 million,” he said. “I’m not saying it’s easy, but it’s not that hard.”","[""Former lawmakers often become lobbyists after leaving office.""]",1539,10,0.01539,0.0003,0.01569
"Democrats allied with Hillary Rodham Clinton are mounting a nationwide legal battle 17 months before the 2016 presidential election, seeking to roll back Republican-enacted restrictions on voter access that Democrats say could, if unchallenged, prove decisive in a close campaign.\nThe Democrats began last month with lawsuits filed in Ohio and Wisconsin, presidential battleground states whose governors are likely to run for the Republican nomination themselves. Now, they are most likely going to attack a host of measures. They include voter identification requirements that Democrats consider onerous, time restrictions imposed on early voting that they say could make it difficult to cast ballots the weekend before Election Day, and rules that could nullify ballots cast in the wrong precinct.\nThe effort, which is being spearheaded by a lawyer whose clients include Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, reflects an urgent practical need, Democrats say: to get litigation underway early enough so that federal judges can be persuaded to intervene in states where Republicans control legislatures and governor’s offices.\nA similar lawsuit was begun last year in North Carolina. Other potential fronts in the pre-emptive legal offensive, Democrats say, could soon be opened in Georgia, Nevada and the increasingly critical presidential proving ground of Virginia.\nAlmost all of those states have growing African-American or Hispanic populations, groups crucial to Mr. Obama in 2012 but whose voting rights Democrats say could be impinged next year, damaging the party’s prospects.\nDemocrats seeking office at every level in 2016 could gain if lawsuits in their states are successful. But Mrs. Clinton, who has a wide lead in public polls, is certain to benefit if she is the party’s nominee.\nOn Thursday, Mrs. Clinton will tackle the issue of ballot access head-on in an address at Texas Southern University, a historically black college in Houston. She is expected to condemn the Supreme Court’s 2013 ruling striking down an important provision of the Voting Rights Act, which opened the way for states to pass laws requiring voters to present government-issued photo identification at the polls.\nMrs. Clinton is also expected to single out laws in Texas and in North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin, which voting rights groups say limit participation, especially among minorities, the poor and younger voters who disproportionately cast their ballots for Democrats.\nHer speech, which is expected to be similar in scope and tenor to her remarks about overhauling the criminal justice system, will tie voting rights into the broader civil rights strife that has erupted over the recent deaths of several unarmed black men at the hands of white police officers, aides said.\nFor Mrs. Clinton, such speeches can do much to reinforce her liberal credentials while reassuring black voters who supported Mr. Obama that she is on their side.\nIn the same way, even if the lawsuits are unsuccessful, Democratic strategists say, they serve an important political purpose for Democrats by highlighting Republicans’ responsibility for the statutes being challenged. Democrats will also remind the party’s base that Republicans have tried to mobilize their own core voters by warning, as Mitt Romney did in 2012, against the possibility of widespread voter fraud by Democrats.\nBoth those points could help fire up minority leaders and voters, Democratic strategists say.\nRepublicans, however, argue that the lawsuits are a transparent ruse aimed at energizing minority voters, whom Mrs. Clinton badly needs to turn out in numbers similar to those Mr. Obama drew in his 2012 re-election.\n“I think it has been a growing trend in the last 10 years for campaigns to use litigation like this as a campaign weapon,” said Hans von Spakovsky, a Republican election law expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “The claims that they keep making, that this is going to depress turnout, just keep proving to be not true, and many of these issues have already been litigated.”\nAccording to the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, there are 14 states with new voter laws in place for the first time in a national race.\nThe lawsuits filed in Ohio and Wisconsin, like the 2014 North Carolina case, were brought by Marc Elias, a leading Democratic lawyer on voter protection issues who represents four of the party’s national campaign committees.\nMr. Elias is also the general counsel for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, and her aides have spoken favorably of the lawsuits.\nThe lawsuits are typically filed on behalf of people who say they have been, or could be, disenfranchised. In the Ohio case, a black pastor is among the plaintiffs.\nMrs. Clinton’s campaign is not a party to the lawsuits, although her aides have said her team supports them. People involved in the actions have refused to say who was paying for them.\nBut Mr. Elias suggested that the litigation was simply common sense. “We should all want to ensure that all eligible voters can exercise their right to vote and have their vote counted,” he said. “It’s unfortunate that some Republicans see a benefit in making it harder for people to vote.”\nSince the election fight in 2000 between George W. Bush and Al Gore, court battles have become a routine and increasingly strategic component of presidential campaigns. The new round of lawsuits is occurring relatively early and is a more preventive effort than in past election cycles, experts say.\nMore broadly, the legal campaign is shaping up as something of a delayed Democratic response to the Republican takeovers of a number of governorships and legislatures in the same states after the rise of the Tea Party movement in 2009 and 2010, as well as to the Supreme Court’s ruling on the Voting Rights Act in 2013.\nAs a result of both changes, a series of stringent state laws were enacted in some of those states that Democrats say are intended to curtail voting by important segments of Mr. Obama’s political coalition, African-American and younger voters in particular.\nDonna Brazile, the campaign manager for Mr. Gore in the 2000 presidential race and a member of a Democratic National Committee task force that was formed after the party’s disastrous losses in 2014, said she and Mr. Elias had for months been sounding an alarm within the party about voting-rights conditions in a number of states.\nInstead of idling, she said, Democrats had to “proactively” seek changes in states where voter protections might be changed, whether through litigation or legislation.\nRepublicans have used such laws for mobilization purposes of their own, denouncing voter fraud as they appeal to an increasingly conservative party base. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, for example, has repeatedly boasted to Republicans across the country about having enacted tougher voting laws in his state.\n“Any measure that protects our democracy by making it easier to vote and harder to cheat is a step in the right direction,” said Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for Mr. Walker. “This is a bipartisan issue, and Hillary Clinton and the Democrats are on the wrong side.”\nRick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine, called the Democratic lawsuits “long shots,” saying that so-called voter protection lawsuits had often failed in the courts. “In terms of success, some of these things are a stretch,” he said.\nMr. Elias emphasized that the seeds of the Ohio and Wisconsin suits had been planted before Mrs. Clinton was a candidate. Mr. Elias and Robby Mook, now Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager, began collaborating on voter-protection efforts last year, before it was clear she would run or that they would be involved, people briefed on their work said.\nBut their efforts now — whether parallel or in concert — involve much higher stakes. Unlike Mr. Obama, who could rely on a much wealthier Democratic National Committee to pursue voter registration for several years leading up to his re-election campaign, the party’s standard-bearer this time will have no such backup: The national committee has struggled financially of late and has largely outsourced its registration efforts to nonprofit groups.\nThat means Mrs. Clinton, if she is nominated, may have to compensate for underwhelming efforts to register voters by maximizing the ability of existing Democratic voters to cast their ballots.\nAs Mrs. Clinton prepares to head to Texas Southern University, where she will receive an award named for the former congresswoman and civil rights leader Barbara Jordan, some Democrats see voter protections as a safe topic for her to explore at this stage of the campaign, one that will not turn off voters she needs in a general election.\nBut Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center and a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton, said the subject was riskier than it might seem.\n“There’s been such a hotly contested wave of new laws that it’s not such a safe issue anymore,” said Mr. Waldman. “It’s not just something for Fourth of July orations.”","[""We should all want to ensure that all eligible voters can exercise their right to vote and have their vote counted.""]",1919,23,0.019190000000000002,0.00069,0.019880000000000002
"WASHINGTON — For more than six years, President Obama has directed his national security team to chase terrorists around the globe by scooping up vast amounts of telephone records with a program that was conceived and put in place by his predecessor after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\nNow, after successfully badgering Congress into reauthorizing the program, with new safeguards the president says will protect privacy, Mr. Obama has left little question that he owns it.\nThe new surveillance program created by the USA Freedom Act will end more than a decade of bulk collection of telephone records by the National Security Agency. But it will make records already held by telephone companies available for broad searches by government officials with a court order.\n“The reforms that have now been enacted are exactly the reforms the president called for over a year and a half ago,” said Lisa Monaco, the president’s top counterterrorism adviser. She called the bill the product of a “robust public debate” and said the White House was “gratified that the Senate finally passed it.”\nThe president is trying to balance national security and civil liberties to put into practice the kind of equilibrium he has talked about since he was in the Senate, when he expressed support for surveillance programs but also vowed to rein in what he called government overreach.\nMr. Obama entered the Oval Office with what he called “a healthy skepticism” about the system of surveillance at his command. But Ms. Monaco said that, in part because of his often grim daily intelligence briefing, the president was also “very, very focused on the threats” to Americans.\n“He weighs the balance every day,” she said.\nThe compromise on collections of telephone records may end up being too restrictive for the president’s counterterrorism professionals, as some Republicans predict. Or, as others vehemently insisted in congressional debate during the past week, it may leave in place too much surveillance that can intrude on the lives of innocent Americans.\nEither way, Mr. Obama’s signature on the law late Tuesday night ensures that he will deliver to the next president a method of hunting for terrorist threats despite widespread privacy concerns that emerged after Edward J. Snowden, a former N.S.A. contractor, revealed the existence of the telephone program.\n“He owned it in 2009,” said Michael V. Hayden, a former N.S.A. director under President George W. Bush, who oversaw the surveillance programs for years. “He just didn’t want anyone to know he owned it.”\nJameel Jaffer, the deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, called the USA Freedom Act “a step forward in some respects,” but “a very small step forward.” He said his organization would continue to demand that the president and Congress scale back other government surveillance programs.\n“Obama has been presented with this choice: Are you going to defend these programs or are you going to change them?” Mr. Jaffer said. “Thus far, we haven’t seen a lot of evidence that the president is willing to spend political capital changing those programs.”\nIn the case of the telephone program, Mr. Obama’s preferred compromise was originally the brainchild of his N.S.A. officials, who embraced it as a way to satisfy the public’s privacy concerns without losing the agency’s ability to conduct surveillance more broadly.\nIn the lead-up to last week’s congressional showdown, Mr. Obama and his national security team insisted that broad surveillance powers were vital to tracking terrorist threats, while admitting that the new approach to data collection would not harm that effort.\nWhite House officials said Mr. Obama was comfortable that history would show that he struck the right balance.\n“To the extent that we’re talking about the president’s legacy, I would suspect that that would be a logical conclusion from some historians,” said Josh Earnest, the president’s press secretary. Mr. Earnest said the compromise addressed anxiety about privacy but still gave the government access to needed records.\n“This is the kind of rigorous oversight and, essentially, a rules architecture that the president does believe is important,” Mr. Earnest said. “And that is materially different than the program that he inherited.”\nMr. Obama’s advocacy put him at the center of a fierce congressional debate over the surveillance program, which officially expired early Monday morning before lawmakers approved changes on Tuesday.\nIn the Senate, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, railed against the president’s compromise proposal, saying, “We shouldn’t be disarming unilaterally as our enemies grow more sophisticated and aggressive.”\nAt the same time, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, excoriated Mr. Obama, saying, “The president continues to conduct an illegal program,” a reference to a recent ruling by a federal appeals court that the original N.S.A. telephone data collection program was not authorized by federal law.\nWhat emerged from that debate was a rare bipartisan victory for the president, whose approach was met with approval by Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate. Even some of the president’s most ardent critics in the Republican Party endorsed the approach.\n“This is a good day for the American people, whose rights will be protected,” Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, told CNN last week — a rare example of Mr. Lee, a Tea Party lawmaker, agreeing with Mr. Obama.\nThe compromise on the telephone collection program is part of a broader tug-and-pull for Mr. Obama, who inherited a vast national security infrastructure from Mr. Bush.\nAs a candidate in 2008, Mr. Obama was harshly critical of some of that infrastructure, pledging at the time to review every executive order by Mr. Bush “to determine which of those have undermined civil liberties, which are unconstitutional, and I will reverse them with the stroke of a pen.”\nOnce in office, Mr. Obama did roll back some of Mr. Bush’s decisions — in one of his first acts as president, he signed an executive order banning torture. But his national security team has also embraced some of Mr. Bush’s methods, arguing that they are necessary to protect Americans against attacks and to fight threats abroad.\nMr. Obama talked about “putting careful constraints” on surveillance even before Mr. Snowden revealed the existence of the telephone program. Later that year, Mr. Obama explained how his thinking had evolved.\n“I came in with a healthy skepticism about these programs,” Mr. Obama said. “My team evaluated them. We scrubbed them thoroughly. We actually expanded some of the oversight, increased some of the safeguards. But my assessment and my team’s assessment was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks. And the modest encroachments on the privacy that are involved in getting phone numbers or duration without a name attached and not looking at content, that on net, it was worth us doing.”\nWith the passage of the USA Freedom Act nearly two years later, Mr. Obama must make his new approach work by maintaining a focus on security while doing more to respect privacy.\n“Certainly,” Ms. Monaco said, “we are going to be focused on that.”","[""People generally expect their government to balance national security and civil liberties.""]",1565,14,0.01565,0.00042,0.01607
"For years, critics of the bailouts during the financial crisis argued that the rescue efforts weren’t harsh enough. The chief executives of failing institutions should have lost their jobs. Shareholders should have suffered more pain. Taxpayers should have received substantial compensation for the risk they took.\nAll that did come to pass in one case: the bailout of the American International Group, the large insurer and symbol of the crisis. Yet on Monday, a judge in Washington decided that the government’s actions were too severe, and the rescue was illegal.\nWhen the Federal Reserve propped up A.I.G. in September 2008, unlike its approach with most of the big banks, it threw out the company’s chief executive and took control of 79.9 percent of the company, nearly wiping out many of its shareholders. Taxpayers got all of their money back, and then some, receiving a profit of more than $20 billion.\nBut in a stunning ruling, Judge Thomas C. Wheeler of the United States Court of Federal Claims said on Monday that those terms were too “draconian.” In other words, he suggested taxpayers should have offered A.I.G. a more generous deal.\nThe judge’s decision could have far-reaching consequences should another financial crisis occur — and if history is any guide, one will. Legal experts say that the ruling, coupled with certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law enacted after the crisis, makes it unlikely the government would ever rescue a failing institution, even if an intervention was warranted.\nShould that happen, and the government decides it is handcuffed by the law from any intervention, taxpayers can thank Maurice Greenberg, the company’s former chief executive and one of its largest shareholders. He sued the government on behalf of shareholders, contending its takeover was illegal and unfair to investors. The judge largely sided with Mr. Greenberg, confounding many legal experts who considered the case a long shot. A federal judge had previously thrown a companion case out of court, calling Mr. Greenberg’s accusations “worthy of an Oliver Stone movie.”\nHowever, Judge Wheeler had a more sympathetic ear than his peers. He determined that the takeover of A.I.G. was orchestrated to “maximize the benefits to the government and to the taxpaying public.” Contrary to the conventional wisdom — and common sense — he said that goal was troubling. “The government’s unduly harsh treatment of A.I.G. in comparison to other institutions seemingly was misguided and had no legitimate purpose,” he wrote.\nStill, the judge did not award any monetary damages to Mr. Greenberg, making it a moral victory, but not an economic one. Mr. Greenberg had sought $40 billion and has spent millions bringing his case.\nJudge Wheeler determined that Mr. Greenberg and the other shareholders did not suffer any economic damage because “if the government had done nothing, the shareholders would have been left with 100 percent of nothing.” The judge cited John Studzinski, vice chairman of the Blackstone Group and an adviser to A.I.G., who had instructed the board to accept the government’s offer in 2008, telling the room of directors: “Twenty percent of something [is] better than 100 percent of nothing.”\nInexplicably, that line of logic did not extend to the judge’s ruling that the government had unfairly taken advantage of A.I.G. by requiring tough loan terms, including the equity stake and a 12 percent interest rate.\n“No matter how rationally A.I.G.’s board addressed its alternatives that night, and notwithstanding that A.I.G. had a team of outstanding professional advisers, the fact remains that A.I.G. was at the government’s mercy,” the judge wrote.\nJudge Paul A. Engelmayer of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who threw out the earlier companion case, had said that the claim that A.I.G.’s board was under the control of the government was specious. By the logic of Mr. Greenberg’s case, the judge had written, “a loan shark whose usurious interest rate is agreed to by a small business so that it may stay afloat could equally be said to have had actual control over that business so as to compel its agreement to a loan.”\nDennis Kelleher, president and chief executive of Better Markets, an advocacy group for financial reform, called Judge Wheeler’s ruling perplexing.\n“The court bizarrely expressed repeated sympathy for A.I.G. while failing to properly weigh the economic wreckage suffered by the American people,” Mr. Kelleher said in an email. “It’s the U.S. taxpayers that have been victimized here by A.I.G. when it acted recklessly, precipitated the crash of the financial system, took a $185 billion bailout, and then gave bonuses to some of the very same people who irresponsibly sold the derivatives that blew up the company.”\nJudge Wheeler’s analysis, in comparing how A.I.G.’s rescue was handled relative to the big banks, appears to ignore the realities of the regulatory oversight rules at the time. The judge criticized the government for taking control of A.I.G. while not doing so for the banks. But the Fed did not have regulatory oversight of A.I.G., which is an insurance company, and therefore couldn’t maintain the same kind of control it did over the banks. Similarly, the judge criticized the Fed for creating a trust to hold the shares of A.I.G. because the Fed technically can’t own equity in companies. “The creation of the trust in an attempt to circumvent the legal restriction on holding corporate equity is a classic elevation of form over substance.”\nThe government was sticking to its guns on Monday. “The court confirmed today that A.I.G. shareholders were not harmed by those actions,” the Treasury Department said in a statement. “We disagree with the court’s conclusion regarding the Federal Reserve’s legal authority and continue to believe that the government acted well within legal bounds.”\nWhile the ruling is likely to be appealed, possibly all the way to the Supreme Court, the head-scratching decision will undoubtedly have an effect on future bailouts, intended or unintended.\nHester Peirce, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, who is reportedly among the candidates for a Republican seat on the Securities and Exchange Commission, wrote last year that if Mr. Greenberg prevailed in his case, “it would strike a blow to too-big-to-fail by adding to the bailout calculus the specter of subsequent courtroom payouts to allegedly aggrieved shareholders.”\nAn earlier version of this column referred incorrectly to a case brought by Maurice Greenberg, the chief executive of the American International Group, that was thrown out of court in 2012. While it was a companion case to the one that a judge decided on Monday, it was not the same one.","[""Taxpayers should have received substantial compensation for the risk they took.""]",1524,15,0.01524,0.00045,0.01569
"Hillary Rodham Clinton delivered on Saturday her boldest remarks yet on race and gun violence, topics that have quickly become some of the most prominent and divisive in the presidential campaign, particularly after Wednesday’s mass shooting in Charleston, S.C.\n“It’s tempting to dismiss a tragedy like this as an isolated incident, to believe that in today’s America bigotry is largely behind us, that institutionalized racism no longer exists,” Mrs. Clinton said in a speech in San Francisco. “But despite our best efforts and our highest hopes, America’s long struggle with race is far from finished.”\nInvoking President Obama at times, Mrs. Clinton called for a “common sense” approach to gun laws, pledging to take swift action if elected. She did not, however, make clear how she would navigate the divide in Congress that has undercut Mr. Obama’s own efforts to pass gun laws.\n“The president is right. The politics on this issue have been poisoned,” Mrs. Clinton said. “But we can’t give up. The stakes are too high. The costs are too dear. And I am not and will not be afraid to keep fighting for common sense reforms.”\nMrs. Clinton’s strongly worded stance on the issue could help her make a contrast with Senator Bernie Sanders, who has been drawing large crowds in early voting states, where recent polls show him narrowing the gap with Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Sanders, a socialist from Vermont also seeking the Democratic nomination, has a decidedly mixed record on gun control, which may pose problems for his campaign as it seeks to bill itself as a more liberal alternative to Mrs. Clinton.\nSaturday was not the first time that Mrs. Clinton’s Democratic campaign, still in its infancy, had found itself having to address race and racism in the wake of violence. Her first major campaign speech, at Columbia University in April, coincided with widespread unrest in Baltimore after the death of a black man, Freddie Gray, who had been injured in police custody. Mrs. Clinton used that occasion to advocate an overhaul of the criminal justice system, saying it was “time for honesty about race and justice in America.”\nShe echoed that sentiment on Saturday at the annual meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, pressing for a candid national conversation on what she called a “difficult topic.”\nRace, Mrs. Clinton said, remains “a deep fault line in America,” despite the election of Mr. Obama, the country’s first black president. She also cited several statistics that suggest widespread inequality between black and white Americans.\n“Our problem is not all kooks and Klansmen. It’s also the cruel joke that goes unchallenged. It’s the offhand comment about not wanting those people in the neighborhood,” Mrs. Clinton said. “Let’s be honest, for a lot of well meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of a young black man in a hoodie still evokes a twinge of fear.”\nMrs. Clinton, who attended a fund-raiser Wednesday in Charleston just blocks from where the shooting took place later that night, also called Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina on Saturday to offer her support to him and his constituents, Mr. Graham said. Race and gun violence quickly reasserted themselves as topics of conversation on the campaign trail after Wednesday’s deadly shooting, which took the lives of nine people gathered for Bible study at Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston. Both Republicans and Democrats have scrambled to pay respects to the victims, but also to take a stance that may attract voters.\nMitt Romney, the Republican Party’s 2012 presidential nominee, took to Twitter on Saturday to press South Carolina to remove the Confederate flag flying near its state capitol.\nOn the Democratic side, Martin O’Malley spoke out for gun control on Friday, sending a strongly worded email to supporters calling for a federal assault weapons ban, stricter background checks and measures to tamp down straw-buying. In 2013, when he was governor of Maryland, Mr. O’Malley signed similar measures into law, making his state one of the most tightly controlled in the country.\nMrs. Clinton and her Democratic challengers will need to persuade minority voters, an important Democratic constituency that put its vote behind Mr. Obama in 2008, to support them in large numbers to win in 2016.","[""Gun violence is a divisive topic in the presidential campaign.""]",1007,12,0.010069999999999999,0.00035999999999999997,0.010429999999999998
"Periodically, it seems, an animal species arises to wreak havoc on the best laid plans of human beings. In years past, deer have eaten every hosta and tulip in sight, wild turkeys have chased homeowners off their lawns, bears have ripped apart bird feeders like tin cans.\nThis year, it is the coyote.\nIn New York City, where Eastern coyotes are having a breakout year, a glimpse of one of the animals is still rare enough to elicit curious amazement. But in the suburbs, the feeling is different.\nIn New Castle, N.Y., residents are warring over what to do about the animals, which attacked and killed a number of small dogs in the town this past year. In Saddle River, N.J., a man was bitten by a rabid coyote in April as he worked in his yard. And in Stamford, Conn., dozens of cats have gone missing, and coyotes have started attacking larger dogs, even German shepherds and golden retrievers.\n“Ten years ago, it was rare to see coyotes, but they have really exploded on the scene here,” said Capt. Richard Conkin of the Stamford Police Department. He said that starting in March, the animals seemed to become more aggressive. One resident had to fight a “small, scrappy coyote” off with a snow shovel. Another watched as the same coyote chased her shepherd mix to her front door, which she slammed on the animal seconds after her dog made it safely into the house.\nParticularly vulnerable are dogs and cats whose owners have installed invisible electric fences, designed to keep the animals from wandering. They trap the pets in while allowing predators unfettered access to the yard.\nMichael Dresner remembers the morning in spring 2013 when his family’s dog disappeared. Ruby, a miniature goldendoodle, was in the front yard of their Chappaqua, N.Y., home at 10 a.m. on a Sunday, kept in by an invisible fence.\n“My wife Jill heard a screeching noise, and we went outside and couldn’t find Ruby,” he remembered. They searched for hours but never found the dog, whom they believe was killed by a coyote. “Our suspicion is that she was attacked on our front porch and dragged off,” he said.\n“We chose to move up here because it’s wooded and not as densely populated as the city,” said Mr. Dresner, who relocated from the Upper West Side of Manhattan. “The concept of living in the country is that you can let your dog outside. But we didn’t expect we would live in an area with animals as violent as coyotes.”\nCoyotes, which as long as 75 years ago moved into the eastern United States from the West, are viewed by naturalists as a beneficial part of the ecosystem, because they keep rodents in check. They have been sighted in all 21 counties of New Jersey and every town in Connecticut.\nThey are now so well established — New York State has an estimated 14,500 breeding pairs — that any effort to reduce the population would be fruitless, officials say.\n“They are an intelligent animal and quickly learn how to survive in their environment, whether that’s the Bronx or Clinton County,” said Gordon R. Batcheller, the chief wildlife biologist for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. “They are a permanent presence in New York.”\nThroughout the region, animal control officers and private trappers work with homeowners and state wildlife officials to capture and euthanize problem or nuisance coyotes. That includes a coyote seen lurking around an elementary school, for example, or one that has preyed on pets in a particular neighborhood.\nState officials generally do not allow such coyotes to be relocated because that would merely transfer the problem to another area.\nMostly, the message from wildlife officials is that residents in coyote country need to adapt. “Just like you keep an eye on your kid in the backyard, you keep an eye on your dog,” said Larry Hajna, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. “It’s not modifying your lifestyle; it’s just common sense.”\nTips for peaceful coexistence with coyotes include keeping dogs on leashes, feeding pets only indoors, hazing coyotes (shouting, waving one’s harms) to prevent their comfort with humans and reporting any bold or aggressive behavior.\nThat advice did not help John Zeug, of Saddle River, N.J., who was spreading lime on his lawn in April when a coyote entered his three-acre property.\n“She came running at me, and I made myself big like they say you should do, and she ran into the woods,” Mr. Zeug, 78, recalled. “And then I turned around and 20 seconds later she came up and bit me in my left calf. She let loose thankfully and ran away. I had three puncture wounds, and one oozed for the next six weeks.”\nThe coyote was rabid, and Mr. Zeug required a series of rabies shots. State officials shot the coyote in his yard just as he returned from filling a prescription for antibiotics. They then discovered her six dead pups under his shed.\nIn Westchester County, in 2010, several children were bitten in communities along Long Island Sound, including a 3-year-old girl in the backyard of Tricia Ellis’s home in Rye.\nA necropsy revealed that the coyote was, in fact, healthy. But several months later, in nearby Rye Brook, another coyote, this one rabid, attacked a teenage boy at a birthday party, as well as a man and his 2-year-old daughter.\nMs. Ellis has since moved with her family to another part of Rye. Just last month, she saw a coyote on her street. “We’re very cautious about spending evenings in the garden,” she said. “You think it’s safe, but it’s not.”\nFarther north in New Castle, an affluent town that includes the hamlet of Chappaqua, coyotes have emerged as a flash point in the past year. After numerous reports of missing pets, including the Dresners’, and witness accounts of attacks, opinion in town was so divided that the town supervisor, Rob Greenstein, appointed two advisory committees to make recommendations.\n“It appeared that one group was more concerned with protecting coyotes, while the other was more concerned with protecting their pets,” he said.\nThe issue attracted the interest of animal-rights activists from outside the county. Soon, the town was being attacked on social media for waging “coyote jihad.”\nIn the end, Mr. Greenstein had the police chief and the town’s environmental coordinator distill the two sets of recommendations and devise a coyote response plan, which was made final this month. It lays out steps for the local police to follow, depending on the situation. For nonaggressive encounters, the police will, if asked, provide information on how to prevent human-coyote conflict. But if a coyote attacks an attended pet, the incident will be noted on an online map and the police may take steps to remove the wild animal.\n“We found that each side was so passionate about the issue that it was better for us to come up with a reasonable compromise,” said Mr. Greenstein, who is now being challenged for his town supervisor seat by the chairwoman of the New Castle Coyote Awareness and Safety Advisory Committee, the more pro-coyote group.\nJim Horton, a licensed trapper in Westchester County, said that he has trapped a dozen coyotes in the past year, but that in “99 percent of the calls I get for coyotes, I talk the people out of trapping,” he said. “Coyotes are here. They are here to stay, and we’re not going to be able to eliminate them from the area.”\nAnd coyotes themselves are not always the root of the problem. Two years ago, Mr. Horton offered his services pro bono when one was loitering outside his children’s elementary school in Hawthorne, N.Y. It turned out a neighborhood woman was feeding it.\n“We found pork chops on the snow,” he recalled. “This lady lived right across from the school field, and she was feeding the coyote. Her response was that she felt bad because she saw the coyote all by itself.”","[""Keeping dogs on leashes and feeding pets only indoors are common sense measures to prevent conflicts with wildlife such as coyotes.""]",1865,25,0.01865,0.00075,0.0194
"LACONIA, N.H. — There are many, many things Donald Trump would like you to know about how he would run the country. As he told a standing-room-only crowd here the other night, turning America around would be a lot like running the Trump National Doral golf club in Miami, which he bought when it was in bankruptcy in 2012.\nHe is really smart. “I’m really smart,” he boasted in Phoenix last weekend before rattling off his résumé highlights. “Went to the Wharton School of Finance. Even then, a long time ago, like the hardest, or one of the hardest, schools to get into.”\nPeople like him, clamor for him, must see him. Describing for an audience in Las Vegas how demand to see him at a recent event was so high, he said the venue managers had panicked and called, “begging us not to be there.”\nHe is not wrong on this last point — even if he does sometimes embellish the size of his following, as he did here in New Hampshire. He declared that of the 300 or so people who packed a suffocatingly hot banquet hall, there must have been three times as many outside. There were not. And by the end of his speech, that estimate had ballooned to “thousands of people outside.”\nBut the question that is giving so many Republicans heartburn today is how a man so few took seriously is suddenly a leading presidential contender. Listening to Mr. Trump as he campaigned across the country over the past week, and talking to the people shouting “U.S.A! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” who crammed into halls and ballrooms by the hundreds and sometimes thousands, shed some perspective on his appeal, and on the void he is filling in Republican politics.\nMr. Trump is not, as many Republicans have suggested, merely a renegade agitator who sneaked up on the party establishment and threatens to spoil its plans for a tidy, civil primary. Rather, he has become the new starring attraction for the restless, conservative-minded voters who think the political process is in need of disruption.\nSome align themselves with the Tea Party movement. Others call themselves independents or Republicans who are just fed up. The praise they heap on Mr. Trump — “He speaks the truth,” “He’s fearless,” “He’s not politically correct” — echoes the words conservatives have used to describe others, like Sarah Palin and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who have stirred their passions before.\n“I think he means what he says,” said Kristi Eglody, 63, a retired school counselor from Manchester. “He loves America, and he wants it to be better. And that’s what I love about him.”\nJerry DeLemus, 60, of Rochester, N.H., said he liked the idea of voting for a candidate who had not been in politics very long and found Mr. Trump’s swagger inspiring. “You won’t leave confused about where he stands,” he said. “And how fun would it be to watch him debate Hillary Clinton?”\n“We need the truth,” Mr. DeLemus went on. “We don’t have to like the truth. But we need it.”\nThe adulation that Mr. Trump is enjoying now can be a complicated, paradoxical gift. Voters like Mr. DeLemus, who said he tended to vote Republican and identified with the Tea Party movement, often draw motivation from outsize personalities like Mr. Trump. But they have also generally rejected any singular figure as a leader. And in that sense, Mr. Trump could find his moment fleeting, the latest showman to lead a movement that has so far refused to be led.\nMr. Trump has found success by putting a sharper edge on a popular conservative message: that the United States is an exceptional nation run by unexceptional people who are fundamentally altering what it means to be American.\nIn Las Vegas, he lamented: “We don’t have victories anymore. We used to have victories. We used to be great.”\nIn Phoenix, he said: “We have stupid leaders. The American dream is dead. But I’m going to make it bigger, better and stronger.” To chants of “U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” he vowed: “Don’t worry, we’ll take our country back. Very soon.”\nThe implication is that he will take the country back from incompetent leaders and undocumented immigrants. And this is where there is a darker side to his promises to make America great again, one that many critics, including Republicans, say feeds on xenophobia and racist caricatures of immigrants.\nTo reinforce his claims that Mexico is sending rapists and murderers across the border in droves, he has been traveling the country with people whose relatives were killed by immigrants who entered the United States illegally. He has them share their stories.\n“The illegals come in, and the illegals killed their children,” he said at a news conference in California recently as he introduced the victims’ family members. One man talked about how his son had been crushed to death under the car of an undocumented immigrant. A woman accused the news media of hiding the nationalities of the people committing crimes like these. “They never tell you what nationality they are,” she said. “Most of them are Mexican.”\nMr. Trump’s attacks on Mexicans seems politically shortsighted, many Republicans say. Every month for the next two decades, 50,000 Hispanics turn 18 and will be eligible to vote.\nAnd some of his supporters acknowledge that he has gone too far with some of his comments, though they still believe that he makes valid points about illegal immigration. “He probably didn’t really think about how that was going to come out,” said Paula Borbotsina, 69, of Manchester, who said she liked Mr. Trump mostly because she believes he would not feel beholden to anyone. “But a lot of bad people are coming over.”\nBut many of Mr. Trump’s followers acknowledged in interviews deep suspicions about Mexico. Some said they doubted whether President Obama was a citizen, a misrepresentation Mr. Trump has reinforced repeatedly.\n“Finally here’s somebody who has some common sense and is not just pandering to people,” said Tom Mosier, 77, of Bisbee, Ariz., which is near the Mexican border. Both he and his wife, Ginger, drove up to hear Mr. Trump in Phoenix and said they believed that the president was a Muslim and was not born in the United States.\nMr. Trump brushes off the charges that he is race-baiting and swears he has nothing but respect for Mexico — mostly because, he often says, their leaders are “much sharper, smarter and more cunning” than ours.\n“I love Mexico!” he insists. Same for the Chinese. “I love China! I sell apartments for $10 million, $15 million, $25 million to people from China,” he said in Las Vegas.\nMr. Trump’s events are drawing the committed and the curious. And the large crowds he attracts seem to be a mix of people who want to do more homework for voting, and others who just want proximity to a celebrity and a picture. While many say they are attracted to Mr. Trump’s candor and his success, there are also many others who are not quite sure they can see themselves voting for him.\nBill Davies, 53, was on vacation in New Hampshire this week and decided to drive with his wife to Laconia because they were both intrigued by Mr. Trump. Mr. Davies, from Boston, said he was impressed but not quite sold.\n“No one else is that direct,” he said. “No one else is going to speak their mind like that. But he’s a bit of a cartoon character, you have to admit.”","[""People generally prefer to vote for candidates who they believe are honest and have the country's best interests at heart.""]",1746,23,0.01746,0.00069,0.01815
"JOHANNESBURG — President Obama has not even left for his trip to Africa this week, but he is already getting a lot of advice about what he should — or should not — say about gay rights after he lands.\nSome politicians in Kenya have warned against bringing up the topic at all during his visit. Alarmist articles in Nigeria’s news media have argued that Mr. Obama will press the continent to accept same-sex marriage. Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe’s president and the current head of the African Union, mockingly said that he would propose to Mr. Obama.\nWith the United States Supreme Court’s recent ruling that same-sex marriage is a constitutional right still fresh in the minds of many Africans, Mr. Obama will be visiting a region where many have denounced America’s increasing emphasis on gay rights in its foreign policy.\nAs the Obama administration has increased funding of gay rights groups abroad, tied overall aid to respect of gay rights and recently created the position of special envoy for the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, some African leaders have responded with tough anti-gay laws and language that have fueled sentiment against gay people.\nActivists across the continent — many of whom believe that some of the American government’s measures in Africa have backfired — are waiting with a mix of anticipation and trepidation at what Mr. Obama may say.\n“Obama is not your typical American president. His father was Kenyan, and he’s coming to visit Kenya,” said Adrian Jjuuko, executive director of the Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum in Uganda. “There will be no other U.S. president in the position that he is in to speak about L.G.B.T. rights in Kenya, never. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”\nIt will be a chance for Mr. Obama — who will visit Kenya and Ethiopia during this trip, most likely the last one to Africa during his presidency — to reshape the narrative surrounding gay rights on the continent, activists say. On his last trip to Africa in 2013, Mr. Obama was seen as wagging his finger at Africans on gay rights during a news conference with Senegal’s president, Macky Sall.\nMr. Sall swung back, saying that laws governing gay rights were Senegal’s alone to decide. The United States should respect that choice, he added, just as Senegal, which had long abolished the death penalty, respected America’s position on that matter. The comments quickly established the script for other African leaders.\n“Obama should talk about it but not the way he did last time, which was too blunt, like a general speaking down to a young soldier,” said Ndeye Kebe, president of Women’s Smile, a lesbian rights group in Senegal.\n“There were repercussions all over Africa,” she added, contending that she and many other African activists subsequently faced greater harassment.\nCharles Kanjama, vice chairman of the Kenya Christian Professionals Forum, which opposes gay rights and has organized protests against Mr. Obama’s visit, said that the president’s comments in 2013, along with some American policies, had helped his cause.\n“That heavy-handed approach tends to result in blowback,” Mr. Kanjama said. “It’s clumsy and ineffective. In fact, in Kenya, what I would expect is if Barack Obama comes and talks strongly about this issue, organizations like mine will end up having greater financial support from the general public.”\nOn Tuesday, Kenya’s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, said at a news conference that gay rights was “a nonissue” and “definitely not on our agenda at all” in his coming meeting with Mr. Obama. A lawmaker in Kenya’s governing party, Irungu Kang’ata, has led a campaign warning Mr. Obama against mentioning gay rights during his visit. Any statement, he said, would be an infringement on Kenya’s sovereignty and the latest example of America’s effort to impose its values on Africa.\n“What informs America to hold the issue of gay agenda as being so key to its foreign policy?” he asked.\nAcross the continent, homosexual activities remain illegal in most countries, where colonial-era laws are still widely in effect. Only South Africa recognizes same-sex marriage.\nBut as the United States and European nations have pressed for the respect of gay rights in Africa, several African countries have toughened and broadened laws against gay Africans. In the last few years, Nigeria, Uganda and Gambia passed laws that imposed severe punishment for homosexual activities and gay organizations, though Uganda’s law was eventually declared void on a technicality.\n“It’s much more difficult now making the argument that these are colonial laws,” said Anneke Meerkotter, a lawyer specializing in gay rights at the Southern Africa Litigation Center here in Johannesburg.\nIn response, the United States imposed sanctions on Uganda and Gambia, though not on Nigeria, a richer and more strategically important nation. On a continent where many nations remain dependent on foreign assistance, the punitive moves, coupled with a broader policy that ties aid to the respect for gay rights, proved widely unpopular.\nThe measures tapped into a deep-rooted resentment on the continent that aid is a tool used selectively by the West against Africa.\n“The United States has used aid and imposed economic sanctions to encourage African nations to democratize, which most Africans support,” said Abubakar Momoh, a political scientist at Lagos State University in Nigeria. “But it’s a different thing with gay rights, which most Africans oppose.”\nThe sanctions hardened popular sentiments against gay groups, many say. More Africans came to believe that gay rights were a Western imposition. Nicholas Opiyo, the executive director of Chapter Four Uganda, a human rights group, endorsed the sanctions but said they created the “perception that the general population was being hurt.”\nEric Gitari, the executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission in Kenya, agreed that the sanctions caused widespread repercussions against gay groups across the continent.\n“They antagonized the general public, while we are seeking to be accepted and respected by the general public,” he said.\nThe State Department’s first special envoy for the human rights of L.G.B.T. persons, Randy W. Berry, said in an interview that the sanctions against Uganda were “very targeted” to avoid causing general harm.\nMr. Berry made his first trip to Africa this month since assuming his duties in April. In a low-profile, two-day visit to Uganda, he quietly met with government officials, activists and lawyers. Mr. Berry’s office did not publicize his visit until its end.\n“I want to be very, very mindful that my engagements are being as informed as possible to minimize the risk of unintentional blowback,” Mr. Berry said. “Because while I think we have a significant role to play — we can stand in support, we can engage with governments to encourage greater space and dialogue — ultimately, the change is going to come in Uganda or Kenya, just like it has come in any other country, and that is through an internal dialogue between civil society and government.”\nMr. Berry said quiet diplomacy was his style.\n“It’s a much more respectful approach than it was before,” said Mr. Jjuuko, of the Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum in Uganda.\n“It goes more toward dialogue and common understanding rather than threats and promises of hail for rain.”","[""Most people should be treated with respect and dignity regardless of their sexual orientation.""]",1633,16,0.01633,0.00048,0.016810000000000002
"Ivor Williams stood on his porch and stared suspiciously at the visitor who was pointing to the attic of his pink and shingled house near Brooklyn College.\n“I used to live here,” Steve Slavin explained, to no noticeable reaction from Mr. Williams. Then he uttered the magic words: “With Bernie Sanders.”\n“Bernie?” Mr. Williams, a 78-year-old immigrant from Guyana, exclaimed. “I was just watching Bernie on the TV.”\nHillary Rodham Clinton may be a former senator from New York who located her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn Heights, but all it takes to know who really represents Brooklyn in the race for the Democratic nomination is for Mr. Sanders to open his mouth and utter a few syllables.\nAs Mr. Sanders, a senator from Vermont, draws large crowds on the campaign trail and enjoys an unexpected surge, his ur-Brooklyn accent and upbringing in the heavily Jewish neighborhood of Flatbush off Kings Highway have become a particular point of pride for friends, former schoolmates and fellow progressives in the borough where he was born.\n“I’m very proud of the fact that he speaks Brooklyn, because he’s not a phony and that shows,” said Marty Alpert, who used to cheer for Mr. Sanders when he was on the track team at James Madison High School, where she now is on the alumni board.\nOn the school’s crowded Wall of Distinction, Mr. Sanders is no longer quite so overshadowed by such alumni as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Senator Chuck Schumer and four Nobel Prize winners, or, for that matter, Judge Judy and Cousin Brucie.\nMr. Slavin was Mr. Sanders’s roommate when they were both students at Brooklyn College. Now retired from teaching economics, Mr. Slavin recalled staying up late listening to music on Mr. Sanders’s record player and discussing Supreme Court cases, Marbury v. Madison in particular. And he remembered how Mr. Sanders would curse when they heard their loathed landlady angrily marching up the stairs.\n“He was a lifer,” Mr. Slavin said, meaning that Mr. Sanders had known only one place his entire life.\nIn fact, Mr. Sanders was on the verge of leaving — first for the University of Chicago, where he transferred from Brooklyn College, and ultimately for Vermont.\nBut Brooklyn’s imprint on Mr. Sanders was not limited to his tongue. In the populist politics he has espoused for decades as a leftist activist, socialist mayor, and independent congressman and senator, those who knew Mr. Sanders, who declined to comment for this article, detect the influence of postwar Brooklyn stickball games, arguments over money between his parents and the work ethic instilled in him as a decorated long-distance runner.\n“He is 100 percent Brooklyn,” said Larry Sanders, the candidate’s older brother, who decades ago traded in his Brooklyn accent for a British one when he moved to England and pursued Green Party politics.\nThe Sanders brothers lived with their parents in a prewar apartment building on East 26th Street that had a fake fireplace in the lobby. In apartment 2C, Mr. Sanders and his brother swapped nights in a small bedroom and living room, ate their mother’s meat-heavy dinners, and made occasional outings to the local delicatessen and Chinese restaurant.\nTheir father, a paint salesman who emigrated from Poland at age 17, worked out of Long Island and put 25,000 miles a year on his car. The family rarely discussed politics and, according to Larry Sanders, looked at their grandfather, “a very strong socialist,” as “eccentric.”\nWhat their parents did talk about was money. “There were tensions about money, which I think is important,” he said. “There was no sense of long-term security. A salesman, things can go up and things can go down.”\nBut if that at all contributed to the senator’s economic populism, then his appreciation for an equal playing field was influenced by the self-regulating society of street games outside their house.\nSid Ganis, a past president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who lived downstairs from the Sanders family, recalled a roving gang of Jewish kids who would play stickball, marbles and boxball, all without adult meddling.\n“In a way, when Bernard talks about cooperatives and so on, he is drawing on something that was real for many years,” his brother said. “That the people who did it, ran it.”\nMr. Sanders went to elementary school at P.S. 197 and spent his Saturday mornings at the Nostrand movie theater watching cartoons and serials with his brother. They took occasional trips into Manhattan, including one visit to Rockefeller Center where his brother recalled a “Vermont state propaganda place” that made the brothers marvel at the affordability of the land. When Mr. Sanders married years later, he used money from his wedding presents to buy acres in Montpelier.\nMr. Sanders started attending Madison, just down the street from his family’s apartment, in 1955. Walter Block, now an economics professor and libertarian at Loyola University New Orleans, would walk to school with Mr. Sanders through what he called a “pretty pinkish” neighborhood. On Bedford Avenue, they would enter a school that was a city in itself.\nWith about 5,000 students and split schedules between underclassmen and juniors and seniors to thin out hallway traffic jams, there was also a hunger to move up in the world.\n“We wanted to count,” said Larry Hite, a well-known commodities trader who graduated the same year as Mr. Sanders.\nMr. Sanders was a good student. He wrote for the school paper and ended up running for school president, but he had to settle for president of his class. His brother introduced him to Freud, and taught him why Thomas Paine’s “Common Sense” was superior to Edmund Burke’s conservatism.\nWhile others would eat pizza at Louis Gino’s, hang out at the Avalon Tearoom or avoid Dubrow’s Cafeteria after school, Mr. Sanders’s free time was spent on the track. As a tall freshman with a long stride, he became one of the borough’s top long-distance runners. He became so used to winning that in one race at Prospect Park, he pushed his co-captain, Dan Jelinsky, ahead of him “so that I came in first,” Mr. Jelinsky recalled.\nThese days, the school is pushing Mr. Sanders out front and center. Jodie Cohen, the school’s principal, talks about how happy she was when she heard he was running. “If Bernie wins and then Chuck becomes majority leader,” she said, referring to Mr. Schumer, “all of Madison’s dreams will become a reality.”\nMs. Alpert, the alumni board member, is also enthusiastic about the attention Mr. Sanders is getting. She said that when a counterpart at nearby Midwood High School inquired about creating its own Wall of Distinction, the Madison board members responded, “Besides Woody Allen, who have you got?”\nBut the end of Mr. Sanders’s years at Madison was not a happy time. His mother, whose heart had been weakened by a bout of rheumatic fever as a child, had taken ill. He lost interest in track, and enrolled, unhappily, in Brooklyn College.\n“He wanted to go to Harvard,” said Lou Howort, 73, a track teammate.\nAfter Mr. Sanders’s graduation in 1959, his brother returned from Harvard Law School to be close to their mother as her condition worsened. It was around that time that Mr. Sanders rented a furnished room with Mr. Slavin on East 21st Street in the attic of a Madison Latin teacher and his wife.\nMr. Slavin said his old roommate needed some space from the tensions at home, and that Mr. Sanders was crushed when his mother died when she was just 46 after a second heart operation failed.\nBy the end of his year at Brooklyn College, Mr. Sanders was more than ready to leave for Chicago. When finals came around, according to Mr. Slavin, he paid less attention to his exams than to the books he brought back from the college library. He was particularly fond of a biography of John Peter Altgeld, a 19th-century progressive Illinois governor who championed child labor laws, supported striking workers and challenged the Democratic powerhouse of the time, Grover Cleveland.\nNow, as he challenges the current Democratic powerhouse, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders’s hometown supporters hope that a combination of his unabashed liberalism, long-distance-runner’s persistence and old-school Brooklyn charm will resonate with voters.\nIt already does resonate with Mr. Williams, who shrugged off his own family’s analysis that Mr. Sanders’s being “straight-up honest” would only get him so far.\n“It’s great that the future president lived in my house,” Mr. Williams said.","[""People often take pride in their local connections to successful individuals.""]",1967,13,0.01967,0.00039,0.02006
"The morning after the third deadly mass shooting in six weeks, the presidential candidates acted as though they had not seen the news.\nRepublicans attacked Hillary Rodham Clinton over the personal email account she used as secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton went ahead with a planned speech about tax policy. Senator Bernie Sanders, a rival Democrat, talked about children’s issues in Iowa.\nOnly Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, speaking at a news conference outside the movie theater where three people were killed Thursday night, addressed the violence at length.\nBut Mr. Jindal, who is mounting a long-shot candidacy for the Republican nomination, completely deflected questions on tougher gun laws, saying he would talk about “policy and politics” another time, and telling reporters to focus on the victims, survivors and the heroic police officers who had responded to the shooting.\nThough most denounced the shooting and called for prayers for the victims — as they did after recent shootings in Chattanooga, Tenn., and Charleston, S.C. — none of the presidential contenders offered policy solutions to address gun violence, a reflection of the fact that gun laws are politically radioactive.\nThe leading Republican presidential candidates are overwhelmingly opposed to any effort to restrict access to guns, and have responded to the string of recent shootings by focusing on — depending on the nature of the shooting — spiritual healing, the threat of Islamic terrorism and mental health efforts.\nThe Democratic hopefuls have proposed gun control measures, but they have been generally more focused on issues of economics, race and gender than gun violence.\nIn the wake of Thursday’s attack, Mrs. Clinton made sure to acknowledge that “gun ownership is part of the fabric of many American communities,” before urging broad policies to address gun violence.\n“We must come together for common sense gun violence prevention reforms that keep weapons out of the hands of criminals and the violently unstable, while respecting responsible gun owners,” she said in a statement that was unlikely to offer encouragement to proponents of stricter gun laws.\nMrs. Clinton has, however, called for universal background checks and stronger efforts to block those who are on terrorist watch lists, suffer from mental illness, or have records of domestic abuse from obtaining firearms.\nThough Mr. Sanders seems to be gaining ground based largely on the support of liberal voters, he is compromised on the issue of guns in a way that Mrs. Clinton is not. The Vermont senator has previously been backed by the National Rifle Association and has argued on the campaign trail that guns in his home state, or in rural New Hampshire, are not the equivalent of guns in major urban areas like Chicago. Mr. Sanders’s campaign noted Friday that he supports instant background checks, tighter restrictions on gun shows and has a dismal rating from the N.R.A.\nAmong the Democratic contenders, only Martin O’Malley, who wrote an op-ed in The Boston Globe late Friday, made a forceful call for Congress to pass more restrictive gun measures.\nStrategists in both parties say that, regardless of who wins the White House next year, there is little chance for passing gun legislation because Republicans, who will almost certainly still control the House, will not bring any bills restricting gun access up for a vote. The only times in recent American history when significant gun control bills were signed into law — 1968, 1993 and 1994 — were when Democrats controlled the presidency and both chambers of Congress.\nAlthough President Obama said this week that the failure to persuade Congress to pass “common sense gun safety laws” was one of the great regrets of his presidency — just hours before the shooting in Louisiana — Congress is unlikely to close any of the loopholes in federal gun laws exposed by the recent shootings.\nThe bill in Congress with the most traction may be one that would give military officers the ability to carry weapons at recruitment centers.\nWhere Congress has faltered, the states have moved to tighten safety aspects of gun ownership. For instance, 10 states have made it harder for people with domestic violence convictions to obtain weapons.\nCourt records show that the gunman in Louisiana had a history of mental illness and had once been the subject of a protective order in Carroll County, Ga., which may have been detected with a stronger mental health reporting systems. That too is the subject of legislation languishing in Congress.\nNearly 20 states and the District of Columbia now have universal background check laws similar to a measure that failed in the last Congress, which may have blocked or at least slowed the gun purchase of Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez, who law enforcement officials say shot and killed four United States Marines and one sailor at a military recruitment center in Chattanooga. Mr. Abdulazeez bought his weapon on the Internet, an avenue that Senate legislation in the last Congress intended to make subject to background checks.\nThe man who the police say killed nine Charleston churchgoers had not completed his background check, but he was allowed to buy a gun anyway under a so-called default proceed. Federal law permits a firearms dealer who has initiated a background check to proceed with a sale if the dealer has not been notified of violations within three business days. Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, filed legislation that would close the loophole, but Republican leaders have not acted on it.\nIn the case of the Chattanooga killings, some of the candidates called for letting members of the military and National Guard arm themselves at recruiting centers, a move codified by bills pending in Congress. This week, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter responded coolly to the idea.\n“We need to recruit, but we can’t put people at unnecessary risk as well,” he said, saying that he would await the recommendations of commanders, “and then I’ll make decisions sometime in the next few days.”\nNo single law usually could have prevented mass shootings, which remain rare. Gun violence experts are increasingly interested in changing laws to better target those who have a demonstrated propensity for gun violence. For instance, a nonviolent felony conviction from two decades ago may well be less predictive of gun violence than a domestic violence protection order or drunken-driving conviction, said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research.\n“There is very little research that says what the best gun policy is to prevent mass shootings,” Mr. Webster said. “But we do have a good amount of research to show that when you have higher standards for legal gun ownership and more robust efforts needed to gain access you have much lower rates of gun violence. A lot of people have a hard time believing that because you never see a news story that some dangerous person didn’t kill someone today because they didn’t get a gun.”","[""Gun violence experts are increasingly interested in changing laws to better target those who have a demonstrated propensity for gun violence.""]",1463,23,0.01463,0.00069,0.01532
"WASHINGTON — In a stern response to Secretary of State John Kerry’s recent comments on the Iran nuclear accord, an Israeli official said Saturday that Israel would continue to criticize the agreement and could not be pressured to stop voicing its objections.\nIn remarks on Friday, Mr. Kerry warned that the international community might blame Israel if Congress blocked the accord and that as a result Israel might “wind up being more isolated.”\nMr. Kerry’s remarks, made during an appearance in New York at the Council on Foreign Relations, were taken by Israeli officials as a thinly veiled effort to muzzle their criticism.\n“We reject the threats directed at Israel in recent days,” an Israeli official said in a statement to The New York Times.\n“The U.S. Congress will make its decision based on American interests, which include consideration of U.S. allies,” added the official, who asked not to be named because of the diplomatic sensitivities. “The regrettable attempt to intimidate Israel will not prevent us from voicing our concerns about this deal, which poses direct threats to Israel’s security.”\nIt was the first response from an Israeli official to Mr. Kerry’s remarks, which occurred shortly before the Jewish Sabbath began in Israel.\nAmerican officials insisted on Saturday that Mr. Kerry had never intended to threaten Israel and were careful not to repeat his observation that Israel might be blamed if Congress stops the accord from being enacted.\n“Secretary Kerry issued no threats,” said John Kirby, the State Department spokesman. “He simply stated a fact: Should the U.S. Congress fail to support the deal, it will fall apart, and so, too, will any international support for further sanctions on Iran and its nuclear program. Iran will thus be able to start rushing its nuclear program forward again.”\nIn his Friday comments, Mr. Kerry also argued that the nuclear agreement, which would limit Iran’s nuclear program for more than 10 years, was overwhelmingly in Israel’s interest.\n“We’re gaining a safety and security, I believe, for Israel and the region that no alternative presents,” said Mr. Kerry, who added that he still considered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to be a friend.\nStill, it is clear that the considerable strains between the Obama administration and Mr. Netanyahu’s government have grown since the State Department submitted the accord to Congress on July 19 for a 60-day review.\nAmerican officials have been frustrated by Israel’s relentless criticism of what the White House considers President Obama’s most significant foreign policy achievement. Israeli officials, however, have been worried that the Obama administration is reluctant to stand up to Iran and is ambivalent about projecting power in the Middle East.\n“It is striking that despite years of stepped-up consultations, there is such rancor and mistrust between the Obama administration and the Netanyahu government,” said Robert M. Danin, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former State Department official.\n“Even more noteworthy is that their differences over Iran are being aired so publicly, even with their manifold channels of private communications,” Mr. Danin said. “This failure to come to a common understanding, if not joint approach, is harmful to both American and Israeli interests.”\nThe Israeli statement comes just days after Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter visited Israel to try to reassure officials there that the United States would continue to be vigilant in confronting what he called “Iran’s malign influence.”\nOn Friday, Mr. Kerry said that he would meet with Arab officials in Qatar in August to discuss ways to counter Iranian activities “we disagree with.”\nMr. Kerry said his goal was “to unify the Gulf world, and we hope Israel,” to “push back against” Iran.","[""Countries often voice their concerns about international agreements that they believe pose a threat to their security.""]",870,19,0.0087,0.00057,0.009269999999999999
"Barely more than a week before the Super Bowl, he appeared at a news conference wearing a sweatshirt, slacks and a woolen Patriots hat, and a two-day growth of beard. He affected a soft, doe-eyed innocence.\nWhy, no, Tom Brady told a news media horde piled into a Foxborough bunker, he had not a clue how his game footballs might have been deflated below the prescribed league limit for the A.F.C. championship game. He was an old-fashioned X’s-and-O’s guy, he said. This business of tampering with footballs was all too conspiratorial for him.\nThe superstar quarterback was reasonable and articulate, and if not for his conveying too nervous a sense of ease as he gripped the lectern, he was utterly believable — almost.\nNow, after an N.F.L. investigation, findings, an appeal and a hearing, we learn that Brady possessed a piece of evidence that almost certainly would have loomed as conclusive: his cellphone and 10,000 text messages. In early March, perhaps on the same winter day he met with a league investigator, he ordered that phone destroyed.\nRather than deep-six the phone on his own, making a soaring pitch into the Charles River or Dorchester Bay, he ordered an underling to destroy it. That, of course, left another witness to the act. Then again, the disease of rich and powerful men is to lose the ability to take care of even the simplest act on their own.\nMy natural inclination is to sympathize with defendants. Brady’s defense, however, has piled the improbable atop the unlikely and has tried my patience, not to mention my common sense. . His destroyed-cellphone defense calls to mind Richard Nixon, whose secretary, Rose Mary Woods, claimed that in a yogilike stretch of arm, back and leg, she had managed to mistakenly erase a key 18-minute stretch of tape that just might have proved that the president had committed a criminal act.\nOops.\nIt’s hard not to see Brady’s defense as shot through with a pampered star’s self-justifications and insistence on freedom from consequences. We know that there was a clubhouse man who insisted on going by the title of the Deflator and that he joked of going to ESPN with his inside knowledge. We know that Brady spoke and texted insistently with another clubhouse man. The N.F.L.’s decision, released Tuesday, noted that Brady had said these men were his friends.\nThe same decision noted that Brady had never called or texted his “friends” in the many months before the question of deflated footballs arose.\nThere were the usual plea-bargain talks between the league and the players’ union, which has appropriately taken up Brady’s defense. Brady, reports say, would accept no games missed.\nI confess to being of two minds about major league skulduggery. As a kid, I loved pitcher Gaylord Perry and his ability to hide spitters or slime balls from umpires who resembled private eyes out of Laurel and Hardy. The old American Football League was a pirates’ league, with all sorts of dirty tricks, from water-drenched fields that slowed star running backs to quarterbacks who greased up their shirts, the better to elude pursuing behemoths. But like Blackbeard and Captain Kidd, that time has receded into the mists of history.\nNow the N.F.L. is a button-down, $10 billion business, with tentacles reaching to several continents. And that does not include the billions of dollars wagered on every game, a practice that the league encourages with the publication of point spreads. Even the most discreet and silly illegal advantage could have a destabilizing effect on this golden child.\nBrady surely knew all this. He is, after all, a perfect and telegenic exemplar of that league, and for his talents and his preternatural ease, he has become terrifically wealthy. For all these reasons, Brady’s credulity-straining defense, the slightly ridiculous nature of the charges and the league’s oh-must-we-really-investigate body language, the entire affair played as amusing satire.\nThere was Commissioner Roger Goodell — who rarely looks more hapless than when he stands before the news media defending one depredation or misstep or another — forced to stare down one of his chief patrons, Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots. Kraft — known as the Master Kraftsman, in the words of an unctuous television network — had bellowed that there was no crime and that the league would be lucky to get off with an abject apology to him and the entire Patriots organization.\nKraft has since accepted his punishment, as has Coach Bill Belichick, who, in a deeply reluctant appearance at the same January news conference, insisted that he knew nothing about nothing, although the whole affair had forced him to clarify his “ball security philosophy.”\nA full reassessment of Belichick’s philosophy, “Introduction to the Metaphysics of Ball Security,” is yet to be published.\nThen came the release this spring of a report by the N.F.L.’s hired investigator, with excursions into thermodynamics, nonlogo gauges, and psig, not to mention the ideal gas law. Other evidence of illegally softened footballs of a more speculative nature has been adduced, not the least a learned study suggesting that the Patriots fumbled too rarely. That analysis met with a no less fevered attack from Deadspin, which rallied a great mass of regression analysis and axes of the sort that made me wish I had paid at least a little attention in math class at Bronx Science (somewhere, my advanced-algebra and geometry teachers nod in silent agreement).\nIt was dense and comedic at the same time. We learned, for instance, that Brady was quite particular about the amount of Lexol leather conditioner applied to his footballs. And now comes the league’s final decision, which is quite likely not the final word. Brady intends to march into federal court in an attempt to subvert and overturn rules that players and owners long ago agreed upon to ensure their mutual wealth.\nNot that any of this really matters. If the N.F.L. has proved anything in the past year, in which a star quarterback has been suspended and woman- and child-beating star running backs have nearly been run out of the game, it is that the fans keep coming back and the money keeps pouring in.\nBrady no doubt has every reason to think that by January, all anyone will care about is whether he can march his team down the field to another championship.","[""Destroying evidence can make a person appear guilty.""]",1485,11,0.014850000000000002,0.00032999999999999994,0.015180000000000003
"INDIAN LAND, S.C. — Twenty-five years ago, Ni Meijuan earned $19 a month working the spinning machines at a vast textile factory in the Chinese city of Hangzhou.\nNow at the Keer Group’s cotton mill in South Carolina, which opened in April, Ms. Ni is training American workers to do the job she used to do.\n“They’re quick learners,” Ms. Ni said after showing two fresh recruits how to tease errant wisps of cotton from the machines’ grinding gears. “But they have to learn to be quicker.”\nOnce the epitome of cheap mass manufacturing, textile producers from formerly low-cost nations are starting to set up shop in America. It is part of a blurring of once seemingly clear-cut boundaries between high- and low-cost manufacturing nations that few would have predicted a decade ago.\nTextile production in China is becoming increasingly unprofitable after years of rising wages, higher energy bills and mounting logistical costs, as well as new government quotas on the import of cotton.\nAt the same time, manufacturing costs in the United States are becoming more competitive. In Lancaster County, where Indian Land is located, Keer has found residents desperate for work, even at depressed wages, as well as access to cheap and abundant land and energy and heavily subsidized cotton.\nPoliticians, from the county to the state to the federal government, have raced to ply Keer with grants and tax breaks to bring back manufacturing jobs once thought to be lost forever.\nThe prospect of a sweeping Pacific trade agreement that is led by the United States, and excludes China, is also driving Chinese yarn companies to gain a foothold here, lest they be shut out of the lucrative American market.\nKeer’s $218 million mill spins yarn from raw cotton to sell to textile makers across Asia. While Keer still spins much of its yarn in China, importing the raw cotton from America, that is slowly changing.\n“The reasons for Keer coming here? Incentives, land, the environment, the workers,” Zhu Shanqing, Keer’s chairman, said on a recent trip to the United States.\n“In China, the whole yarn manufacturing industry is losing money,” he added. “In America, it’s very different.”\nSince Beijing and Washington resumed trade relations in the early 1970s, the United States has mostly run a huge trade deficit, as Americans consumed billions of dollars in cheap electronics, apparel and other Chinese goods.\nBut surging labor and energy costs in China are eroding its competitiveness in manufacturing. According to the Boston Consulting Group, manufacturing wages adjusted for productivity have almost tripled in China over the last decade, to an estimated $12.47 an hour last year from $4.35 an hour in 2004.\nIn the United States, manufacturing wages adjusted for productivity have risen less than 30 percent since 2004, to $22.32 an hour, according to the consulting firm. And the higher wages for American workers are offset by lower natural gas prices, as well as inexpensive cotton and local tax breaks and subsidies.\nToday, for every $1 required to manufacture in the United States, Boston Consulting estimates that it costs 96 cents to manufacture in China. Yarn production costs in China are now 30 percent higher than in the United States, according to the International Textile Manufacturers Federation.\n“Everybody believed that China would always be cheaper,” said Harold L. Sirkin, a senior partner at Boston Consulting. “But things are changing even faster than anyone imagined.”\nRising costs in China are causing a shift of some types of manufacturing to lower-cost countries like Bangladesh, India and Vietnam. In many cases, the exodus has been led by the Chinese themselves, who have aggressively moved to set up manufacturing bases elsewhere.\nIn recent years, the United States has started to get more attention from that exodus. From 2000 to 2014, Chinese companies invested $46 billion on new projects and acquisitions in the United States, much of it in the last five years, according to a report published in May by the Rhodium Group, a New York research firm.\nThe Carolinas are now home to at least 20 Chinese manufacturers, including Keer and Sun Fiber, which set up a polyester fiber plant in Richburg, S.C., last year. And in Lancaster County, negotiations are underway with two more textile companies, from Taiwan and the Chinese mainland.\n“I never thought the Chinese would be the ones bringing textile jobs back,” said Keith Tunnell, president of the Lancaster County Economic Development Corporation, who helped put together subsidies for Keer estimated at about $20 million, including infrastructure grants, revenue bonds and tax credits.\nThe inner workings of Keer’s factory in Lancaster County help demonstrate why yarn can now be produced for such a low cost in the United States and point to the kind of capital-intensive manufacturing that could thrive again in America.\nInside the 230,000-square-foot spinning plant, giant machines help clean the seeds and dirt from the cotton and send the fluff into carding machines that assemble the cotton into thick, long ropes of fiber. Workers then feed the ropes into machines that spin the cotton into spools of yarn or thread.\nThe work is highly automated, with the factory’s 32 production lines churning out about 85 tons of yarn a day. Even when Keer opens a second factory next year, it will hire just 500 workers, a fraction of the thousands of workers who toiled at cotton mills across the South for much of the 19th and 20th centuries — a big reason Keer is able to keep costs down.\nThe spools of yarn are then shipped through the port of Charleston to textile and apparel manufacturers across Asia. Keer also hopes to sell to apparel manufacturers in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, where many nations enjoy privileged access to the American market as part of separate trading pacts — as long as the yarn is made in a member country.\nSheng Lu, an apparel and textiles expert at the University of Rhode Island, said the high capital intensity of modern yarn-spinning meant that American mills were becoming increasingly competitive.\n“Common sense says that the U.S. imports textiles and apparel from China,” he said. “Now some of that is reversed.”\nBut cutting and sewing clothes, he said, still relies so much on labor that “it’s just impossible for the U.S. to be competitive.”\nInvestment in American textiles has not come just from China. Last year, the ShriVallabh Pittie Group, a leading textile manufacturer in India, broke ground on a $70 million factory in Sylvania, Ga., the area’s first new manufacturing plant in four decades. And Santana Textiles, a large Brazilian denim manufacturer, announced in 2012 that it would open a spinning, dyeing and weaving facility in Edinburg, Tex., though full-scale production has been delayed.\n“The whole textile world is looking at us,” Vinod Pittie, chairman of the ShriVallabh Pittie Group, said at the factory’s groundbreaking ceremony, predicting that the success of the venture would draw other entrepreneurs to open plants in Georgia.\nFor residents of South Carolina, Keer’s arrival could not have come soon enough. A generation of weavers and spinners lost their jobs when Springs Industries, which once ran some of the world’s biggest cotton mills in the city of Lancaster, closed its last plant in 2007, selling off its machines to a company in Brazil.\nThe global economic crisis hit soon afterward. By June 2009, Lancaster County’s unemployment rate had reached 18.6 percent.\n“They shut them down one by one,” said Donnie R. Gordon, who spent 17 years weaving cotton at Springs Industries until he was laid off in the 1990s. He now works in maintenance for the Lancaster County school system. “You could make good money at the mills, but those jobs just went away.”\nBut shrinking manufacturing jobs have spurred a willingness in places like Lancaster County to work for lower pay, making them increasingly attractive production bases. Global manufacturers have also been drawn to so-called right-to-work states like South Carolina, where there is little unionization.\n“I think I’m going to like it here,” said Enabel Perez, a former apparel factory worker and one of Ms. Ni’s trainees. Ms. Perez said she had jumped at Keer’s call for workers, an event welcomed in Lancaster County with a segment on the evening news.\nKeer’s gamble in America is not without risks. The strong dollar, for one, has added to the costs of producing in the United States. Water shortages in Arizona and California could also threaten cotton production, as well as jeopardize already endangered cotton subsidies.\nThe outcome of stalled negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade agreement that leaves out China, will also affect Keer’s American prospects. American negotiators are pushing for rules that would require apparel makers in member countries to use yarn from within the trade zone to enjoy tariff reductions. By producing yarn in America, Keer is hedging its bets, making sure it can continue to supply yarn to apparel manufacturers to countries like Vietnam that are within the T.P.P. trade zone.\nThen there are the cultural differences. Ms. Ni, one of 15 Chinese trainers at Keer’s Indian Land plant, complained softly of American workers’ occasional tardiness. In China, she said, managers can dock the pay of workers who show up late. But here, she said, she felt frustrated that she could not discipline tardy staff.\nRobbie Sowers, a 32-year textile industry veteran who maintains the plant’s spinning machines, called such differences minor. He said Keer managers had started giving workers six minutes’ leeway before calling them late.\n“There’s a lot of talent and experience here in South Carolina,” he said. “It’s just a matter of getting used to the American way of working.”\nAs she walked through the factory floor, Ms. Ni pointed to digital screens at the end of each row of spinning machines, which displayed in real time, out of a score of 100, how efficiently those machines were kept running by their operators. The screens flashed: 76, 85, 90. Experienced workers in China rarely let that number drop below 97, she said.\n“They’re learning,” she said. “I have to be patient.”","[""Manufacturing costs in the United States are becoming more competitive due to factors such as lower energy prices and local tax breaks.""]",2265,25,0.02265,0.00075,0.0234
"A federal appeals panel ruled Wednesday that a strict voter identification law in Texas discriminated against black and Hispanic voters and violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 — a decision that election experts called an important step toward defining the future reach of the landmark law.\nThe case is one of a few across the country that are being closely watched in legal circles after a 2013 Supreme Court decision that blocked the voting act’s most potent enforcement tool, federal oversight of election laws in numerous states, including Texas, with histories of racial discrimination.\nWhile the federal act still bans laws that suppress minority voting, exactly what kinds of measures cross the legal line has been uncertain since that Supreme Court ruling.\nThe Texas ID law is regarded by many experts as the strictest of its kind in the country. The law requires voters to bring a government-issued photo ID to the polls. Accepted forms of identification include a driver’s license, a United States passport, a concealed-handgun license and a so-called election identification certificate, a card issued by the State Department of Public Safety.\nThe law was challenged by voters, civil rights groups and the Department of Justice, who said it was discriminatory because a far greater share of poor people and minorities do not have these forms of identification and lack easy access to birth certificates or other documents needed to obtain them. Student identifications, voter registration cards and utility bills are not considered acceptable proof of identity.\nIn a sweeping ruling, a federal district court in Texas agreed with the plaintiffs about the effect the law had on minority voters. But it also said legislators had intentionally adopted a discriminatory law, a conclusion could have led to a restoration of federal oversight over Texas voting laws.\nAlthough the appeals court upheld the finding of a discriminatory effect, it said the lower court must re-examine its conclusion that Texas acted with discriminatory purpose.\nTexas could appeal the ruling, either to the full Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans or to the United States Supreme Court.\nIn a statement issued Wednesday afternoon, Gov. Greg Abbott did not say whether the state would appeal. But he did say, “Texas will continue to fight for its voter ID requirement to ensure the integrity of elections in the Lone Star State.”\nWendy R. Weiser, the director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, called the ruling “great news for voters in Texas and for the country.”\n“It does show the continuing relevance of the Voting Rights Act even in its weakened form,” said Ms. Weiser, whose organization helped represent some plaintiffs in the suit. “But it’s bittersweet because we’ve now gone through a federal election with this discriminatory voting law in place.”\nIn a 147-page opinion issued in the fall of 2014 after a two-week trial, a district court judge, Nelva Gonzales Ramos, said the law “creates an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote” and blocked its enforcement. She noted the lack of evidence that voter fraud was a threat and cited expert testimony that about 600,000 Texans, mainly poor, black and Hispanic, lacked the newly required IDs and often faced obstacles in obtaining them.\nTexas appealed her decision to the Fifth Circuit, which, without deciding the issues, put the ID law back into effect, saying it would be too disruptive to change the rules close to Election Day.\nThe appeals panel said Wednesday that because illegal intent to discriminate had not been established — in passing the law, legislators declared an interest in preventing voter fraud — the district court in Texas should seek ways to alter the voter law short of overturning it entirely. The state could, for example, reinstate the acceptance at the polls of certain forms of identification that may be more easily available.\nApparently referring to that part of the ruling, the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, said in a statement Wednesday that the decision was a “victory on the fundamental question of Texas’s right to protect the integrity of our elections,” adding that “our state’s common sense voter ID law remains in effect.”\nBut civil rights advocates focused on the court’s decision to uphold Judge Ramos’s finding that the ID law had a discriminatory effect, thus violating Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\nThe appeals court said it did not need to decide whether the law also violated provisions of the Constitution, like the 14th Amendment, and it rejected Judge Ramos’s finding that it amounted to an illegal poll tax.\nThe evidence that the law violated Section 2 was relatively strong, said Justin Levitt, an elections expert at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, because the racial difference in impact was striking.\nAnother case, in North Carolina, involves what some say are more subtle effects, and could provide a more telling test of the Voting Rights Act. There, civil rights advocates and the Department of Justice are challenging cutbacks in a range of measures used disproportionately by minorities, including early voting and same-day registration and voting.\nA second case in Texas, involving a challenge to the state’s redistricting, could also set an important legal precedent.\nIn the Texas ID case, the Fifth Circuit said that Judge Ramos had used improper historical and other evidence to conclude that Texas had intended to discriminate and that the district court should “give further consideration” to the issue.\n“This is a narrow but important victory coming on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Voting Rights Act,” wrote Richard L. Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine and the editor of Election Law Blog.","[""The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was designed to prevent racial discrimination in voting.""]",1249,18,0.012490000000000001,0.0005399999999999999,0.013030000000000002
"LOS ANGELES — When Alberto Fraire drives past a police car these days, he no longer worries about steep fines, or perhaps being hauled to jail and tangling with the immigration system. When California began issuing driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants this year, he was one of the first in line.\n“There’s a huge sense of relief now; it’s a psychological thing,” said Mr. Fraire, 37, who came to the United States with his parents from Mexico more than 25 years ago and recently leased a new black BMW to celebrate receiving his license in May. “I am not completely secure, but I don’t have to worry every time I get into my car.”\nMr. Fraire is part of an extraordinary milestone. In the first six months of this year, more than half of the new driver’s licenses issued by California went to undocumented immigrants like him.\nEven now, months after the program went into effect, lines regularly begin at the Department of Motor Vehicles in Los Angeles by 6 a.m., a sign of the continuing changes in the state’s population. D.M.V. officials predict that they will issue nearly 1.5 million licenses to undocumented immigrants within three years. Of the 883,000 total licenses issued from January to the end of July, 443,000 were granted to undocumented immigrants, the officials said.\nMany in the state applaud the license program, as well as other efforts by California to integrate undocumented immigrants into the economy, saying it simply reflects the demographic reality. California is home to nearly three million illegal immigrants, 40 percent of all such immigrants in the country. More than half of the state’s residents are immigrants or children of immigrants, with Latinos making up the largest ethnic group.\nWhile an overhaul of the nation’s immigration laws has languished in Congress, many undocumented immigrants have established themselves in California over decades. Thanks to recent legislative measures, they can receive financial aid and student loans to attend state universities and can be approved to practice more than 40 professions, including law, architecture and dentistry.\nMr. Fraire, for example, works as an electrician and plans to apply for a contractor’s license so he can open his own business.\nMost of the immigrant drivers who are now getting their licenses have been on the roads for years, usually driving registered cars with insurance to minimize the possibility of steep fines or of having their cars impounded.\nBut critics say that with measures like the driver’s license program, the state is interfering with federal policy. They argue that such laws will only entice more immigrants to enter the country illegally, increasing the need for public spending.\n“It creates even more of a magnet in what is already basically a sanctuary state,” said Joe Guzzardi, a spokesman for Californians for Population Stabilization, which advocates stricter immigration policies. “These are very tangible rewards to people who have knowingly and willingly violated the law.”\nStill, nearly 65 percent of the state’s residents see immigrants as a net benefit to the state, according to a January poll by the Public Policy Institute of California, a San Francisco-based research group. Many of the laws offering benefits of various kinds have sailed through the State Legislature with little controversy, often with support from both parties.\nCalifornia is hardly alone in offering benefits to undocumented immigrants; a dozen states allow them to get driver’s licenses, and more offer in-state tuition rates at public universities. But no other state’s efforts come close to the breadth of those California officials have pursued.\nUnder the budget approved this year, children from low-income families, regardless of their immigration status, will receive subsidized health care. Lawmakers are also considering legislation to allow undocumented immigrants to pay for health insurance through the state’s public exchange. And a bill that would give agricultural workers permits and protect them from deportation, the kind of policy that has historically been in the federal domain, cleared its first legislative hurdle with nearly unanimous support. Huntington Park, a suburb of Los Angeles, is moving this week to appoint undocumented immigrants to two unpaid advisory board positions.\n“If Congress isn’t going to act, this state will find its own way,” said Assemblyman Luis Alejo, a Democrat and the author of the driver’s license legislation and the agricultural bill.\nThe shift in public opinion also reflects the demographic transformation of the state.\n“Most Latinos know somebody who is undocumented, and we’re not some marginal community,” said Angelica Salas, the executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, which has lobbied for many of the state programs. “We’re really just going to some level of common sense. We’ve done in-state tuition and professional licenses for more than a million people. Lives have changed significantly, and the sky has not fallen.”\nIn other states, there has been greater resistance. For example, in Connecticut, which began offering driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants this year, there was an initial surge in applicants, leading to complaints about long delays for permits and driver’s license exams. The state’s General Assembly expected 54,000 applications in the first three years; nearly 50,000 were submitted in the first six months.\nMaryland has issued roughly 60,000 licenses to undocumented immigrants since January 2014, while Colorado has given out about 10,000.\nIn 2013, after California’s Legislature approved the plan to issue the licenses, officials spent nearly a year working out the details, including what the licenses would look like and what identification documents would be accepted. Initially, officials worried that eligible immigrants would not try to obtain licenses for fear that it was a trap. Instead, in January, when the licenses became available, the morning lines of applicants stretched around D.M.V. offices. The state hired 1,000 new workers and opened four offices that are intended specifically to help with the new licenses and that remain open as late as 10 p.m.\n“Right now, we only drive if there is no other choice, but that is often,” said Roberto Tadeo, 40, as he waited to take his written exam one recent morning. Mr. Tadeo had spent the last hour driving from his home in South Los Angeles to a new D.M.V. office in the city’s northern suburbs. Clutching the Mexican passport he used to prove his identity, he looked over his road sign flashcards one more time. “Now I have to prove I’ve been doing it safely all this time.”","[""Driving without a valid driver's license can lead to fines or legal issues.""]",1446,16,0.01446,0.00048,0.01494
"In a famous photograph from his childhood, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan is seen perched on the knee of his smiling grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, the influential postwar prime minister. There is no sign of the turmoil just outside the family home, where thousands were protesting Mr. Kishi’s plan to extend Japan’s military alliance with the United States.\nThe scene, and the parallels between Mr. Abe and Mr. Kishi, who died in 1987, have taken on renewed significance in Japan this summer.\nMr. Abe, who has pushed through a series of measures that would allow the military to send soldiers on overseas missions for the first time since World War II, is now facing protests of his own over his more assertive security policy. But he remains stubbornly true to his long-held ambition to reshape Japan’s national identity, stripping it of what he sees as a self-destructive pacifism while establishing some independence in military matters from the United States, the wartime enemy that became the country’s postwar ally and protector.\nWhile playing out as a domestic issue, the debate over Japan’s military posture has far-reaching implications for security policies in the region, where the United States has long held sway but is being challenged by a resurgent Chinese military that is increasingly willing to project its power. After a series of confrontations with China over territorial claims in the South China Sea, many Japanese officials have begun to harbor doubts about whether they can truly rely on Washington to defend the country’s interests.\n“A military alliance is a blood alliance,” Mr. Abe wrote in a 2004 book, explaining his thinking, which has changed little, if at all. “If Japanese don’t shed blood, we cannot have an equal relationship with America.”\nBut his push to give the Japanese military a greater role is being met with growing protests that, though smaller than those of two generations ago, have nonetheless raised the temperature of long-simmering national debates and cut into Mr. Abe’s political standing.\nQuestions have been raised about how far Japan should go in rebuilding its military power and whether it should broaden the reach of its security partnership with the United States to areas far beyond its own borders. A string of anniversaries commemorating the war’s end 70 years ago have given the issues an extra charge.\nMr. Abe, political scientists and historians say, sees himself as a transformative leader whose mission is to impose decisive answers on these questions, and in so doing, to drag this reluctant nation toward goals he shares with his grandfather.\n“Kishi wanted to clear away the remnants of the war, but he felt he was never able to complete the task,” said Yoshihisa Hara, a professor at Tokyo International University, who interviewed Mr. Kishi extensively several years before his death. “Abe worships his grandfather, and he’s taken up his mantle.”\nTakashi Shinobu, a professor at Nihon University, said both men’s politics hinged on an ambivalent attitude toward the United States, one that combined resentment over elements of the postwar settlement — especially the pacifist, American-drafted Constitution — with a pragmatic view of the military and economic benefits of partnership.\nWhere Mr. Kishi cultivated the United States as a shield against Soviet communism, Mr. Abe’s concern is the growing regional might of China, whose relations with Japan remain marred by disputes over maritime territory and wartime history.\nIn a statement that Mr. Abe plans to issue on Friday to mark the 70th anniversary of Japan’s defeat, he is expected to broadly uphold past official apologies for the country’s imperial expansionism. But even small deviations from accepted formulas could anger China and South Korea, another neighbor where resentment remains strong.\nMr. Abe is on the verge of achieving at least one specific goal that eluded his grandfather.\nLast month, in a stormy session, the lower house of Parliament passed legislation that would allow Japan to send its military on combat missions overseas for the first time since the war. It is now before the upper chamber, where it is also expected to win approval. Mr. Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party and its smaller coalition partner, Komeito, control a majority of the house’s seats.\nThe legislation, a package of 16 related bills, is the outcome of a widely contested new interpretation of the Constitution, which previous governments had seen as forbidding all but the most strictly defensive use of force. The bills would permit Japanese forces to fight only in defense of allies, and only under restricted circumstances. But opponents accuse Mr. Abe of doing an end-run around the basic law, which he lacks the political support to amend.\nMost constitutional experts say the legislation violates the charter, and some Japanese fear it could embroil Japan in American military commitments in the Middle East and elsewhere. While it was the United States that imposed the pacifist Constitution in the first place, it has long urged Japan to take on a more muscular military role. The Japanese public appears to prefer the status quo: Mr. Abe’s support has slipped below 40 percent in recent surveys, a little over half the level he had soon after he took office at the end of 2012.\nKuni Miyake, a former diplomat who was part of a group of experts advising Mr. Abe on history issues ahead of the 70th anniversary of the end of the war, said that while a more “mutual” United States-Japan relationship might soothe the pride of nationalists, Mr. Abe’s strategy was informed mostly by pragmatism.\n“He knows China is too big for Japan to face by itself, and the best way to ensure American engagement in the long run is to offer something in return,” he said. “If there’s a dream, it’s to become a normal, NATO-type ally of the U.S.”\nHow much closer Mr. Abe will get to achieving that dream remains uncertain. Experts said he was unlikely to drop his support for the formal constitutional changes required to give Japan a fully unfettered military. But the public backlash against the security bills was a reminder of the obstacles he faces.\nMr. Abe shares a comeback story as well as a worldview with his grandfather. Mr. Abe is having a rare second stint as prime minister, after resigning once in 2007 amid health problems and political-funding scandals in his cabinet.\nMr. Kishi’s comeback was more dramatic: After serving in Japan’s wartime government, he spent three years in American detention as a suspected war criminal, though he was never charged. When he returned to politics it was as a Cold War anti-Communist, complete with American support and funding.\nThe leftist demonstrators who converged on the Kishi home, in 1960, opposed his plans to extend Japan’s alliance treaty with the United States and allow the Americans to continue stationing troops and weapons in the country. Hundreds of thousands more surrounded Parliament, some clashing violently with the police.\nMr. Kishi pushed the extension through, including changes that gave Japan more say over how the United States used its forces in the country. But he resigned soon after, over the social unrest that erupted over the issue. Mr. Abe has written of the admiration he felt for his grandfather for sacrificing for his principles.\n“In his mind, that’s the heroism that defines his grandfather,” said Mr. Hara of Tokyo International University. “Abe isn’t ready to leave office yet, but on some level, he may eventually want to go out the same way.”","[""A military alliance is a blood alliance.""]",1660,9,0.0166,0.00026999999999999995,0.01687
"1.The Proclamation\nAlong the western bank of the Danube, more or less halfway between Zagreb and Belgrade, there rests in historic obscurity a three-square-mile teardrop of no man’s land. It is an artifact of a border dispute of long standing, and neither Serbia nor Croatia expresses a desire to rule over this unprepossessing Gibraltar-size property. The land, marshy and prone to seasonal inundation, is choked with unregulated scrub, with here and there the lone tongue of a poplar or the gentle shag of a willow. The only road is a rutted single-lane dirt track, the only existing dwelling a flimsy hunting hovel, its provenance unknown.\nThe absence of governmental authority on this land is due to the manipulated course of the Danube itself. By the late 19th century, the Danube was accepted as the natural border between the regions — at that point still under Austro-Hungarian control — that would become Croatia and Serbia. There, however, the river’s path was tortuous and difficult for larger boats to navigate, so engineering work was undertaken to smooth the snaking flow. The straightened Danube was a vast improvement for international riverine transport, but in the process, four large uncontiguous bulges of Croatia became stranded alone on the Serbian side, and one small pocket of Serbia, on what was now the far bank, became attached to the Croatian mass.\nThis latter pocket, which local residents call Gornja Siga, is the no man’s land in question. When the two countries were neighboring republics of Yugoslavia, these orphaned riverbank plots were of little concern, but since the 1990s they have presented an intractable problem. The stranded pieces of Croatia now contiguous with Serbia are some 10 times larger, in aggregate, than the rather trifling portion of Serbia now joined to Croatia; Serbia has been all too glad to assume ownership of its expanded territory, but Croatia sees the situation as unacceptable. In light of this ongoing disagreement, for Croatia to accept Gornja Siga would constitute a de facto recognition of the Serbian view of the border and a relinquishing of Croatia’s claim to the more considerable, though equally mosquito-infested and uninspiring, portions of Serbian bank.\nAnd yet Gornja Siga has come, over the last few months, to assume an outsize role in the imagination of many — not only in Europe, but also in the Middle East and in the United States. Its mere existence as a land unburdened by deed or ruler has become cause for great jubilation. There are few things more uplifting than the promise that we might start over, that we might live in the early days of a better nation. All the most recent states — South Sudan, East Timor, Eritrea — were carved from existing sovereignties in the wake of bitter civil wars. Here, by contrast, is a truly empty parcel. What novel society might be accomplished in a place like this, with no national claim or tenant? Such were the thoughts that had for some time inflamed the spirit of Vit Jedlicka, a 31-year-old Czech politician who traveled to the land earlier this year and, in broad daylight, planted a new flag in its unstable soil.\nIt was not the first tract he had considered. Previously, Jedlicka had rejected as too small a plot on the Slovenian-Croatian border, and as too inconvenient, dangerous and arid a dominion between Sudan and Egypt, which was subsequently declared the Kingdom of North Sudan by an American named Jeremiah Heaton, who traveled there by caravan to declare his daughter a princess, though his nation remained unrecognized by any other world government. What instantly differentiated Jedlicka’s aspirations from the minor follies of Heaton and other micronational leaders — of Flandrensis, the Dominion of Melchizedek, North Dumpling Island — is that he had stumbled upon acreage of what may genuinely be unclaimed land.\nAnd so, on April 13, 2015, he and his exploratory committee read, in English and Czech, the following proclamation:\nWe, the members of the Preparatory Committee of the State of the Free Republic of Liberland, issue this proclamation:\nWe, by virtue of the right to self-determination, right of discovery and the right of self-governance, proclaim the existence of the Free Republic of Liberland. The Free Republic is a free and independent country; and that as a free and independent state, the Free Republic of Liberland shall have the full power to defend itself, conclude peace, form alliances, establish commerce, and enjoy any other rights which sovereign states have. As a member of the family of nations, we pledge to abide by international laws that bind all states in existence.\n2. The President\nJedlicka had long dreamed of such a proclamation. An avowed small-government libertarian and euroskeptic, he searched for two years for suitable territory on which to establish Liberland. The man he intermittently calls minister of information technology eventually discovered the plot via consultation of the ‘‘terra nullius’’ entry on Wikipedia. According to the homestead principle, as well as the rules stipulated by the Montevideo Convention of 1933, Jedlicka felt the land was technically his after the flag-planting rite, carried out by Jedlicka, his girlfriend and a college friend. Though he claims he did not seek political office himself, and he in fact recused himself from the initial round of voting, Jedlicka was immediately elected the nation’s first president by a vote of two to zero.\nIn the days that followed his proclamation, President Jedlicka was unsurprised and unembarrassed by the dismissals of the international community; he knew recognition would come with time, once the land was properly settled and his intentions were made clear. The day after he declared independence, the Serbian government released a communiqué that declared the birth of the new nation to be a ‘‘frivolous act’’ that it was prepared to ignore. Croatia’s official position was that it considered Liberland to be ‘‘a joke.’’ When Jedlicka, soon after his election, tried to approach the Croatian foreign minister in Zagreb to talk over the matter, he says her bodyguards blocked his advances, and she fled on foot.\nThe President is a sturdy man of thickening athletic build, with blond hair and a reddish blond goatee that diminishes up his high-colored cheeks into blond peach fuzz and then asserts itself anew as bright blond bushy eyebrows over long platinum lashes. He is a soft-spoken, gentle ruler, well mannered and with a schoolboyish eagerness to please. For the first three weeks after the flag-planting ceremony, he and his founding committee could come and go from Liberland as they liked. He spent most of his time at the first Liberlandian Embassy, in Prague, a terraced apartment in the sun atop a hillside not far from Wenceslas Square that is also his home. (Jedlicka enjoys the free and casual use of such terms as ‘‘embassy,’’ ‘‘ambassador’’ and ‘‘minister,’’ though in his more legalistic moods, he is careful to qualify all of them with the adjective ‘‘future.’’) Then, on weekends, he drove the eight hours to Liberland at his leisure.\nBy May 8, though, which Jedlicka had planned as Liberation Day, his initial command of the situation had begun to erode. Domestically, the legitimacy of his administration was being challenged by a group that called itself the Liberland Settlement Association. The L.S.A., led by a Danish Bitcoin trader living in Switzerland, took at face value the President’s initial declaration of Liberland as a radical libertarian experiment: They moved quickly to settle Liberland themselves, on the premise that it was as much theirs as anyone’s. On the foreign-policy front, meanwhile, the Croatians lost their patience with the increasingly aggressive and populous homesteaders and were denying entry to Liberland. Croatian police apprehended all Liberlanders who attempted to enter. Jedlicka was arrested and thrown in jail twice.\nAs a resilient type and an incurable optimist, the President was prepared to forget the various diplomatic affronts, and he quickly came to view the situation with Croatia in a positive light. He had learned from his extensive experience with social media that all attention is good attention and that even no attention could still be considered, at the very least, some attention.\n‘‘If they help us, they help us,’’ he calmly explained to his ambassadorial team in Paris, which, along with most of his international supporters, took a rather dimmer view of the Croatian question than he did. ‘‘If they ignore us, they help us. If they harm us, they help us.’’\nWhat further ballooned the President’s spirits amid the national conflict was the great pneuma of world solidarity. Within just a few weeks, he had received, via the Internet, more than 330,000 applications for citizenship. He had posted the citizenship application online in two parts, an initial registration and a subsequent questionnaire. The questionnaire asked if the applicant had a criminal history; if he or she was in debt; was respectful of the property of others; was interested in investing money in Liberland; was a member of an extremist group; if he or she wanted to reside in Liberland itself, and, if so, how. About 40,000 of the initial registrants filled out the entire questionnaire. Final citizenship, for the moment, remained in Jedlicka’s hands, and by June he had awarded only about 130 of what he was referring to (pending constitutional confirmation) as honorary citizenships, mostly to those who showed the greatest commitment to the cause. Liberland was, after all, a tiny nation; he feared his experiment would implode under the weight of too many citizens right away.\nThe President imagined that the majority of freedom-loving interest would come from those seeking greater freedom in general, as opposed to political freedoms in particular, so he had not necessarily expected that the overwhelming interest in his nation would come from North Africa and the Middle East. The greatest number of registrants — 82,167 — came from Egypt. After the Egyptians, the most represented were the Turks, who almost certainly included Syrian refugees; after that came Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. The Czech Republic was seventh, followed by the United States. Then it was Iraq and Jordan. Jedlicka was both proud of this fact and slightly troubled by it. Still, his first principle was that Liberland should stand for the free movement of persons — with the exception of neo-Nazis, communists and convicted felons — as well as goods and capital; the question of political asylum, like many other small details of refined governance, could be safely worked out down the line, once the land was delivered from Croatian tyranny.\nJedlicka proclaimed that in Liberland ‘‘government will be banned except for three things: security, legal stuff and diplomacy.’’ His more specific platform was in constant flux, as he fielded suggestions and emendations from his supporters, but the pillars of his libertarianism were minimal government, complete privatization of schools and health care, voluntary taxation in the form of crowdfunded state expenditures and cryptocurrency. On some issues, he felt that more discussion was needed before he could divine the proper position. There was, for example, the matter of immigration. On the one hand, the President believed in the free movement of people; on the other, he understood that many fellow libertarians and euroskeptics believed that unrestricted immigration, particularly by economic migrants and refugees, placed too great a burden on a community created to beget wealth. On this and similar questions, he left the door open to spirited debate.\nBefore any of these questions could be addressed, however, he had to advance Part 1 of his plan for establishing Liberland as a sovereign state: namely, to gain physical control over the territory. This had already proved more perplexing than anticipated. The Croatians regarded Liberland as Serbian territory; if you crossed overland, from the Croatian side, you were thus performing an illegal international crossing outside an official border checkpoint. If you crossed by water from the Serbian side, the Croatian police were technically arresting someone for crossing from Serbia to Serbia. The L.S.A. decided that mass arrests would inevitably bring international attention to the Croatian infringement on Liberlandian sovereignty, but the President knew firsthand the discomfort of the Croatian prison, and he did not want any more of his future citizens to suffer there. His tactic would be diplomatic, and he had to that end sought an alliance with a Czech member of the European Parliament. If the Croatian police arrested the holder of a diplomatic passport upon debarkation, they would provoke an incident with global repercussions; Liberland was a voluntary signatory to various international treaties and charters, and the Croatian provocation would not go unnoticed. The diplomat, Tomas Zdechovsky, a Czech member of the European Parliament, had agreed to the mission, which was to be held on a weekend in early June. The diplomat would attempt a landing at Liberland — which for a month no Liberlandian citizen or supporter had done without immediate arrest — and see if the Croatian police were willing to subject themselves to the scrutiny of the international community.\n3. The Diplomatic Mission\nThe first diplomatic mission to Liberland convened at the Prague airport’s old Terminal 1. The flight would be aboard AIR-Liberland, which was not a state asset but a private enterprise contracted to provide regular air service to the Croatian castle city of Osijek, about 20 miles overland from Liberland. Jedlicka had secured, by virtue of this arrangement, a lifetime of free personal transit on the airline. For him, the gesture comported with the dignity of his office, but to his detractors, it recalled the kind of crony capitalism that Liberland had been invented to circumvent.\nThough not vain, the President is a man of probity, always conscious of the freshness and propriety of his appearance, and he wore a pressed azure suit with a slight shine; the diplomat wore a blazer with a sewn-in pocket square in maroon and blue. Zdechovsky describes himself as a politician, crisis manager, media analyst, author and poet; he is an acquaintance of Jedlicka’s from the bruising small-town politics of central Bohemia, where they campaigned against each other in the last European parliamentary elections.\nThe aircraft was given an approach to Osijek over Liberland itself, and the President took a series of selfies with the sandy beach of Liberty Island, a soft crescent in the waters just off Liberland proper, in the background. It was his personal favorite geographical feature of his country. When he thinks of its sucrose shores, which had been host to his early presidential cavorting and now lay just beyond his reach, he is often moved to comment that ‘‘Liberland is not just a tax paradise, it is also a paradise of a sort.’’\nOn the drive from Osijek to the Croatian border checkpoint, Jedlicka fielded more than two dozen calls, answering each one with the phrase, ‘‘Yes, this is the president.’’ Many of his contacts had never reached a head of state with so little intermediatory fuss. The President had more than a hundred messages via at least six apps to respond to and had to restart his phone more than once when its circuits needed cooling. He had left his own reserve battery on AIR-Liberland, so he borrowed a white power brick from a Canadian-Slovak named Vince Pillar, one of the President’s growing cadre of assistants, who moved through life in a cloud of sweet banana-chocolate vape exhaust; the cable was too short, so Jedlicka had to hold both the brick and his phone to his ear to talk. We drove by the land entrance to Liberland, which for weeks was blocked by a compact white police car.\nAfter about an hour, Jedlicka’s entourage arrived at the Liberlandian base camp, a sagging military tarpaulin stretched into a tent over a little field half-cleared of brambles on the Serbian side, about two miles upstream from Liberland itself. There were engine problems with Liberland’s official boat, so the mission was delayed until another boat could be made available. On the far side of the river, 850 yards away, the peaks of squat orange-roofed Croatian houses crouched behind a large defensive embankment were visible. The thick berm had been built to protect against the river’s flood season, as well as the mosquitoes that bred without regulation in the bogs. As we waited, someone shooed one of the wild boars, a prodigious sow running impressively free of governance, back into the thick brush.\nIn the distance we could at last spy a small metal dinghy speeding north from Liberland toward the camp. The men and women from the boat hopped ashore, the tallest of the five waving a Liberland flag the size of a bedsheet. He was a tall man of considerable bulk, with long, thick hair swept back underneath a fraying straw cap and a Guy Fawkes beard. He wore a thin white short-sleeved dress shirt with an open collar and a Rolex tight around his wrist; at his collar’s notch he wore a gunmetal medallion, with bas-relief imagery of a skull wearing a top hat alongside a gun. This was Niklas Nikolajsen, the director of the Liberland Settlement Association.\nA Danish software engineer who now describes himself as a Bitcoin broker, Nikolajsen founded the L.S.A. just days after Jedlicka declared the establishment of Liberland. He was suspicious of the President’s self-declared presidency and decided to stake his own claim. The L.S.A. was incorporated in Switzerland as a limited-liability company, but it had quickly matured into an autonomous faction of political hooligans that now rivaled the President’s authority.\nNikolajsen lived in Zug, a small mountainous canton of Switzerland. He paid a tax rate of only about 4 percent, perhaps one of the lowest rates in all of Europe. But what if, Nikolajsen asked himself, ‘‘you could even improve on that?’’ This wasn’t just a selfish thought, though he wouldn’t mind paying no taxes; it was also about all of those people who for some reason couldn’t live in Switzerland. ‘‘If you’re sitting somewhere nice, you think, Well, you could spread freedom,’’ he said. The idea had particular appeal in the context of the Balkans, where a byzantine regulatory apparatus allowed for a flourishing lawlessness. ‘‘In many European languages, when things are really bad and bureaucratic, you call it ‘Balkan conditions,’ and there’s a reason for it,’’ Nikolajsen said.\nDespite the fragile entente between the President and the L.S.A., there were undercurrents of soft-power maneuvering on both sides, and the threat of schism remained. Earlier that month, the L.S.A. posted an aggressive piece on its website titled ‘‘Liberland’s Constitution: Is It Libertarian Enough?’’ It subtly undermined Jedlicka at every turn, suggesting that he might not be as freethinking as advertised. Where the President had wanted a clause prohibiting public assembly that infringed upon the rights of others, the L.S.A. worried this would be used as a way of ‘‘squashing protests.’’ More alarming, the President seemed to imply, in an article relating to the denial of gun permits to the mentally ill, that there might be any procedure at all to license firearms. The L.S.A. objected, along similar ideological lines, to Jedlicka’s provision that the poor might have the right to gratis legal representation.\nNikolajsen understood that the real promise and the real threat of Liberland was as a libertarian free-for-all: the Croatians feared an armed redoubt of brothels and meth labs, and they were right to worry. ‘‘I created a hundred thousand shares of the company,’’ he bragged to me. ‘‘I sold them all out to investors in the first 40 hours. Everybody wanted a piece. I never sold anything so fast. That’s when I knew this was serious. You can always trust a market. You can’t trust yourself, you can’t trust your mother, but you can trust a market, because it shows you that what you have is something everybody wants.’’\n4. The Policija\nAt last the first diplomatic mission was ready to begin. Nikolajsen turned to Zdechovsky, the diplomat, as the company prepared to walk down to the boat, and admitted something that must have lingered uncomfortably in the minds of many freedom-loving settlers: ‘‘I have often been euroskeptic. But today I am totally for the European Union!’’\nWith the official state vessel out of commission, the small metal dinghy had to fit eight people. It theoretically had a maximum capacity of six, but the President found he was unable to say no to the four teams of documentary filmmakers who didn’t want to miss such crucial footage. The diplomat unwrapped four containers of kebab, chop and sausage, and laid them out attractively on very thin paper plates. The party picked at the food while waiting for a young Austrian in a blood-lettered shirt of a band called Ulcerate, a recent arrival Jedlicka hadn’t yet met, to inflate a rubber raft for use in a landing.\nNikolajsen stood on the shore, eyeing the raft grimly. He knew that the Croatian police would seize it as part of their ongoing campaign of punitive asset forfeiture. He and the President have profoundly varying notions about what might constitute a libertarian state, but they share an appreciation for national pageantry and its props. He called out, ‘‘We’ve been losing two flags and two rubber boats a day.’’\nThe President looked to Nikolajsen. ‘‘Can we have a flag?’’\n‘‘If you promise to give it back.’’ Nikolajsen fingered his gunmetal medallion and bit his lower lip. ‘‘It’s my last one.’’\nThe President reassured him. ‘‘I have more in my bag.’’\nThe diplomat, an official of ambition delighted to be at the center of this special and unprecedented mission, swept his hand across the meat. Its grease had soaked through the paper plates and onto the weathered wooden bench. The aroma of the patties had the distinct ranginess of horse. ‘‘Do you want something to eat?’’ he asked.\nThe dinghy set off at speed downstream, with the President and the diplomat in the stern taking turns at the rudder. They could barely see anything in front of the boat for all of the filmmakers and photographers, and they had to swerve so as not to hit the concrete pylon that supported the border bridge. The boat quickly slowed, however, and Jedlicka looked back to find that the raft trailing behind on its leash was filling with loden green river water.\nThe President sighed. He looked down at his textured brown oxfords, polished just this morning and now caked in gray mud. He and the Austrian hauled the raft up into the dinghy, where it rested between two filmmakers. He shrugged and regained his good cheer, throwing his arms up in anticipation of victory. ‘‘These are the obstacles creating a new nation!’’\nThe dinghy came around a bend in the river, the sun lower in the sky and the light a soft violet on the green width of the river, and the President stood up and laid his hand on the raft to take in the sight of his country. He had studied the poses of George Washington, whose likeness in oil graced the official Liberland Facebook page. Jedlicka beached the dinghy on a small sandbar just north of the Liberland-Croatia border. Black scathing cumuli of mosquitoes formed a needling vapor in the boat.\nJedlicka took the pump and reinflated the raft, which had gone soft in the dinghy. ‘‘This,’’ he said, ‘‘is how presidential work is done in the field.’’ His azure suit was soiled with sludge, and when he wiped the sweat from his brow, his hand emerged striped with black arthropod entrails and jags of the blood of his face.\nThere was a flurry of activity on the boat. With the raft back in the water and out of the way, all assembled could see before the dinghy, on its starboard side, a white boat with a blue tarp and antenna equipment. In clean blue lettering stenciled on the side, the boat identified itself as Policija. A man in a blue uniform and blue cap gazed at the dinghy through binoculars. A second policeman worked the radio on the bridge. The President stood up and waved. The boats drew up beside each other, and their bows plinked lightly.\nThe President spoke amiably. ‘‘We’re sending a diplomat now to measure our borders.’’\nThe diplomat said, ‘‘I am from European Parliament.’’\nThe policeman was impassive. ‘‘What are your intentions please?’’\n‘‘Now?’’ the President asked. The policeman nodded. ‘‘We send diplomat to measure borders.’’\n‘‘I will warn you,’’ the policeman said, repeating some lines in English. ‘‘Everyone who steps on the right side of the river will be arrested. This border is not defined. It is in dispute. Croatia defines one way, Serbia other way.’’\nThe diplomat got involved. ‘‘You must respect my mandate. There is European law here.’’\n‘‘We are not here to discuss with you,’’ the police official said. ‘‘Everyone will be arrested.’’ He hesitated, then pointed at the diplomat. ‘‘Except you. Your diplomatic passport protects you. We will inform our minister, and he will inform your home state.’’ The policeman seemed glad to be rid of these sentences.\nThe two boats continued to slowly circle each other amid the squalls of mosquitoes. The diplomat boarded the raft, with one of the documentary filmmakers, and they set off toward the Liberlandian bank, a gently sloping mud beach under a low canopy of dense foliage. The President started the engine and swung the dinghy, now much lighter, toward the center of the river. The two policemen tied their boat to a tree and went ashore.\nThe Austrian was encouraged. ‘‘They’re busy on the shore. We can go to Liberty Island and plant flag.’’\n‘‘Yeah,’’ Jedlicka said, ‘‘but you’d get arrested.’’ Happy with the success of the mission thus far, he was in no mood to countenance more bodily sacrifice. The young filmmaker who went ashore did not look prepared to spend the night in a dank, windowless cell of the border garrison, where 28 L.S.A. affiliates had already spent at least one night. The President swooped the dinghy in doughnuts around the middle of the river, peering over to see what was happening beneath the forest canopy. He smiled broadly, and two mosquitoes landed as black marks on his white teeth. On the shore, the policemen were arresting the filmmaker and escorting the diplomat to their boat.\nAs we set off upstream in the pinkening green, the President stood in the stern, sunburned, his face blotchy and cratered with scratched bites, his blond hair darkened by sweat and matted down. Roots extended from the eroded Serbian banks like long gnarled brooms, while the trees on the Croatian bank cast dark and extravagant emblems on the placid Danube.\n5. The Matrix\nThe Ryanair flight to London gave the President his first time to think in several days. He felt, it was clear, that what was required at this clotted, uncertain juncture was a sense of destiny. The only way he could retake full control from the L.S.A. and rally his own troops against the threat of Croatian incursion was to offer his followers a strong and coherent vision for how the nation would be established.\nWhat the President already knew was the following: The nation would be run by a legislative assembly of 20 individuals, but all laws could be vetoed by public referendum. He already had a designer’s rendering of the future parliament building. It looked like a ranch house with an enormous porch, its roof arched in segments like a scaly fish in flight. ‘‘The entire government,’’ Jedlicka insisted, ‘‘will fit into this building, and will not ever grow larger.’’ As far as future construction went, there were varying points of view on how many people could fit on Liberland itself, but at least one artist on the Internet had imagined a hyperdense city of towering skyscrapers. Liberland was mostly marsh, however, and Jedlicka was not sure about the price of the necessary pylons. Beyond that issue, it was important to him that people not forget that his project was not solely about this small parcel of boar-crossed, mosquito-fogged swampland. This was a unique opportunity to create a worldwide movement for freedom — a way to distribute freedom instead of just concentrating it in this small state.\nExactly how to further this objective was on the President’s mind en route to London. With his mobile phone on airplane mode and his Bluetooth headset stowed, the future of Liberland came upon him as a revelation. The country’s fate rested in his ability to construct a vast online work-flow app. Its integrated user interface would optimize the operations necessary to realize nationhood. It would render public the assigning and fulfillment of the remaining tasks; connect Liberlandians to one another, for cooperative purposes, via a messaging-and-commenting system; and streamline the gratification of logistical needs via a full-dress reservation portal for flights, buses, taxis and lodging.\nThough the whole thing sounded complicated, the site design itself would be simple and intuitive. It would resemble an organizational table. Each column would represent a country, and the rows would be labeled with necessary positions: ambassador, financial minister, photographer, videographer, publicity person. Each cell would then be color coded: green would indicate a task assigned and completed, yellow a task merely assigned and red a task in need of the application of industry. Carrying out tasks would earn points, which could then be put toward the purchase of citizenship. This plan, the President believed, would create a currency that, despite the absence of a central bank or a foundational debt, would have value from the beginning: It would be tied to the labor of nation-building and would unleash extraordinary energy toward that end. The name of the currency was also revealed to him on the meditative Ryanair journey: the Liberlandian merit. His would be the planet’s first fully merit-based country.\nDespite an unusually hard landing, it was the President, in his crystalline, buzzing elation, who began to clap, with charisma; the rest of the cabin, dazed and a little rattled, soon fell in behind him with applause.\nJedlicka was greeted by a future citizen holding a Liberland sign complete with national insignia. He was a handsome, tanned, bald man of about 40, and he wore a short purple tie, hung loosely about his collar, over an untucked pinstriped shirt. The aspiring citizen, Jay Picard, said he felt completely overdressed, and removed his tie by drawing the intact loop over his head. He was as eager and nervous to meet the President as the President was to meet him. Liberland already had an official embassy and ambassador in France and Slovenia, but the President had yet to find someone in Britain he could trust with local leadership.\nPicard showed Jedlicka to a racing-striped Mini Cooper, in which he had driven to the airport from his sometime home in Bath at, he claimed, more than 100 m.p.h. He turned toward the trunk, revealing a large tattoo of a bar code on the back of his head. ‘‘The bar code,’’ he explained, ‘‘is basically to say, ‘I’m not owned by the government.’ I don’t like to be a subject of the country.’’\nAs he took Jedlicka’s bag, he drew attention to the Liberland decal he had affixed to the rear bumper.\n‘‘Where did you buy that?’’ Jedlicka asked. Though the President claimed to have pledges from investors — sometimes he said $2 billion, other times $20 billion — the nation’s primary revenue stream was through merchandising, and he might have preferred to retain an incidental state monopoly for the time being, or at the very least tributary payments.\n‘‘Oh, I just printed it right off the Internet!’’\nAs the Mini exited the airport, the car filled with the banana-chocolate vape exhaust of Pillar, the Canadian-Slovak assistant. Pillar had almost been stranded in Osijek, because the President’s assistant in Prague, Kristyna Nedvedova, forgot to check him in for the flight in advance. (Nedvedova disputes this, claiming that the President continually fails to pass along the necessary information.)\nThe relationship among the President’s many assistants resembled his broader problem in his attempt to consolidate his power base: He sought strength in numbers, told people what they wanted to hear and figured that envy and disagreement would resolve themselves down the line.\nPillar puffed on his vape pen, and Picard took this as an opportunity to offer the passengers his own vape pen, which contained a solution of pure cannabis oil mixed with a lovely blueberry flavor. Picard told us that he used it to take the edge off a recent flight from Oslo; he had problems with the British government, in fact he owed them quite a bit of money, and he was nation-shopping. He liked Norway, but his ideal refuge would be a place like Liberland.\nJedlicka was trying to change the shared Google Calendar time of the London meeting on his phone, but his roaming data service was unreliable. Picard took his hands off the steering wheel to pick up his own phone to broadcast as a local 3G hot spot. Jedlicka asked for the password.\n‘‘O.K., the key phrase is, first p, as in ‘president,’ then a zero, then, uh, r, n as in Nancy, s, and the ending is t, a, r. That’s, uh, pornstar, but with a zero instead of the o.’’\nJedlicka looked up from his phone and gazed at Picard. At times it seemed clear that the President felt minor but nagging doubts about the personnel decisions he had made. His tendency was to reward alacrity. When he advertised, on Facebook, for a Czech assistant who spoke English, the first person to reply was Nedvedova, a college student in Birmingham. Unfortunately, she still had two weeks of the semester left before she could return to Prague. The President said he needed someone immediately. She left school early, which made a vivid impression on the energetic young President. He had found, however, that it was not always easy to get in touch with her. And there were the frequent airport check-in problems.\nStill, the President needed a local vizier, and Picard had driven very far through a good deal of traffic. ‘‘I will make you,’’ Jedlicka intoned, ‘‘the leader of Liberland in Great Britain.’’\n6. The Martins\nThe pub, along the high street in Hampstead, was upscale, the clientele smartly outfitted for a Friday evening. Picard dropped off Jedlicka and went to park the car. Pillar puffed on his banana-chocolate vape pen out front and began asking people if they had heard of Liberland. ‘‘No? Well, do you like paying taxes?’’\nThe President moved past him and into the pub, which he toured in a quick circle, his phone and battery brick held together to his ear. He took a seat at a table outside. His supporters were probably just late because of the traffic. After a time, the President was approached, with some trepidation, by two men in their mid-30s, with unlined faces, one of them with a conservative style of refined fauxhawk, the other bald. They were neatly kitted out for a night at a downtempo lounge. The one wearing the fauxhawk introduced himself as Martin. Martin asked the first question that the President is usually asked: How did he come to discover Liberland?\nJedlicka, still dazzled by the radiant vision of an integrated user-login platform-portal, was eager to engage his subjects on the concrete matter of the future, not on the country’s Wikipedia origin. ‘‘Oh, yes, we did research, we somehow came over this piece of land, and we said, ‘O.K., Let’s take it,’ ’’ he said. ‘‘The next day, the Serbian government released a statement saying, ‘We don’t mind it, but it’s a frivolous act.’ ’’ Jedlicka laughed. ‘‘What does that mean, ‘frivolous’ — like, of free will?’’\n‘‘Not really,’’ Martin began, but the President had already leapt ahead.\n‘‘It will be like a large grid, with a row for each nation, and it will show the tasks and the titles,’’ he said, explaining the color-coding system for proper task management. ‘‘It will be like a world collection of shadow governments, with a full Liberland cabinet in each place doing everything that needs to be done. Ambassador, photographer, videographer, P.R. guy.’’\nMartin pressed for details beyond the integrated Internet grid. ‘‘But how,’’ he asked, ‘‘are you going to do this? There’s a claim from other governments — ’’\nJedlicka cut him off. ‘‘No, there aren’t.’’ He said that Croatia could not sensibly claim the land on behalf of Serbia. ‘‘What Croatia did was recognize our borders by putting police there. That did more for us than the Serbians.’’ If everything went according to his plan, he added, ‘‘We will inhabit the land by the sixth of September.’’ It would be the President’s 32nd birthday.\nJedlicka had to check Facebook in case he was missing some supporters who hadn’t yet recognized him at the pub. This was supposed to be a meeting with his English patrons, but he had not seemed to register that Martin and his friend each had a slight Slavic accent.\nThey were from Poland, though they’d been in Britain for more than 10 years. They were software engineers with good jobs. They quite liked life in London but had been made anxious by the waxing anti-immigrant sentiment. They thought they had moved past the era, when Poland joined the European Union in 2004, of fears about the ‘‘Polish plumber’’ come to take away middle-class jobs. But once again immigrants were being scapegoated, and their future in the country was uncertain. They were interested in Liberland in part for the technological aspect and in part because they wanted to make themselves aware of any possible haven, should such anti-immigrant parties as UKIP come into real power. Like the Egyptians and the Syrians, they might become exactly the sort of political refugees the hard-line libertarians preferred to keep out of their country. The L.S.A. had, for example, firm positions on the matter of immigration; on their website they ran an interview with one member who implicitly spoke for the whole movement when he said, ‘‘I definitely wouldn’t like it if people came to Liberland just because there isn’t political freedom in their country.’’ But the President stood for a big-tent libertarianism and did not want to see the future of Liberland compromised by such small-stakes infighting.\nAn hour passed before another ally arrived, an overweight, bespectacled man in his 50s wearing a large blue polo. He introduced himself as Martin. He, too, had a Slavic accent. He was interested in Liberlandian citizenship, because he thought it would be an excellent site for a protected data center.\nThe first Slavic Martin asked where the second Slavic Martin was from. ‘‘Are you English?’’\n‘‘British,’’ the second Martin said.\n‘‘Really?’’\n‘‘From Kazakhstan.’’\nMartin from Kazakhstan waited for Jedlicka to be finished on Facebook before he told him, with childlike delight, that he had been one of his earliest and most ardent supporters. ‘‘Now you have 300,000 applications — ’’\n‘‘Three hundred thirty thousand,’’ the President corrected him.\n‘‘Now you have 330,000 applications, but when I registered on website it was only 200,000!’’\nThe President was quick to capitalize on Martin from Kazakhstan’s spirit. ‘‘I know,’’ he said. ‘‘When I sent out an email about this meeting, I sent it to only 100 people, and I put you on it.’’ The President looked around the pub. ‘‘And here we are seven. Seven percent turnout for the last minute. Not bad.’’\n7. The State Visit to France\nLiberland’s ambassador to France, Pierre-Louis Boitel, lives in Charenton, a large suburb southeast of Paris, with which it shares a border. Some status anxiety attaches to a residence there, but the ambassador had translated Ayn Rand and appeared proud to resist the herdlike mentality. The only club the ambassador wanted to be a part of was Liberland, whose exclusivity was something he cherished; he worried that it would be diluted by impure libertarians. He spent the entire car ride from Charles de Gaulle Airport explaining to the President that the chief challenge facing Liberland was the question of citizenship and that they would have to run it on a subscription basis as a very exclusive club. The ambassador was friends with a retired police officer who was willing to run background checks. He seemed in part to want an exclusive club because of his anxiety about where he lived. For most people, he explained outside the Embassy, ‘‘if you live in Charenton, you are nobody. You say you live in Paris, and someone says where, and you say, ‘Charenton,’ and they say, ‘Oh, then you do not live in Paris!’ But Paris is one hundred meters away, and we are on the Metro and here we pay 35 percent less than you pay to live in Paris.’’\nThe President worried on occasion that he was too promiscuous with his titling, a common affliction among young micronational commanders in chief seeking to bolster the ranks of the political class, but he still referred casually to Boitel’s apartment as the Embassy. The ambassador, a financial executive, was a lanky man of 39 in an oversize suit, with a long, pointy nose, a thick helmet of overbrushed brown hair and eyebrows whose animation seemed fitful and beyond his control. He showed Jedlicka into the Embassy, saying, ‘‘This is your Embassy, President, you are at home here.’’\nThe parlor room was done in a subdued baroque style. The walls were painted salmon pink and sea green; gilded Louis XV replica armchairs were reflected in gilded mirrors. Heavy teal curtains were pulled back to admit the hesitant afternoon light, which pooled on the pale herringbone wooden floors. The walls were hung with coarse pastoral and dock scenes in thickly knifed oils, and antique knickknacks were everywhere: daggers inlaid with mother-of-pearl, fragile ceramics, a music stand with the sheet music for ‘‘La Vie Parisienne.’’\nJedlicka had only a few minutes to update his presentation before the whole party had to leave for his keynote speech at the annual convention of the small French libertarian party, but first he needed time alone with the first lady, who had flown in from Prague for the event. The first lady, whom the President refers to exclusively as the first lady, has been the President’s girlfriend for a year and a half, and now she resides with him at the embassy in Prague. She is tall and well scrubbed and very blond; she keeps up an active lifestyle and maintains perfect posture even while seated. Though she did not get involved in her current relationship with the expectation of a full roster of official duties, she has taken on her new role with felicity and elegance. In order to labor on behalf of Liberland full time, she has temporarily given up her work as a massage therapist. The President treats the first lady with extraordinary consideration and solicitousness.\nOnce the President finished updating his presentation, the legation walked to the Metro. En route, he took out his phone. He would never be anything but unassuming about protocol, but he asked if there weren’t a method of transport that might be more commensurate with his office. There was, after all, a French camera crew trailing him, and it was important that he make the proper impression on the television of a country where he had such a key embassy. ‘‘It’s just not too presidential to travel by subway,’’ he said. ‘‘I’m going to call an Uber.’’\n‘‘No, no, you cannot,’’ the ambassador said. ‘‘It is not safe, it is impossible to take Uber here, you will not be safe. There is no time, and we must take the Metro. It will be quick. We do not even have to change the train.’’\nThe President relented. But he would draw the official line at being filmed carrying his own bag. Pillar, however, would not be arriving in Paris for another seven hours; the President’s assistant had once again failed to check him in, and he had been left at Heathrow.\nThe President turned to me with a look of anguish. He understood that this was a violation of propriety, but he also very strongly did not want to be filmed by French television carrying his own bag. I felt sorry for him and accepted a short tenure as his bag man.\nJedlicka was briefly mollified, but he was still very embarrassed to be seen on camera taking the Metro at all. Perhaps to compensate for the indignity, Boitel proceeded to cut a very long line of people to buy tickets, claiming that he was traveling on urgent official business.\nThe presentation, which began with a homage to the writings of the French proto-libertarian Frédéric Bastiat, was well attended, but the crowd was quick to disperse afterward. For the state dinner following the presentation, the ambassador had rented out an entire brasserie — all in crimson and gold — across from the Bourse, but more than 50 people who committed to coming weren’t there. The President told him that in the future, it would be best to have people pay in advance. The ambassador was frustrated. I tried to make small talk.\n‘‘I can’t tell you what I do or where I work, because my boss would immediately fire me,’’ the ambassador said. ‘‘I have a total, clean separation between my work and Liberland.’’ He drew his hand down in a sharp chop. ‘‘I work in financial services for a very important and well-known firm, and if it were discovered that I was serving as the French ambassador from Liberland, everyone would immediately think I was washing money.’’\nAcross the table from the President was a middle-aged consultant with wire-rimmed glasses and a perpetual Gallic pout. He had been observing with some amusement the voltage across the gap between Boitel and Jedlicka, as they had sparred over the question of citizenship. The consultant said something sharp in French, and for the first time the ambassador lost his restrained bearing entirely. His pale face became hot with blood, and he sputtered rapid responses across the table. The consultant remained cool and sipped his Bordeaux, saying very little as the ambassador railed. The word that kept coming up in his ripostes was ‘‘blanchiment’’ — ‘‘whitening,’’ or money laundering.\nThe ambassador decided to drop the matter and turned to his salmon, which required liberation from drowning in a pool of white butter.\nLater, the wife of the consultant, a petite Russian woman with red hair and tiny teeth, explained the dispute her husband had had with the ambassador. ‘‘Oh, the ambassador works at this bank’’ — she said the name — ‘‘and my husband told him that especially in the light of his job, everyone in France would view Liberland as a money-laundering scheme. That is how we view all of the other places the President likes to mention all the time: Liechtenstein, Monaco, Singapore. Those are all tax havens.’’\nOn the one hand, the President took it as a matter of common sense that high tax rates had put innovation and growth in government shackles everywhere on earth; on the other, the President really did believe that his young nation would be rooted in a like-minded community and would have taken as a great betrayal of his mission the idea that Liberland would only represent a virtual home for some collection of far-flung tax evaders, people who had nothing to do with one another beyond personal greed.\nThe ambassador was less interested about where the money was coming from than he was in its conversion to cryptocurrency. He advised the President at length about Bitcoin and Blockchain.\n‘‘The L.S.A., they are just not serious,’’ the ambassador said. ‘‘They have their shares in an Excel file. An Excel file! That is not serious.’’\nIt was not wholly clear to the President how his appointed ambassador knew this.\n‘‘Why, it is simple!’’ Boitel said. ‘‘I own shares!’’\n8. The President in America\nA month later the President and I met again, in the greenroom at the Midtown Manhattan radio studios of The Blaze, Glenn Beck’s network. In the intervening time, Jedlicka had been in intermittent touch, sending me an early MP3 of the national anthem — it was folksy and exhortative, like Joni Mitchell channeling the economist Milton Friedman — and telling me about his proliferating media coverage. I told him he looked good, but the reality was that he was clearly under some strain. The tips of his blond hair had lost their light magnesium frost. I asked after his new suit, and he told me he had gained more than six pounds.\nNew York was the last landing on Jedlicka’s tour. He and the first lady traveled first to Las Vegas, where he spoke at Beck’s annual FreedomFest convention and had the chance to shake the hand of Peter Thiel, a libertarian entrepreneur and venture capitalist. He wanted to play a dollar in one of the slot machines, but the first lady thought that gambling was beneath his station. The next stop was San Francisco; his Facebook post of the supporters’ dinner there remarked that, among the various techno-libertarians he had been courting, a young relative of Kafka had been present. In Washington, he was disappointed not to meet Rand Paul, but he had the chance to meet with representatives at the Cato Institute. Throughout his trip, he had set his Twitter feed to broadcast inspirational quotes from the history of American democracy.\nWhat vexed him most was the continuing recalcitrance of the Croatians. Not long before, on July 4, the President celebrated Liberlandian Independence Day. Croatia issued an official diplomatic statement once again, explaining that the territory identified as Liberland was not, in fact, terra nullius, and that they would continue to forcibly remove homesteaders. As if this weren’t humiliation enough, members of the L.S.A. had photographed Croatian citizens enjoying a summer frolic on the sandy beaches of Liberty Island. But he was as undeterred as ever. In just a week in America, Jedlicka managed to establish 10 consular offices around the country, and he was pleased to discover that the Croatians themselves had only four. (They actually have nine.) ‘‘It’s not a competition,’’ Jedlicka said, ‘‘but. ...’’ He trailed off with a grin.\nHe persisted in his belief that the Croatian border police were helping him through the de facto recognition of his borders. But, it seemed to me, it was helping him even more by barring him and his future citizens from actually settling the land. If the land were settled, it would become obvious to all that Liberland had courted an impossible coalition of fantasists. For some, it was a hedge against resurgent nationalism; for others, a bastion of euroskepticism. It was a haven for exiles and refugees and, at the same time, the promised land of the xenophobe and the techno-pirate. Jedlicka, so profligate with his sympathies, could sell a version of Liberland to tax reformers and another to Bitcoin traders. He could sell it just as well to a Pole in London as he could to a member of UKIP.\nThe huge-tent dissonance had even been designed into the Liberlandian flag itself, with its yellow, symbolizing voluntary exchange; the black, symbolizing rebellion against the system; and the tree, symbolizing abundance. The bird symbolized freedom, which in practical terms meant support for equal-opportunity disaffection. It was an unassailable social-media strategy in a time of worldwide resentment toward governance, and as long as Jedlicka did not have to govern the terrain of an actual country, it would continue to redound to his credit across the world.\nJedlicka was never more than five minutes away from Facebook, and from his tiny theoretical country, he spoke a plastic message of faith and empowerment. The elites in Brussels and the national capitals, both elected and unelected, had never seemed so haughty, distant and undemocratic. But he was tired. After so many interviews, the President had grown weary of repeating the things that should have been so obvious to anyone who loved freedom. He held his face in his hands on the couch in the green room — and then sat up and looked across at me with great intensity.\n‘‘Did I tell you about the idea I had on the flight, for a color-coded online matrix that would help all citizens get Liberlandian merits?’’\nI nodded.\n‘‘We have so many people in Prague working on it! We have made so much great progress!’’","[""Borders are typically defined and agreed upon by the governments of neighboring countries.""]",11535,15,0.11535000000000001,0.00045,0.11580000000000001
"SEATTLE — On Monday mornings, fresh recruits line up for an orientation intended to catapult them into Amazon’s singular way of working.\nThey are told to forget the “poor habits” they learned at previous jobs, one employee recalled. When they “hit the wall” from the unrelenting pace, there is only one solution: “Climb the wall,” others reported. To be the best Amazonians they can be, they should be guided by the leadership principles, 14 rules inscribed on handy laminated cards. When quizzed days later, those with perfect scores earn a virtual award proclaiming, “I’m Peculiar” — the company’s proud phrase for overturning workplace conventions.\nAt Amazon, workers are encouraged to tear apart one another’s ideas in meetings, toil long and late (emails arrive past midnight, followed by text messages asking why they were not answered), and held to standards that the company boasts are “unreasonably high.” The internal phone directory instructs colleagues on how to send secret feedback to one another’s bosses. Employees say it is frequently used to sabotage others. (The tool offers sample texts, including this: “I felt concerned about his inflexibility and openly complaining about minor tasks.”)\nMany of the newcomers filing in on Mondays may not be there in a few years. The company’s winners dream up innovations that they roll out to a quarter-billion customers and accrue small fortunes in soaring stock. Losers leave or are fired in annual cullings of the staff — “purposeful Darwinism,” one former Amazon human resources director said. Some workers who suffered from cancer, miscarriages and other personal crises said they had been evaluated unfairly or edged out rather than given time to recover.\nEven as the company tests delivery by drone and ways to restock toilet paper at the push of a bathroom button, it is conducting a little-known experiment in how far it can push white-collar workers, redrawing the boundaries of what is acceptable. The company, founded and still run by Jeff Bezos, rejects many of the popular management bromides that other corporations at least pay lip service to and has instead designed what many workers call an intricate machine propelling them to achieve Mr. Bezos’ ever-expanding ambitions.\n“This is a company that strives to do really big, innovative, groundbreaking things, and those things aren’t easy,” said Susan Harker, Amazon’s top recruiter. “When you’re shooting for the moon, the nature of the work is really challenging. For some people it doesn’t work.”\nBo Olson was one of them. He lasted less than two years in a book marketing role and said that his enduring image was watching people weep in the office, a sight other workers described as well. “You walk out of a conference room and you’ll see a grown man covering his face,” he said. “Nearly every person I worked with, I saw cry at their desk.”\nThanks in part to its ability to extract the most from employees, Amazon is stronger than ever. Its swelling campus is transforming a swath of this city, a 10-million-square-foot bet that tens of thousands of new workers will be able to sell everything to everyone everywhere. Last month, it eclipsed Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the country, with a market valuation of $250 billion, and Forbes deemed Mr. Bezos the fifth-wealthiest person on earth.\nTens of millions of Americans know Amazon as customers, but life inside its corporate offices is largely a mystery. Secrecy is required; even low-level employees sign a lengthy confidentiality agreement. The company authorized only a handful of senior managers to talk to reporters for this article, declining requests for interviews with Mr. Bezos and his top leaders.\nHowever, more than 100 current and former Amazonians — members of the leadership team, human resources executives, marketers, retail specialists and engineers who worked on projects from the Kindle to grocery delivery to the recent mobile phone launch — described how they tried to reconcile the sometimes-punishing aspects of their workplace with what many called its thrilling power to create.\nIn interviews, some said they thrived at Amazon precisely because it pushed them past what they thought were their limits. Many employees are motivated by “thinking big and knowing that we haven’t scratched the surface on what’s out there to invent,” said Elisabeth Rommel, a retail executive who was one of those permitted to speak.\nOthers who cycled in and out of the company said that what they learned in their brief stints helped their careers take off. And more than a few who fled said they later realized they had become addicted to Amazon’s way of working.\n“A lot of people who work there feel this tension: It’s the greatest place I hate to work,” said John Rossman, a former executive there who published a book, “The Amazon Way.”\nAmazon may be singular but perhaps not quite as peculiar as it claims. It has just been quicker in responding to changes that the rest of the work world is now experiencing: data that allows individual performance to be measured continuously, come-and-go relationships between employers and employees, and global competition in which empires rise and fall overnight. Amazon is in the vanguard of where technology wants to take the modern office: more nimble and more productive, but harsher and less forgiving.\n“Organizations are turning up the dial, pushing their teams to do more for less money, either to keep up with the competition or just stay ahead of the executioner’s blade,” said Clay Parker Jones, a consultant who helps old-line businesses become more responsive to change.\nOn a recent morning, as Amazon’s new hires waited to begin orientation, few of them seemed to appreciate the experiment in which they had enrolled. Only one, Keith Ketzle, a freckled Texan triathlete with an M.B.A., lit up with recognition, explaining how he left his old, lumbering company for a faster, grittier one.\n“Conflict brings about innovation,” he said.\nA Philosophy of Work\nJeff Bezos turned to data-driven management very early.\nHe wanted his grandmother to stop smoking, he recalled in a 2010 graduation speech at Princeton. He didn’t beg or appeal to sentiment. He just did the math, calculating that every puff cost her a few minutes. “You’ve taken nine years off your life!” he told her. She burst into tears.\nHe was 10 at the time. Decades later, he created a technological and retail giant by relying on some of the same impulses: eagerness to tell others how to behave; an instinct for bluntness bordering on confrontation; and an overarching confidence in the power of metrics, buoyed by his experience in the early 1990s at D. E. Shaw, a financial firm that overturned Wall Street convention by using algorithms to get the most out of every trade.\nAccording to early executives and employees, Mr. Bezos was determined almost from the moment he founded Amazon in 1994 to resist the forces he thought sapped businesses over time — bureaucracy, profligate spending, lack of rigor. As the company grew, he wanted to codify his ideas about the workplace, some of them proudly counterintuitive, into instructions simple enough for a new worker to understand, general enough to apply to the nearly limitless number of businesses he wanted to enter and stringent enough to stave off the mediocrity he feared.\nThe result was the leadership principles, the articles of faith that describe the way Amazonians should act. In contrast to companies where declarations about their philosophy amount to vague platitudes, Amazon has rules that are part of its daily language and rituals, used in hiring, cited at meetings and quoted in food-truck lines at lunchtime. Some Amazonians say they teach them to their children.\nThe guidelines conjure an empire of elite workers (principle No. 5: “Hire and develop the best”) who hold one another to towering expectations and are liberated from the forces — red tape, office politics — that keep them from delivering their utmost. Employees are to exhibit “ownership” (No. 2), or mastery of every element of their businesses, and “dive deep,” (No. 12) or find the underlying ideas that can fix problems or identify new services before shoppers even ask for them.\nThe workplace should be infused with transparency and precision about who is really achieving and who is not. Within Amazon, ideal employees are often described as “athletes” with endurance, speed (No. 8: “bias for action”), performance that can be measured and an ability to defy limits (No. 7: “think big”).\n“You can work long, hard or smart, but at Amazon.com you can’t choose two out of three,” Mr. Bezos wrote in his 1997 letter to shareholders, when the company sold only books, and which still serves as a manifesto. He added that when he interviewed potential hires, he warned them, “It’s not easy to work here.”\nMr. Rossman, the former executive, said that Mr. Bezos was addressing a meeting in 2003 when he turned in the direction of Microsoft, across the water from Seattle, and said he didn’t want Amazon to become “a country club.” If Amazon becomes like Microsoft, “we would die,” Mr. Bezos added.\nWhile the Amazon campus appears similar to those of some tech giants — with its dog-friendly offices, work force that skews young and male, on-site farmers’ market and upbeat posters — the company is considered a place apart. Google and Facebook motivate employees with gyms, meals and benefits, like cash handouts for new parents, “designed to take care of the whole you,” as Google puts it.\nAmazon, though, offers no pretense that catering to employees is a priority. Compensation is considered competitive — successful midlevel managers can collect the equivalent of an extra salary from grants of a stock that has increased more than tenfold since 2008. But workers are expected to embrace “frugality” (No. 9), from the bare-bones desks to the cellphones and travel expenses that they often pay themselves. (No daily free food buffets or regular snack supplies, either.) The focus is on relentless striving to please customers, or “customer obsession” (No. 1), with words like “mission” used to describe lightning-quick delivery of Cocoa Krispies or selfie sticks.\nAs the company has grown, Mr. Bezos has become more committed to his original ideas, viewing them in almost moral terms, those who have worked closely with him say. “My main job today: I work hard at helping to maintain the culture,” Mr. Bezos said last year at a conference run by Business Insider, a web publication in which he is an investor.\nOf all of his management notions, perhaps the most distinctive is his belief that harmony is often overvalued in the workplace — that it can stifle honest critique and encourage polite praise for flawed ideas. Instead, Amazonians are instructed to “disagree and commit” (No. 13) — to rip into colleagues’ ideas, with feedback that can be blunt to the point of painful, before lining up behind a decision.\n“We always want to arrive at the right answer,” said Tony Galbato, vice president for human resources, in an email statement. “It would certainly be much easier and socially cohesive to just compromise and not debate, but that may lead to the wrong decision.”\nAt its best, some employees said, Amazon can feel like the Bezos vision come to life, a place willing to embrace risk and strengthen ideas by stress test. Employees often say their co-workers are the sharpest, most committed colleagues they have ever met, taking to heart instructions in the leadership principles like “never settle” and “no task is beneath them.” Even relatively junior employees can make major contributions. The new delivery-by-drone project announced in 2013, for example, was coinvented by a low-level engineer named Daniel Buchmueller.\nLast August, Stephenie Landry, an operations executive, joined in discussions about how to shorten delivery times and developed an idea for rushing goods to urban customers in an hour or less. One hundred eleven days later, she was in Brooklyn directing the start of the new service, Prime Now.\n“A customer was able to get an Elsa doll that they could not find in all of New York City, and they had it delivered to their house in 23 minutes,” said Ms. Landry, who was authorized by the company to speak, still sounding exhilarated months later about providing “Frozen” dolls in record time.\nThat becomes possible, she and others said, when everyone follows the dictates of the leadership principles. “We’re trying to create those moments for customers where we’re solving a really practical need,” Ms. Landry said, “in this way that feels really futuristic and magical.”\nMotivating the ‘Amabots’\nCompany veterans often say the genius of Amazon is the way it drives them to drive themselves. “If you’re a good Amazonian, you become an Amabot,” said one employee, using a term that means you have become at one with the system.\nIn Amazon warehouses, employees are monitored by sophisticated electronic systems to ensure they are packing enough boxes every hour. (Amazon came under fire in 2011 when workers in an eastern Pennsylvania warehouse toiled in more than 100-degree heat with ambulances waiting outside, taking away laborers as they fell. After an investigation by the local newspaper, the company installed air-conditioning.)\nBut in its offices, Amazon uses a self-reinforcing set of management, data and psychological tools to spur its tens of thousands of white-collar employees to do more and more. “The company is running a continual performance improvement algorithm on its staff,” said Amy Michaels, a former Kindle marketer.\nThe process begins when Amazon’s legions of recruiters identify thousands of job prospects each year, who face extra screening by “bar raisers,” star employees and part-time interviewers charged with ensuring that only the best are hired. As the newcomers acclimate, they often feel dazzled, flattered and intimidated by how much responsibility the company puts on their shoulders and how directly Amazon links their performance to the success of their assigned projects, whether selling wine or testing the delivery of packages straight to shoppers’ car trunks.\nEvery aspect of the Amazon system amplifies the others to motivate and discipline the company’s marketers, engineers and finance specialists: the leadership principles; rigorous, continuing feedback on performance; and the competition among peers who fear missing a potential problem or improvement and race to answer an email before anyone else.\nSome veterans interviewed said they were protected from pressures by nurturing bosses or worked in relatively slow divisions. But many others said the culture stoked their willingness to erode work-life boundaries, castigate themselves for shortcomings (being “vocally self-critical” is included in the description of the leadership principles) and try to impress a company that can often feel like an insatiable taskmaster. Even many Amazonians who have worked on Wall Street and at start-ups say the workloads at the new South Lake Union campus can be extreme: marathon conference calls on Easter Sunday and Thanksgiving, criticism from bosses for spotty Internet access on vacation, and hours spent working at home most nights or weekends.\n“One time I didn’t sleep for four days straight,” said Dina Vaccari, who joined in 2008 to sell Amazon gift cards to other companies and once used her own money, without asking for approval, to pay a freelancer in India to enter data so she could get more done. “These businesses were my babies, and I did whatever I could to make them successful.”\nShe and other workers had no shortage of career options but said they had internalized Amazon’s priorities. One ex-employee’s fiancé became so concerned about her nonstop working night after night that he would drive to the Amazon campus at 10 p.m. and dial her cellphone until she agreed to come home. When they took a vacation to Florida, she spent every day at Starbucks using the wireless connection to get work done.\n“That’s when the ulcer started,” she said. (Like several other former workers, the woman requested that her name not be used because her current company does business with Amazon. Some current employees were reluctant to be identified because they were barred from speaking with reporters.)\nTo prod employees, Amazon has a powerful lever: more data than any retail operation in history. Its perpetual flow of real-time, ultradetailed metrics allows the company to measure nearly everything its customers do: what they put in their shopping carts, but do not buy; when readers reach the “abandon point” in a Kindle book; and what they will stream based on previous purchases. It can also tell when engineers are not building pages that load quickly enough, or when a vendor manager does not have enough gardening gloves in stock.\n“Data creates a lot of clarity around decision-making,” said Sean Boyle, who runs the finance division of Amazon Web Services and was permitted by the company to speak. “Data is incredibly liberating.”\nAmazon employees are held accountable for a staggering array of metrics, a process that unfolds in what can be anxiety-provoking sessions called business reviews, held weekly or monthly among various teams. A day or two before the meetings, employees receive printouts, sometimes up to 50 or 60 pages long, several workers said. At the reviews, employees are cold-called and pop-quizzed on any one of those thousands of numbers.\nExplanations like “we’re not totally sure” or “I’ll get back to you” are not acceptable, many employees said. Some managers sometimes dismissed such responses as “stupid” or told workers to “just stop it.” The toughest questions are often about getting to the bottom of “cold pricklies,” or email notifications that inform shoppers that their goods won’t arrive when promised — the opposite of the “warm fuzzy” sensation of consumer satisfaction.\nThe sessions crowd out other work, many workers complain. But they also say that is part of the point: The meetings force them to absorb the metrics of their business, their minds swimming with details.\n“Once you know something isn’t as good as it could be, why wouldn’t you want to fix it?” said Julie Todaro, who led some of Amazon’s largest retail categories.\nEmployees talk of feeling how their work is never done or good enough. One Amazon building complex is named Day 1, a reminder from Mr. Bezos that it is only the beginning of a new era of commerce, with much more to accomplish.\nIn 2012, Chris Brucia, who was working on a new fashion sale site, received a punishing performance review from his boss, a half-hour lecture on every goal he had not fulfilled and every skill he had not yet mastered. Mr. Brucia silently absorbed the criticism, fearing he was about to be managed out, wondering how he would tell his wife.\n“Congratulations, you’re being promoted,” his boss finished, leaning in for a hug that Mr. Brucia said he was too shocked to return.\nNoelle Barnes, who worked in marketing for Amazon for nine years, repeated a saying around campus: “Amazon is where overachievers go to feel bad about themselves.”\nA Running Competition\nIn 2013, Elizabeth Willet, a former Army captain who served in Iraq, joined Amazon to manage housewares vendors and was thrilled to find that a large company could feel so energetic and entrepreneurial. After she had a child, she arranged with her boss to be in the office from 7 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. each day, pick up her baby and often return to her laptop later. Her boss assured her things were going well, but her colleagues, who did not see how early she arrived, sent him negative feedback accusing her of leaving too soon.\n“I can’t stand here and defend you if your peers are saying you’re not doing your work,” she says he told her. She left the company after a little more than a year.\nMs. Willet’s co-workers strafed her through the Anytime Feedback Tool, the widget in the company directory that allows employees to send praise or criticism about colleagues to management. (While bosses know who sends the comments, their identities are not typically shared with the subjects of the remarks.) Because team members are ranked, and those at the bottom eliminated every year, it is in everyone’s interest to outperform everyone else.\nCraig Berman, an Amazon spokesman, said the tool was just another way to provide feedback, like sending an email or walking into a manager’s office. Most comments, he said, are positive.\nHowever, many workers called it a river of intrigue and scheming. They described making quiet pacts with colleagues to bury the same person at once, or to praise one another lavishly. Many others, along with Ms. Willet, described feeling sabotaged by negative comments from unidentified colleagues with whom they could not argue. In some cases, the criticism was copied directly into their performance reviews — a move that Amy Michaels, the former Kindle manager, said that colleagues called “the full paste.”\nSoon the tool, or something close, may be found in many more offices. Workday, a human resources software company, makes a similar product called Collaborative Anytime Feedback that promises to turn the annual performance review into a daily event. One of the early backers of Workday was Jeff Bezos, in one of his many investments. (He also owns The Washington Post.)\nThe rivalries at Amazon extend beyond behind-the-back comments. Employees say that the Bezos ideal, a meritocracy in which people and ideas compete and the best win, where co-workers challenge one another “even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting,” as the leadership principles note, has turned into a world of frequent combat.\nResources are sometimes hoarded. That includes promising job candidates, who are especially precious at a company with a high number of open positions. To get new team members, one veteran said, sometimes “you drown someone in the deep end of the pool,” then take his or her subordinates. Ideas are critiqued so harshly in meetings at times that some workers fear speaking up.\nDavid Loftesness, a senior developer, said he admired the customer focus but could not tolerate the hostile language used in many meetings, a comment echoed by many others.\nFor years, he and his team devoted themselves to improving the search capabilities of Amazon’s website — only to discover that Mr. Bezos had greenlighted a secret competing effort to build an alternate technology. “I’m not going to be the kind of person who can work in this environment,” he said he concluded. He went on to become a director of engineering at Twitter.\nEach year, the internal competition culminates at an extended semi-open tournament called an Organization Level Review, where managers debate subordinates’ rankings, assigning and reassigning names to boxes in a matrix projected on the wall. In recent years, other large companies, including Microsoft, General Electric and Accenture Consulting, have dropped the practice — often called stack ranking, or “rank and yank” — in part because it can force managers to get rid of valuable talent just to meet quotas.\nThe review meeting starts with a discussion of the lower-level employees, whose performance is debated in front of higher-level managers. As the hours pass, successive rounds of managers leave the room, knowing that those who remain will determine their fates.\nPreparing is like getting ready for a court case, many supervisors say: To avoid losing good members of their teams — which could spell doom — they must come armed with paper trails to defend the wrongfully accused and incriminate members of competing groups. Or they adopt a strategy of choosing sacrificial lambs to protect more essential players. “You learn how to diplomatically throw people under the bus,” said a marketer who spent six years in the retail division. “It’s a horrible feeling.”\nMr. Galbato, the human resources executive, explained the company’s reasoning for the annual staff paring. “We hire a lot of great people,” he said in an email, “but we don’t always get it right.”\nDick Finnegan, a consultant who advises companies on how to retain employees, warns of the costs of mandatory cuts. “If you can build an organization with zero deadwood, why wouldn’t you do it?” he asked. “But I don’t know how sustainable it is. You’d have to have a never-ending two-mile line around the block of very qualified people who want to work for you.”\nMany women at Amazon attribute its gender gap — unlike Facebook, Google or Walmart, it does not currently have a single woman on its top leadership team — to its competition-and-elimination system. Several former high-level female executives, and other women participating in a recent internal Amazon online discussion that was shared with The New York Times, said they believed that some of the leadership principles worked to their disadvantage. They said they could lose out in promotions because of intangible criteria like “earn trust” (principle No. 10) or the emphasis on disagreeing with colleagues. Being too forceful, they said, can be particularly hazardous for women in the workplace.\nMotherhood can also be a liability. Michelle Williamson, a 41-year-old parent of three who helped build Amazon’s restaurant supply business, said her boss, Shahrul Ladue, had told her that raising children would most likely prevent her from success at a higher level because of the long hours required. Mr. Ladue, who confirmed her account, said that Ms. Williamson had been directly competing with younger colleagues with fewer commitments, so he suggested she find a less demanding job at Amazon. (Both he and Ms. Williamson left the company.)\nHe added that he usually worked 85 or more hours a week and rarely took a vacation.\nWhen ‘All’ Isn’t Good Enough\nMolly Jay, an early member of the Kindle team, said she received high ratings for years. But when she began traveling to care for her father, who was suffering from cancer, and cut back working on nights and weekends, her status changed. She was blocked from transferring to a less pressure-filled job, she said, and her boss told her she was “a problem.” As her father was dying, she took unpaid leave to care for him and never returned to Amazon.\n“When you’re not able to give your absolute all, 80 hours a week, they see it as a major weakness,” she said.\nA woman who had thyroid cancer was given a low performance rating after she returned from treatment. She says her manager explained that while she was out, her peers were accomplishing a great deal. Another employee who miscarried twins left for a business trip the day after she had surgery. “I’m sorry, the work is still going to need to get done,” she said her boss told her. “From where you are in life, trying to start a family, I don’t know if this is the right place for you.”\nA woman who had breast cancer was told that she was put on a “performance improvement plan” — Amazon code for “you’re in danger of being fired” — because “difficulties” in her “personal life” had interfered with fulfilling her work goals. Their accounts echoed others from workers who had suffered health crises and felt they had also been judged harshly instead of being given time to recover.\nA former human resources executive said she was required to put a woman who had recently returned after undergoing serious surgery, and another who had just had a stillborn child, on performance improvement plans, accounts that were corroborated by a co-worker still at Amazon. “What kind of company do we want to be?” the executive recalled asking her bosses.\nThe mother of the stillborn child soon left Amazon. “I had just experienced the most devastating event in my life,” the woman recalled via email, only to be told her performance would be monitored “to make sure my focus stayed on my job.”\nMr. Berman, the spokesman, said such responses to employees’ crises were “not our policy or practice.” He added, “If we were to become aware of anything like that, we would take swift action to correct it.” Amazon also made Ms. Harker, the top recruiter, available to describe the leadership team’s strong support over the last two years as her husband battled a rare cancer. “It took my breath away,” she said.\nSeveral employment lawyers in the Seattle area said they got regular calls from Amazon workers complaining of unfair treatment, including those who said they had been pushed out for “not being sufficiently devoted to the company,” said Michael Subit. But that is not a basis for a suit by itself, he said. “Unfairness is not illegal,” echoed Sara Amies, another lawyer. Without clear evidence of discrimination, it is difficult to win a suit based on a negative evaluation, she said.\nFor all of the employees who are edged out, many others flee, exhausted or unwilling to further endure the hardships for the cause of delivering swim goggles and rolls of Scotch tape to customers just a little quicker.\nJason Merkoski, 42, an engineer, worked on the team developing the first Kindle e-reader and served as a technology evangelist for Amazon, traveling the world to learn how people used the technology so it could be improved. He left Amazon in 2010 and then returned briefly in 2014.\n“The sheer number of innovations means things go wrong, you need to rectify, and then explain, and heaven help if you got an email from Jeff,” he said. “It’s as if you’ve got the C.E.O. of the company in bed with you at 3 a.m. breathing down your neck.”\nA Stream of Departures\nAmazon retains new workers in part by requiring them to repay a part of their signing bonus if they leave within a year, and a portion of their hefty relocation fees if they leave within two years. Several fathers said they left or were considering quitting because of pressure from bosses or peers to spend less time with their families. (Many tech companies are racing to top one another’s family leave policies — Netflix just began offering up to a year of paid parental leave. Amazon, though, offers no paid paternity leave.)\nIn interviews, 40-year-old men were convinced Amazon would replace them with 30-year-olds who could put in more hours, and 30-year-olds were sure that the company preferred to hire 20-somethings who would outwork them. After Max Shipley, a father of two young children, left this spring, he wondered if Amazon would “bring in college kids who have fewer commitments, who are single, who have more time to focus on work.” Mr. Shipley is 25.\nAmazon insists its reputation for high attrition is misleading. A 2013 survey by PayScale, a salary analysis firm, put the median employee tenure at one year, among the briefest in the Fortune 500. Amazon officials insisted tenure was low because hiring was so robust, adding that only 15 percent of employees had been at the company more than five years. Turnover is consistent with others in the technology industry, they said, but declined to disclose any data.\nEmployees, human resources executives and recruiters describe a steady exodus. “The pattern of burn and churn at Amazon, resulting in a disproportionate number of candidates from Amazon showing at our doorstep, is clear and consistent,” Nimrod Hoofien, a director of engineering at Facebook and an Amazon veteran, said in a recent Facebook post.\nThose departures are not a failure of the system, many current and former employees say, but rather the logical conclusion: mass intake of new workers, who help the Amazon machine spin and then wear out, leaving the most committed Amazonians to survive.\n“Purposeful Darwinism,” Robin Andrulevich, a former top Amazon human resources executive who helped draft the Leadership Principles, posted in reply to Mr. Hoofien’s comment. “They never could have done what they’ve accomplished without that,” she said in an interview, referring to Amazon’s cycle of constantly hiring employees, driving them and cutting them.\n“Amazon is O.K. with moving through a lot of people to identify and retain superstars,” said Vijay Ravindran, who worked at the retailer for seven years, the last two as the manager overseeing the checkout technology. “They keep the stars by offering a combination of incredible opportunities and incredible compensation. It’s like panning for gold.”\nThe employees who stream from the Amazon exits are highly desirable because of their work ethic, local recruiters say. In recent years, companies like Facebook have opened large Seattle offices, and they benefit from the Amazon outflow.\nRecruiters, though, also say that other businesses are sometimes cautious about bringing in Amazon workers, because they have been trained to be so combative. The derisive local nickname for Amazon employees is “Amholes” — pugnacious and work-obsessed.\nCall them what you will, their ranks are rapidly increasing. Amazon is finishing a 37-floor office tower near its South Lake Union campus and building another tower next to it. It plans a third next to that and has space for two more high-rises. By the time the dust settles in three years, Amazon will have enough space for 50,000 employees or so, more than triple what it had as recently as 2013.\nThose new workers will strive to make Amazon the first trillion-dollar retailer, in the hope that just about everyone will be watching Amazon movies and playing Amazon games on Amazon tablets while they tell their Amazon Echo communications device that they need an Amazon-approved plumber and new lawn chairs, and throw in some Amazon potato chips as well.\nMaybe it will happen. Liz Pearce spent two years at Amazon, managing projects like its wedding registry. “The pressure to deliver far surpasses any other metric,” she said. “I would see people practically combust.”\nBut just as Jeff Bezos was able to see the future of e-commerce before anyone else, she added, he was able to envision a new kind of workplace: fluid but tough, with employees staying only a short time and employers demanding the maximum.\n“Amazon is driven by data,” said Ms. Pearce, who now runs her own Seattle software company, which is well stocked with ex-Amazonians. “It will only change if the data says it must — when the entire way of hiring and working and firing stops making economic sense.”\nThe retailer is already showing some strain from its rapid growth. Even for entry-level jobs, it is hiring on the East Coast, and many employees are required to hand over all their contacts to company recruiters at “LinkedIn” parties. In Seattle alone, more than 4,500 jobs are open, including one for an analyst specializing in “high-volume hiring.”\nSome companies, faced with such an overwhelming need for new bodies, might scale back their ambitions or soften their message.\nNot Amazon. In a recent recruiting video, one young woman warns: “You either fit here or you don’t. You love it or you don’t. There is no middle ground.”\nAn article on Sunday about the workplace culture at Amazon.com erroneously included a company among those that have opened offices in Seattle and that benefit from the outflow of workers from Amazon. Facebook has done so, but LinkedIn has not.","[""Employees are expected to embrace 'frugality'.""]",7467,12,0.07467,0.00035999999999999997,0.07503
"WHITE HILLS, Ariz. — Antonio Nárdiz, a Spanish tourist from Bilbao, said he had chosen a family vacation to America for one specific reason: to fulfill his sons’ dreams of firing real machine guns. In Spain, he noted, 10-year-old Jon and 12-year-old Toni, like all other civilians, are forbidden to use automatic weapons.\nMr. Nárdiz, 47, had heard that a family trip to an American gun range turned tragic last year when a 9-year-old girl lost control of an Uzi submachine gun, killing her instructor. So when Mr. Nárdiz selected that same range for his family’s adventure — a place called Last Stop, just an hour’s drive from Las Vegas — he called ahead to ask about security. Someone told him, “It’s practically impossible for an accident to occur,” he said.\nIn the year since a New Jersey girl visited Last Stop and accidentally killed Charles Vacca, a 39-year-old father of four, little has changed in the nation’s tourist-oriented machine gun ranges. Last Stop’s range, which receives 100 to 200 visitors a week, is one of about a dozen places in the Las Vegas area that offer machine gun adventures.\n“I promised that one day I would bring them to fire guns,” Mr. Nárdiz said just after his children had used automatic weapons to pound bullets into a dirt-packed berm. “So I looked on the Internet, and I found this place. Everyone spoke very highly of it. And the truth is that it’s fantastic.”\nMr. Vacca’s death on Aug. 25 prompted a brief but impassioned conversation: Should Arizona and other states continue to allow children to fire automatic weapons? A video of the girl and the gun in the moments before Mr. Vacca’s death — she wore pink shorts and a ponytail — helped fuel the debate.\nThis summer, the owner of Last Stop placed the blame squarely on his employee, saying that while Mr. Vacca had been a beloved instructor, he had died because he broke a company rule by standing next to the girl, not behind her. The power of the gun in the hands of a preteen, the owner said, was not to blame.\n“We operate at the highest — a higher level of safety than most of the gun ranges I’ve visited all over the world,” said the owner, Sam Scarmardo, 63. Since Mr. Vacca’s death, he said, “there really wasn’t an awful lot of safety improvement.”\nWorkers at several Las Vegas ranges said they still allowed children to shoot, noting that they had long worked with young people and were well equipped to do so. The Range 702 in Las Vegas, for example, allows people ages 10 and up to shoot and has benches that instructors can adjust to different heights.\nLast Stop is a gas station and burger joint near the Nevada border. Mr. Scarmardo added the range in 2013, and it is associated with a company called Bullets and Burgers that picks up families and party groups at Las Vegas hotels and brings them here to shoot guns and then enjoy a hamburger and a beer. The company promises visitors a “Desert Storm atmosphere” and the opportunity to shoot “the actual firearms” used in movies like “Rambo: First Blood Part II.”\nTo many visitors, the experience is as quintessentially American as a roller-coaster ride at Disney World or a boat tour at Niagara Falls.\n“This is the American dream, right?” said Daniel Calvo, 31, a Spanish tourist who had just sent a burst of bullets flying as five friends in flip-flops and shorts cheered him on. “The guns, the trip to the Grand Canyon, the trip to Las Vegas.”\nAfter Mr. Vacca’s death, a sheriff’s investigation ruled the killing an accident, and an inspection of the range by the Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health found only violations it deemed minor, like failing to train an employee in the safe use of work-related chemicals.\nMr. Scarmardo said he had decided after the accident to raise the age requirement for shooting to 12, from 9, though employees are allowed to waive that rule when they deem a child large and mature enough to handle a powerful weapon.\n“If you’ve got a kid who is five feet tall and as mature as a 25-year-old, he can shoot,” Mr. Scarmardo said.\nHe added that children were typically restricted to using M16s or belt-fed guns that rest on a table or other surface, though a range employee later said he was unaware of that rule.\nNearly all instructors have military experience and receive two weeks of training before they can assist clients. Tourists receive a safety briefing of five to 10 minutes before they pull a trigger.\nAfter Mr. Vacca’s death, legislators in at least two states, Arizona and Louisiana, tried to pass laws that would have set a minimum age for handling an automatic weapon. Both efforts failed. State Representative Victoria Steele, a Democrat who proposed the Arizona bill, said her colleagues would not consider supporting a bill that restricted gun use, fearing a backlash from the National Rifle Association.\nTwenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have laws that restrict firearm use by children in some way, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\nIn the days after Mr. Vacca’s death, his children released a video in which they forgave the girl, who had come here with her parents and brother. In their first statement since the video, the children — Ashley, 20, Elizabeth, 16, Tylor, 15, and Christopher, 12 — said through lawyers that they wanted legislation that would set age minimums for using automatic weapons.\n“They say over and over again: We don’t want this to happen again,” said Marc Lamber, a lawyer for the Vacca family. “What do we need to do to stop this from happening again?”\nThe family has decided not to sue the range or the girl, he said, choosing to focus on changing the law. “Children shouldn’t be firing automatic weapons,” Mr. Lamber added. “It’s just a matter of common sense.” The parents of the girl, identified by police as the MacLachlans, declined to comment.\nOn a recent weekday, Mr. Calvo, one of the Spanish tourists, was surprised to learn from a reporter that Last Stop was the scene of the killing he had heard about last year. One of his friends, Samuel Pueyo, 29, said: “Shooting is fine as an experience, but for adults — not for children. It’s not ethical for a child.”\nBut Mr. Nárdiz said he felt very safe, and his children, Jon and Toni, agreed.\n“Oh, my God,” Jon said, rattling off the names of the guns he had fired: the MP5, the M4. “At the beginning it was a little scary, but it was so much fun.”","[""Children shouldn't be firing automatic weapons.""]",1582,9,0.01582,0.00026999999999999995,0.01609
"On a bright summer’s day at the Bronx Zoo, four adult female gorillas nursed their babies until the little gorillas were so full of mother’s milk, they fell asleep in the hot afternoon sun. In the distance, on a hill, a 5-foot-tall, 505-pound male silverback named Ernie gazed out over it all, chewing on a celery stalk.\nErnie is 32 and has been around. Born in the Oklahoma City Zoo, he lived in Colorado Springs and Knoxville, Tenn., before arriving in the Bronx on May 25, 2010, shipped in a large crate via FedEx overnight express.\nWhen zookeepers describe Ernie, they use words like “cautious,” “gentle,” “patient” and “excellent father.”\nIs he also loving? Certainly he knows what he’s doing, having sired four babies who were born to his mates in the last 18 months.\nBut does Ernie love the five adult female gorillas in his troop? Or is he only in it for the sex?\n“I personally wouldn’t use the word ‘love’ to describe the relationship,” said Patrick Thomas, the general curator of the Wildlife Conservation Society, which runs the zoo. When discussing the zoo’s western lowland gorilla troop, Dr. Thomas talks of “procreation” and “propagation.”\nOn the other hand Carl Safina, during a recent walk around the zoo, spoke of gorilla love. He is an ecologist, a winner of a MacArthur award and author of the recent book “Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel.” As far as he’s concerned, gorillas like Ernie and his five female companions feel the same thing in their chest cavities that humans do: the ache of a lovesick heart.\nMr. Safina attributes that special feeling to oxytocin.\n“We have the same brain chemicals that create mood and motivation in all vertebrates,” he said. “The only logical conclusion is that their experience is similar.”\nWhether it is love or hormones, most visitors to the zoo’s Congo Gorilla Forest do not have a clue how many conference calls, committee meetings, Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations it takes to produce a healthy relationship between two gorillas.\nIn the United States, all gorillas are conceived of in Cleveland, or at least that is where the chairwoman of the Gorilla Species Survival Plan of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums is based. The plan involves zookeepers from around the country who meet regularly to oversee the breeding plans for the 353 gorillas currently inhabiting 51 American zoos.\nAt these meetings, the first step to assembling a new troop is making sure the gorillas will be a good genetic match and thus avoid the sort of inbreeding that helped bring down the Hapsburg Empire.\nA gorilla’s personality, sexual experience and behavioral patterns are also factored in.\nErnie, whose stud registry number is 808, was born at the Oklahoma City Zoo on Dec. 7, 1982, to Moemba, No. 144, and Kathryn, No. 140. He comes from strong genetic stock; his mother lived to the age of 50, quite old for a gorilla. Both parents were born in the wild in the early 1960s, at a time when gorillas were still taken from their natural habitats.\nBecause gorillas live in troops, it is not just a matter of a male gorilla’s bonding with a particular female. In Ernie’s case, he has to be able to get along with Julia, Layla, Tuti, Kumi and Suki. And as anyone who has ever been married to even one person knows, trying to stay married to five primates — good luck with that.\nLooking for love in New York is not for the meek. “If it’s a young male gorilla that was raised in a very small troop, bringing him to the Bronx, where he’s going to be exposed to four or five adult females, might not be in his best interest,” Dr. Thomas said. “You wouldn’t want to introduce a sexually naïve male that hasn’t had a lot of experience with courtship behavior.” (The human equivalent would be trying to match up an Eagle Scout with Madonna.)\nOnce members of the species survival committee are confident they have a good genetic and behavioral match, they will give the go-ahead for transferring the gorilla to a new zoo.\nAbout a year ago, officials at the Bronx Zoo assembled a second troop consisting of a male silverback and four females. But, according to Dr. Thomas, the male’s relationship with the others is still shaky, so the troop has yet to appear in public. “It’s easier on him if we can do it in a quieter, off-exhibit area,” Dr. Thomas said. “We can keep an eye on how things are progressing.”\nTo avoid overpopulation, Bronx zookeepers must wait for a sign from Cleveland to let the baby-making begin. Until then, the females are given a reversible oral contraceptive.\nMr. Safina, who is a professor at Stony Brook University, has traveled the world observing animals in the wild, including elephants, dolphins, wolves and albatrosses, and says the more he sees, the more he is convinced that many animals experience love in the same way humans do.\nWolves are a particular passion.\n“Wolves will spend a lot of energy trying to attract a specific wolf, and they form a bond that will last all their lives,” he said. “I’ve never heard of a wolf abandoning his children. They appear to have relationships more durable than humans who have divorce.”\nLions, not so much.\nDr. Thomas says that when a new coalition of male lions takes control of a pride, the first thing they will try to do is kill all the young cubs that are still nursing.\n“They’re eliminating a competitor’s genes from making it into the future,” he says. “But also it causes a cub’s mother to come back into estrus so that the new male can breed with the females sooner.”\nAs for elephants, the Temptations’ classic “Papa Was a Rolling Stone” applies.\n“The female is receptive for four days every four years,” Mr. Safina says. “The male chases around the female, who runs away, but wants to be caught. They run side by side and eventually he lays his trunk along her back, as if they were playing tag. Once he does that, she stops, adopts a receptive position and the male mounts her.”\nIn less than a minute, he’s done, and skulks off into the brush in search of another female who is willing to spend a minute with him.\n“They just look for females in estrus, mate with them, and that’s all they have to do with the females and the babies,” Mr. Safina said.\nOf course there are plenty of men who behave like elephants. “There’s sex without bonding in humans and other animals,” he said. “Is there any romance in a one-night stand? Well yes, some, but it’s not very high quality, very deep or long lasting.”\nLions and elephants make male gorillas look like family men. Ernie plays with his babies, and can stop a young gorilla from too much roughhousing just by arching his sagittal crest. The male gorilla will protect the troop if it is threatened, and because female gorillas will leave if they are unhappy, Ernie has an incentive to behave himself.\nDuring Mr. Safina’s tour that day, there was very little contact between the sexes. Two male baboons were eating ticks and bugs off each other’s backs. The big cats paced, alone. Two radiated turtles touched noses, but that was all.\nAnd Ernie spent the afternoon behind a rock, out of sight. Asked what it all meant, Mr. Safina looked stymied, but only for a moment. “It would suggest romantic love is a very rare thing,” he said.","[""Gorillas live in troops.""]",1805,8,0.01805,0.00024,0.01829
"WASHINGTON — The National Labor Relations Board, in a long-awaited ruling, made it easier on Thursday for unions to negotiate on behalf of workers at fast-food chains and other companies relying on contractors and franchisees.\nThe ruling, adopted in a 3-to-2 vote along partisan lines, was immediately attacked by business groups, who called on the Republican-controlled Congress to overturn it.\nEmployers like McDonald’s and Yum Brands are also likely to challenge the decision if unions manage to organize a group of employees at one or more of their franchises, if not well before that.\nThe labor board, which is charged with protecting workers’ rights to organize, changed the definition of a crucial employer-employee relationship that had held in some form since the Reagan era of the 1980s.\nNow, a company that hires a contractor to staff its facilities may be considered a so-called joint employer of the workers at that facility, even if it does not actively supervise them.\nA union representing those workers would be legally entitled to bargain with the parent company, not just the contractor, under federal labor law.\n“The decision today could be one of the more significant by the N.L.R.B. in the last 35 years,” said Marshall B. Babson, a lawyer who helped write a brief opposing the rule for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “Depending on how the board applies its new ‘indirect test,’ it will likely ensnare an ever-widening circle of employers and bargaining relationships.”\nFor example, if employees at a fast-food restaurant run by a franchisee were to unionize — something almost none have succeeded in doing to date — they would immediately be entitled to negotiate not just with the owner of the individual restaurant but also with the corporate headquarters.\nIf the corporate parent were to agree to pay higher wages or provide better benefits, it would apply only to that particular restaurant, in the same way that concessions granted to employees in a single unionized portion of a national company that is not franchised apply only to that portion. At the same time, however, the concessions may give unionized employees at other locations practical leverage in their negotiations with the company.\nMany large companies maintain that they should not be required to bargain with employees of their contractors or franchisees, and that they should not be held liable for violations of those workers’ rights, if they exert control over the employees’ work conditions only in indirect ways, such as limiting what they can be paid for certain tasks.\nThe labor board explicitly rejected that logic. “It is not the goal of joint-employer law to guarantee the freedom of employers to insulate themselves from their legal responsibility to workers, while maintaining control of the workplace,” the Democratic majority wrote, addressing the purpose of the National Labor Relations Act. “Such an approach has no basis in the act or in federal labor policy.”\nWilma B. Liebman, a former N.L.R.B. chairwoman who wrote a crucial dissent in a 2002 case on the subject, said that the ruling was especially important because “sometimes the contractor is such a small entity, it exists on such a shoestring, that you have to get the lead firm to the table.”\nThe case the board ruled on involved a company called Browning-Ferris Industries of California, which the N.L.R.B. found was a joint employer of workers hired by a contractor to help staff the company’s recycling center. Unions are expected to seek to apply the ruling beyond the circle of companies that rely on contractors and staffing agencies, extending it to companies with large numbers of franchisees — even, some argue, to money managers who own significant stakes in corporations.\nThe joint employer designation could also make it easier to unionize in the first place. There have been instances in the past in which corporations appear to have terminated a franchise or contractor when that particular outfit was on the verge of unionizing, simply to avoid a union. This is legal for the corporation to do under existing law, but the franchisee or contractor cannot shut down on its own for this reason. As a joint employer, however, the corporation could no longer resort to this tactic.\n“If you are a joint employer and you decide to shut down, there may well be liability,” Ms. Liebman said.\nThe ruling may have an immediate effect on a case the labor board is litigating against McDonald’s and several of its franchisees. In that case, the N.L.R.B.’s general counsel, who essentially acts as a prosecutor, asserts that the company is a joint employer along with a number of franchisees, making it potentially liable for numerous reported violations of workers’ rights, like retaliating against those who have tried to organize unions.\nBusiness representatives said the labor board was making it much harder to operate franchises in the future, undermining a popular path for many entrepreneurs.\nRichard Adams, a former McDonald’s franchisee who runs a franchise consulting firm, said the ruling made no sense to him, given how most franchise businesses operate.\n“It’s so far from the reality of what actually takes place in the business that it can’t have any practical application,” Mr. Adams said. “McDonald’s doesn’t control these employees — it doesn’t hire them, it doesn’t train them, it doesn’t supervise them, it doesn’t pay them, it doesn’t even have their Social Security numbers.”\nBefore the ruling on Thursday, the prevailing doctrine typically required the parent company to exert “direct and immediate” control over working conditions of employees at its franchisees or contractors to be considered a joint employer.\nBut the ruling moves the standard closer to its more liberal, pre-1980s interpretation. Under the new test, a company can be considered a joint employer even if it has only indirect control over working conditions — say, by requiring the use of certain scheduling software that locks in the timing and length of workers’ shifts — or if it has the right to control certain conditions even if it doesn’t exercise that right.\n“This will clearly jeopardize small employers and the future viability of the franchise model,” said Steve Caldeira, president of the International Franchise Association, an industry group. “If I’m an existing and/or aspiring franchisee, why would I want to expand my business and/or get into franchising if I don’t have the ability to run the day-to-day operations of the business?”\nAt the Browning-Ferris recycling facility, where workers had held an election on whether to unionize, the N.L.R.B. found that that the company laid out certain criteria for hiring workers, reserved the right to terminate them, set upper limits on what they could be paid and defined the length of the shifts that they could work, among other conditions.\n“This decision will make a tremendous difference for workers’ rights on the job,” said James P. Hoffa, general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which brought the complaint. “Employers will no longer be able to shift responsibility for their workers and hide behind loopholes to prevent workers from organizing or engaging in collective bargaining.”\nThe board framed its ruling by noting that the proliferation of contingent workers in the labor market in recent decades had made the issue more urgent.\n“If the current joint-employer standard is narrower than statutorily necessary, and if joint-employment arrangements are increasing,” the N.L.R.B. majority wrote in the ruling, “the risk is increased that the board is failing in what the Supreme Court has described as the board’s ‘responsibility to adapt the act to the changing patterns of industrial life.’ ”\nThe labor board’s action was in line with a key contention of the Obama administration. Top Labor Department officials have argued that the rise of franchising, contracting and other arm’s-length arrangements in recent decades has gradually pushed millions of workers outside the formal boundaries of the organizations that effectively control their working lives.\nAccording to David Weil, the head of the Labor Department’s wage and hour division and the author of an influential book on the subject titled “The Fissured Workplace,” this makes it more likely that workers will be deprived of such protections as minimum wages, overtime pay and the right to unionize.\nIn a testament to the dread with which they regard Dr. Weil’s work on these issues, advocates for business were quick to see his influence. “Let’s assume what he says is correct,” said Mr. Babson, the lawyer who helped write the brief for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “The answer is Congress needs to look at this, not the N.L.R.B.”\nIn a reference to a former chairman of General Electric, he added: “David Weil calls it fissurization.

"Former Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said last week that Mayor Bill de Blasio’s constraints on the stop-and-frisk strategy of the Bloomberg administration was to blame for the uptick in murders in New York City. Mr. Kelly also attributed the rise in homicides in other cities to a backlash to the killing last year of an unarmed black teenager by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.\n“Murders are up,” he said in an interview in conjunction with the release of his memoir. “And if you have a propensity to carry a gun and there’s a policy to de-emphasize stop and question and frisk, it’s only common sense you’ll see more people carrying guns and more crime.”\nMr. Kelly’s book, “Vigilance: My Life Serving America and Protecting Its Empire City,” was written with Ellis Henican, a Newsday columnist, and is being released on Tuesday by Hachette Books.\nMr. Kelly, now president of risk management services for the real estate company Cushman & Wakefield, defined what some experts have called the Ferguson Effect as “a reluctance to engage.”\n“These police officers have been given signals directly and indirectly to stand down and not be as proactive as in the past,” he said. “If they choose to disengage, there’s no penalty. That’s the primary reason for the increase in murder. Police are reacting to what has been happening in Ferguson: They are less willing to engage, and that translates into more violence and more death.”\nAfter years of declines, dozens of cities have reported sharp increases in murders.\nCorrelating police stops with crime is troublesome.\nIn New York, Mr. de Blasio and Police Commissioner William J. Bratton said last week that this summer had been the safest on record, even as stops had declined 93 percent since 2011. Still, the overall number of murders is 8 percent higher since the start of the year compared with the same period last year. Also, Mr. Kelly writes that stops were a deterrent, and that “you can’t measure the amount of crime that wasn’t committed.”\nKaren Hinton, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said on Monday that more officers had been trained to end distrust caused by “severe enforcement of stop-and-frisk in the past.” Stops should still be employed “when appropriate,” she said, but “to change course now, with overall crime rates lower than in many previous years, including 2014, would not be wise.”\nDespite a spate of racially charged deaths around the country of unarmed civilians, either in police custody or while being arrested, Mr. Kelly writes, “it is simply not true, statistically speaking, that American police are on a murderous rampage.”\nTo clear the air, though, he urges the release of the testimony made before the grand jury that chose not to indict police officers in the 2014 death of Eric Garner on Staten Island. And he writes, “unarmed people should not end up dead, even if they are suspected of wrongdoing.”\nIn “Vigilance,” Mr. Kelly delivers a withering attack against Judge Shira Scheindlin of United States District Court, who ruled in August 2013 that police stops violated the constitutional rights of minorities. The case was initiated in 1999, before Mr. Kelly began his second term as commissioner. Mr. de Blasio declined to appeal her ruling.\n“De Blasio shrugged and walked away from a routine and useful policing tool, snatching law enforcement defeat from the jaws of legal victory,” Mr. Kelly writes.\nAfter Judge Scheindlin’s decision, the number of stops declined precipitously. Asked in the interview why the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a political independent, continued to be defensive about the policy and did not claim credit for the decline, Mr. Kelly attributed the decrease in part to better oversight but largely to a local version of the Ferguson Effect: the self-restraint of individual officers.\nTo claim credit for the decline, he said, “would’ve said the policy was somehow inappropriate.”\nIn fact, he not only unapologetically defended the peak number of stops — 685,000 in 2011 — but also writes that on the basis of descriptions of suspects provided by victims of violent crimes, “we were proportionally understopping African-Americans, not overstopping them.”\n“Vigilance” reveals some personal glimpses. Mr. Kelly was a crime victim for the first time at 8, mugged with a friend in Central Park by several boys armed with a baseball bat.\nBefore Mr. Bloomberg was elected mayor, he had suggested Mr. Kelly become schools chancellor.\n“That seemed like a stretch at the time,” Mr. Kelly recalled. “I’d never taken an education course. I’ve never even taught second grade. As I would discover later, Bloomberg is a big believer in the notion that a strong manager can manage anything.”\nIn the book, Mr. Kelly mostly avoids score-settling. He barely mentions his two-time successor, Mr. Bratton (whom he called “a competent law enforcement professional” in the interview), though he attributes a good deal of the decline in crime under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican whom Mr. Bratton served as commissioner, to the expansion of the police force approved when David N. Dinkins, a Democrat, was mayor and Mr. Kelly was his commissioner.\n“The Giuliani administration had only to pass out the uniforms and send the new recruits onto the street,” Mr. Kelly writes. “It was the Dinkins administration that handed Giuliani and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton the single most valuable tool for turning campaign rhetoric into practical policy.”\n“Vigilance” describes 16 potential terrorist plots that were foiled and also Mr. Kelly’s efforts to fortify the new World Trade Center. As a result, the site was shifted and the skyscraper reinforced. Suppose his sons asked him if they should take a job in 1 World Trade Center today?\n“I’d tell them yes,” Mr. Kelly said in the interview.","[""Unarmed people should not end up dead, even if they are suspected of wrongdoing.""]",1389,18,0.01389,0.0005399999999999999,0.01443
"Norman Francis was just a few years into his tenure as president of Xavier University of Louisiana, a small Catholic institution in New Orleans, when a report that came across his desk alarmed him. It was an accounting of the nation’s medical students, and it found that the already tiny number of black students attending medical school was dropping.\nIt was the 1970s, at the tail end of the civil rights movement. Francis, a black man in his early 40s, had spent most of his life under the suffocating apartheid of the Jim Crow South. But after decades of hard-fought battles and the passage of three major civil rights laws, doors were supposed to be opening, not closing. Francis, the son of a hotel bellhop, had stepped through one of those doors himself when he became the first black student to be admitted to Loyola University’s law school in 1952.\nFrancis believed he was in a unique position to address the dearth of black doctors. Xavier served a nearly all-black student body of just over 1,300. At the time, most of Xavier’s science department was housed in an old surplus Army building donated to the college by the military after World War II. It had no air-conditioning, and the heater was so loud in the winter that instructors had to switch it off to be heard. But the science program had always been strong, if underfunded, and began producing its first medical-school students not long after the university was founded in 1925.\nToday, Xavier’s campus is mostly wedged between a canal and the Pontchartrain Expressway in Gert Town, a neighborhood in the western part of New Orleans. It has some 3,000 students and consistently produces more black students who apply to and then graduate from medical school than any other institution in the country. More than big state schools like Michigan or Florida. More than elite Ivies like Harvard and Yale. Xavier is also first in the nation in graduating black students with bachelor’s degrees in biology and physics. It is among the top four institutions graduating black pharmacists. It is third in the nation in black graduates who go on to earn doctorates in science and engineering.\nXavier has accomplished this without expansive, high-tech facilities — its entire science program is housed in a single complex. It has accomplished this while charging tuition that, at $19,800 a year, is considerably less than that of many private colleges and flagship public universities. It has accomplished this without filling its classrooms with the nation’s elite black students. Most of Xavier’s students are the first in their families to attend college, and more than half come from lower-income homes.\n‘‘The question always comes: ‘Well, how did this happen, and why are we No.1?’ ’’ said Francis, who recently retired from Xavier after 47 years as president. We were sitting in the dining room of his stately home in the Lake Terrace neighborhood on a sweltering day in August as he thought about the answer. ‘‘We decided we could do something about it. And what we did, what our faculty did, was just plain common sense.’’\nXavier University exists within a constellation of more than 100 schools federally designated as historically black colleges and universities. To achieve this designation, colleges must have opened before 1964 — the year Congress passed the Civil Rights Act, which banned racial discrimination in all public facilities and institutions — and must have been founded with the express purpose of educating black Americans, though students of any race can, and do, attend them.\nThe first of these historically black colleges, now called Cheyney University, was opened by a Quaker in Pennsylvania in 1837, at a time when black students were barred from most institutions of higher learning in the North and the South. But after the Civil War, colleges for black students proliferated across the South to serve the millions of newly freed people. They were founded by churches, philanthropists and the federal Freedmen’s Bureau, and then by states, after an 1890 federal law required states with segregated schools to open at least one black land-grant college. By the 1920s, black colleges dotted every Southern state and a few Northern ones.\nAround that time, a nun named Katharine Drexel, an heiress to a Philadelphia banker who has since been sainted, used part of her inheritance to open Xavier for black Catholics in New Orleans who were not allowed to attend the white Catholic colleges in town. It remains the only black Catholic college in the country. Its mission is the same as every other historically black college. While many colleges were started to groom the children of the nation’s elite, the goal of historically black colleges has always been to pull up through education the nation’s most marginalized — first the children of former slaves, then the children of sharecroppers and maids and today the children of America’s still separate and unequal K-12 educational system.\nBecause of this mandate, the colleges have been one of the most important institutions in building the nation’s black middle class. The list of prominent Americans who studied within the classrooms of historically black colleges is striking. Among them are Julian Bond, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Sean Combs, W.E.B. DuBois, Medgar Evers, Ralph Ellison, Nikki Giovanni, Alex Haley, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, James Weldon Johnson, Spike Lee, Toni Morrison, Oprah Winfrey, Marian Wright Edelman and Andrew Young.\nThe colleges, created as a result of the nation’s system of legal segregation, produced the very Americans who would eventually take down that system. Thurgood Marshall, who argued the Brown v. Board of Education case before the Supreme Court and later became its first black justice, went to Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and Howard University’s law school. Four freshmen at North Carolina A&T State University in Greensboro started the large-scale sit-in movement in 1960. Two Fisk University students, Diane Nash and John Lewis, the long-serving congressman, helped found the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and were pivotal in the struggle for civil rights across the South. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is the most notable alumnus of one of these institutions; he entered Morehouse College in Atlanta at the age of 15.\nWith black students now attending schools that were once off limits, the percentage of black students who attend historically black colleges has declined from 90 percent in 1960 to just 11 percent today. But the role of these schools has not changed; they are still focused on addressing the needs of those whom privilege has passed over. Nearly three of four students at historically black colleges come from low-income families, compared with about half of all American college students, and most are still first-generation college attendees. Though the institutions account for just 3 percent of all colleges, they award 16 percent of the bachelor’s degrees earned by black students. Further, historically black colleges have always been incubators of black leadership; in the 1990s, the last time data was collected, graduates of these schools accounted for 80 percent of the nation’s black judges, 50 percent of black doctors and lawyers and 40 percent of black members of Congress. Along with Xavier, other historically black colleges like Morehouse, Howard, Hampton and Spelman are also among the top feeder schools for black medical students.\nWhen that medical-school report came across Francis’ desk all those years ago, he was certain of one thing: The small number of black students entering medical school was not a reflection of their capabilities. It was a reflection of the shoddy schooling so many of them received before they ever arrived at the college gate. If Xavier was going build a program to turn large numbers of its students into doctors, Francis knew the college was going to have to do more than just teach science. It was going to have to figure out how to overcome years of educational gaps.\nPierre Johnson was just the kind of student the college president had in mind. Johnson grew up in the 1980s on the South Side of Chicago, the oldest child of a single mother who emphasized the importance of education even as she battled drug addiction. School always came easy to Johnson; he worked hard in class and did his homework every night.\nWhen Johnson was 10, his mother became pregnant, and he started accompanying her to doctor appointments. The science of how a tiny group of cells transforms in the womb into a baby, the magic and mystery of the birth process, fascinated him, and something else captured his attention, too, something he had never seen before. His mom’s obstetrician was a black man.\nThe little boy thought about the way the white doctors at the public clinic had treated his mom with indifference and often disdain. But this black doctor, ‘‘he didn’t look down on her,’’ Johnson recalled. ‘‘He knew she was a good woman who had a problem. And he gave me, at least, something to say: ‘I can do that.’ ’’ Johnson thought to himself that he would become a doctor, too.\nA few years later, he enrolled at an all-black, mostly poor South Side high school, where he continued to excel in all his classes and dreamed of a life as a physician. On his own, he paged through college guides at the local library, looking for schools with strong pre-med programs. He came across Xavier, which boasted of sending the largest number of black graduates to medical school. He had never been to Louisiana, but he decided, ‘‘That’s where I’m going.’’\nJohnson graduated second in his class in 1998. He headed to Xavier full of confidence and expectations. As he moved into his dorm, he found it invigorating to be around so many smart young black people with similar goals. He felt as though he fit in. And then he took his first college science classes. ‘‘It was a pure shock,’’ he said. ‘‘I was extremely unprepared. Stuff that kids knew from high school, general physics and chemistry, I had no idea, none. I had never done poorly academically my whole life, and I realized for four years of high school, I had never been challenged.’’ Johnson’s high school did not offer the Advanced Placement chemistry and biology classes that some of his Xavier classmates had taken. But it was worse than that. Johnson’s high school did not even offer the basic high-school courses, like physics, that are needed to succeed in a typical pre-med program. ‘‘I wanted to be a doctor,’’ he said. ‘‘But I did not even know what the periodic table was.’’\nJohnson’s experience is depressingly familiar to Francis. While many students at Xavier and other historically black colleges come from middle-class homes, have gone to good schools and have parents who graduated from college, too many do not. ‘‘I used to say there was no relationship between being poor and being bright. I watched all of my life young people who were poor and very bright. But research shows if you are black and born poor, you are going to live in a poor neighborhood, going to go to a poor school, and by and large, you are going to stay that way,’’ Francis said. ‘‘To come out of that system, you would have to rise much higher than other youngsters who had every resource.’’\nDuring Francis’ decades at Xavier, racial disparities in K-12 education remained firmly entrenched. Black public-school students are more segregated now than at any time since the mid-1970s. Instead of receiving more resources to help them succeed, black students, almost without exception, get less. National data from the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights show that black students are the least likely to attend high schools that offer algebra, physics and chemistry. A report released in July by the ACT and the United Negro College Fund laid out the tragic consequences: Nearly two-thirds of black students who took the ACT did not meet any of the test’s college-readiness benchmarks, twice the national average.\nAt Xavier, Johnson found himself the embodiment of those statistics, and he was reeling. As he sat in his general biology and chemistry classes, in which even basic concepts were unfamiliar, he tried to quiet the rising panic, thinking that if he did what he had always done, just worked harder, he would get it. A few short months earlier, he was among the smartest kids in school; now he found himself studying all night only to eke out C’s and D’s on the weekly quizzes given by his professors. Johnson realized that if he was going to make it, he needed help. He scheduled an appointment with Professor J.W. Carmichael.\nCarmichael, a chemistry professor, arrived at Xavier in 1970, not long after Francis was named president. At the time, Carmichael was young, untenured and brashly outspoken about what the college could be doing to place more of its students in medical schools. Despite its rigorous science program, Xavier was sending only about five to eight graduates to medical school each year.\nCarmichael’s candor caught Francis’ attention, and he chose him to run the pre-med program and implement his vision. Francis believed that Xavier should not follow the example of most pre-med programs — ‘‘Look to your left, look to your right; only one of you will still be here at the end’’ — which work to weed out students. To him, that model squandered the talent of far too many students, especially black ones. Instead of compelling students to compete against one another, he said, it made much more sense, both morally and practically, to encourage better-prepared students to help their classmates who weren’t as fortunate to catch up.\nCarmichael, who is in his 70s now, is short and a bit frumpy and wears oversize glasses. He is white and grew up in a poor family in rural New Mexico, and he knew something about what students like Johnson experienced when they arrived at college. As the new pre-med adviser, Carmichael worked with faculty members across the sciences to set up a highly structured system to address students’ problems early and direct them toward help.\nWhen Johnson walked through the door of Carmichael’s office, it meant the program was working as planned. The quizzes Johnson did so poorly on in his first few weeks were designed as part of Xavier’s early-alert system. Carmichael believed that a student needed to know he was failing long before he took his midterm exam. He connected Johnson to tutoring centers set up for each of his science courses. There, Johnson met students from other classes, and they began holding large study groups led by a particularly brilliant classmate who would quickly learn the material and then teach it to others. Students would stay up until the wee hours of the morning helping one another. ‘‘You have almost a hundred kids asking questions, discussing the material,’’ Johnson said. ‘‘To see the material broken down that way was just amazing. And if you didn’t get it, they’d explain it again. And if you still didn’t get it, they’d explain it again.’’\nThese study groups encouraged just the sort of collaboration Francis had imagined. ‘‘It took the competition out of it,’’ Johnson said. ‘‘It wasn’t, ‘I’m mad because you got an A.’ It was, ‘How do we both do that on the next test?’ We had this feeling if we all stuck together and helped each other, we would make it.’’ Marybeth Gasman, an education professor and the head of the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Minority Serving Institutions, which does research on and assists colleges that serve large numbers of black, Latino, Asian and Native American students, has carefully examined Xavier’s program and says no school is better at developing students’ shared responsibility for one another’s success. ‘‘It is dumbfounding to see,’’ she said.\nWhat makes Xavier’s program most unusual is its strictly tailored uniform curriculum in freshman chemistry and biology. The faculty members collaborate on what they will teach and create a workbook for these courses that every professor must use. If professors want to teach something not in a workbook, they must present it to the faculty group for approval. The workbooks take the complicated material in science textbooks, which often overwhelms students, and specifies, step by step, everything students need to know for the class. The faculty members then incorporate regular tests and drills, not only to assess students but also to evaluate whether professors need to adjust their teaching. ‘‘This is fundamentally different than the way curriculum is taught across the country,’’ Gasman said. ‘‘What happens with faculty in general: We don’t want anyone telling us what to do in our classes; we pick our textbooks; we know what is right for our students. But they teach to where the students are and not just the way they want to teach.’’\nFor Johnson, when the workbooks and the study groups weren’t enough, he would spend hours after class in his professors’ offices as they patiently walked him through the material. By the second semester, Johnson was exhausted, but he was earning A’s and B’s again.\nExcelling in biology and chemistry is only part of what gets students into medical school. Just as critical to Xavier’s success is the blueprint it created to help students navigate every step in the process of becoming desirable medical-school candidates. ‘‘Our formula is built on believing there is no point in time where a pre-med student at this university shouldn’t know what they ought to be doing to get into medical school,’’ Quo Vadis Webster, Xavier’s current pre-med adviser, told me. By the end of the first semester, Johnson and other pre-med students needed to turn in the first of many personal statements that were critiqued by the university’s writing center. These essays, written and rewritten several times, would eventually become the ones included in their medical-school applications.\nJohnson attended weekly meetings with Carmichael, at which he continually received checklists and timelines, learned of research and internship opportunities and met graduates who spoke firsthand about getting into medical school. The pre-med office had Johnson and his classmates gather their letters of recommendation early, made sure they were good enough and then kept them on file until they were needed. Johnson prepared for his MCATs with the help of professors, whom Carmichael had instructed to take the exams themselves so they would know what their students should expect. Wearing a suit and tie, Johnson took part in mock interviews. And when the time came, Carmichael looked over every inch of Johnson’s application to make sure it would pass muster before he sent it out. Webster noted that wealthy students at elite schools pay thousands of dollars to agencies that help perfect their medical-school applications and for courses that help prepare them for the medical exams. Xavier’s pre-med office, with a dedicated staff of two, provides nearly all of these services free.\nFormer students told me again and again that Carmichael’s involvement was something akin to fierce parenting; he believed in his students and would not let them fail. He would stand in the hall, near a wall decorated with the photos of smiling Xavierites who had become doctors, and reprimand students who professors reported had missed a class or a deadline. Students had to turn in cards signed by their professors showing how they had done on quizzes. Carmichael would send letters to parents on brightly colored paper saying, ‘‘Your child wants to go to medical school,’’ but warning that for some reason, the student hadn’t done x, y and z. If that didn’t work, he would pick up the phone and call a student’s home. ‘‘There is a constant monitoring,’’ Francis said. ‘‘We expect you to learn, and if you need support, you are going to get it.’’ He has a name for this system: love and pain.\nThe system worked for Johnson. After his rocky start, he graduated from Xavier on time in 2002 with a B average. Though the holes in his education continued to challenge him — he had to take the MCATs three times — he attended medical school at the University of Illinois in Peoria, where he was the only black student in his class. It was jarring to go there from Xavier’s nurturing environment. Johnson said he felt like a man on an island; no one seemed to care if he succeeded or failed. But he pressed on, and two years ago, Johnson, who is now 35, completed his ob-gyn residency. He works in a practice in Decatur, Ill., where he sees mothers with sons who remind him of his 10-year-old self, before he learned how hard it would be for a kid like him to become a doctor. Without Xavier, he said, ‘‘I wouldn’t have made it.’’\nHistorically black colleges like Xavier have written the guidebook on how to educate the nation’s neediest students, but they have always done so with less, and many of these schools are now struggling to survive. Though federal law required states to treat them and predominantly white colleges equally, states never did. Lawsuits over the years have argued that states still fail to do so. In 2004, Mississippi agreed to pay three historically black colleges $503 million when it settled a 30-year-old lawsuit accusing the state of discrimination in how it funded and supported its black public colleges. Alabama settled a similar case in 2006, and in 2013, a federal judge found that Maryland discriminated against its historically black colleges. Louisiana is home to three public, four-year historically black colleges. Last year, the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education published a study showing that while these three colleges awarded 40 percent of all bachelor’s degrees earned by black students at the state’s public universities, they bore the largest percentage of state funding cuts.\nAs they have fought to get their equal share of government funding, these colleges have also struggled to build endowments. Nationally, black students are the most likely to borrow money to pay for school, and they also graduate with the highest student-loan debt. That means it takes them much longer before they can write checks to their alma maters instead of to their loan holders. Although the colleges helped build the black middle class, the black middle class is often not in a position to give back. Even in the best of economic times, the unemployment rate for black college graduates is more than twice that of white college graduates. An August study released by the Federal Reserve of St. Louis found that a college degree did little to protect black wealth — the median net worth of black college graduates dropped nearly 56 percent from 1992 to 2013, while it rose 86 percent for white college graduates during that same period. The average black family has managed to accumulate about $7,000 in wealth, compared with $111,000 for the average white household, making it difficult for historically black colleges to find parents and grandparents affluent enough to write big checks for buildings, programs and scholarships. Alumni do give, Francis said, but the donations are often small.\nThe endowments at the nation’s black colleges reflect this stark reality. Howard University in Washington has the largest endowment of all the colleges by far, at $586 million. (The largest endowment among historically white institutions is Harvard’s $32 billion.) Over all, the gap between the endowments of historically black colleges and others has doubled in the last two decades.\nWithout big endowments, the colleges rely heavily on tuition, making them extremely vulnerable to stagnating or declining enrollments. Because they are designed to serve students with little wealth, they cannot make up the shortfall by raising tuition. The average tuition of private historically black colleges is half that of private predominantly white colleges. This means they are often not in a position to pay competitive faculty salaries and build the fancy buildings and other facilities that college students shop for.\nFamilies of students at historically black colleges rely heavily on PLUS loans, federal loans that parents can take out to help pay their children’s tuition. In recent years, the tightening of lending criteria for PLUS loans has caused a sharp drop in enrollment at historically black colleges. In 2012, the Education Department rejected the PLUS loan applications of 14,616 students going to historically black colleges, costing the institutions an estimated $168 million.\nSome of the colleges, both private and public, have started buckling under the financial pressures of meeting very high student need with very few resources. Morehouse College laid off some 50 staff members in 2012. The South Carolina Legislature threatened to shutter for a year the state’s only historically black college, South Carolina State University, because it could no longer pay its bills after years of declining enrollment and funding cuts. In 2013, after Grambling State University in Louisiana lost one-third of its state funding over five years, the football team protested its crumbling facilities and 31-hour bus rides to other schools by refusing to travel to a game. Cheyney State, the first historically black college, is deeply in debt, and a Pennsylvania state auditor has called the school’s outlook ‘‘bleak.’’ The most unthinkable occurred in 2013, when a board member at Howard, long considered the black Harvard, warned that without significant changes, the venerable institution would be insolvent within a few years.\nXavier is trying to weather its own financial struggles. The university reached its highest enrollment in school history, some 4,100 students, in August 2005. Two weeks later, Hurricane Katrina hit, swamping the campus under as much as six feet of water. Xavier was forced to make repairs and take out loans. One thousand students never came back. ‘‘Our enrollment is at a standstill,’’ Francis said. ‘‘The next few years are going to be very difficult for small schools, and particularly for black schools.’’\nThis summer, in the weeks before he stepped down as the longest-serving college president in the United States, Francis traveled across the country on what he called a legacy tour, visiting alumni and raising money for a scholarship campaign. Under his tenure, the school has helped produce thousands of doctors, enrollment has more than doubled and the endowment has grown from $2 million when he started to $161 million today.\nBut sitting in his cool dining room this summer, Francis said he also felt discouraged. With just 3,000 students, Xavier is ‘‘too small to be the No.1 institution sending African-American students to medical school.’’ The college’s ranking, he said, says as much about America’s failure as it does about Xavier’s success.\nDespite all of Francis’ efforts, and those of other historically black colleges, the number of black doctors is still meager; black Americans make up 13 percent of the population but account for barely 4 percent of the nation’s doctors — about the same as it has been for decades.\nIn August, just weeks after Francis retired, the Association of American Medical Colleges, the same organization that issued the report some 40 years earlier that he took as a call to act, published another report. Just 515 black men entered medical school last year. Even though the nation’s black population is much larger now, that number is 27 fewer than the 542 black men who went to medical school in 1978.\nThe way Francis sees it, those statistics should be the nation’s shame. American schools have not absorbed the lessons that historically black colleges have to teach about how to better develop and support talented students stifled in poor communities across the land. Too many universities, he said, are content to recruit the most privileged and high-achieving students in the United States and other countries. He said he saw historically black colleges ‘‘as the conscience of the nation.’’ But, he added, ‘‘I am not as sanguine about whether this nation fully understands the role we play — what we’ve done for this country with so little.’’","[""Education is important for personal development and career success.""]",5874,11,0.05874,0.00032999999999999994,0.05907
"WASHINGTON — Just a day before the arrival of President Xi Jinping here for a meeting with President Obama that will be focused heavily on limiting cyberespionage, the Office of Personnel Management said Wednesday that the hackers who stole security dossiers from the agency also got the fingerprints of 5.6 million federal employees.\nThe attack on the agency, which is the main custodian of the government’s most important personnel records, has been attributed to China by American intelligence agencies, but it is unclear exactly what group or organization engineered it. Before Wednesday, the agency had said that it lost only 1.1 million sets of fingerprints among the records of roughly 22 million individuals that were compromised.\n“Federal experts believe that, as of now, the ability to misuse fingerprint data is limited,” the agency said in a written statement. But clearly the uses are growing as biometrics are used more frequently to assure identity, in secure government facilities and even on personal iPhones.\nThe working assumption of investigators is that China is building a huge database of information about American officials or contractors who may end up entering China or doing business with it. Fingerprints could become a significant part of that effort: While a Social Security number or a password can be changed, fingerprints cannot.\nCustoms and immigration officials frequently fingerprint incoming travelers; millions of fingerprints in a Chinese database would help track the true identities of Americans entering the country.\n“I am assuming there will be people we simply can’t send to China,” a senior intelligence official said this summer, before the most recent revelation. “That’s only part of the damage.”\nThe agency said that an “interagency working group,” with help from the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence agencies, “will review the potential ways adversaries could misuse fingerprint data now and in the future.”\nOne of the biggest concerns about the breach of personnel records has been that China, or any other states given access to the data, could use it to identify intelligence agents, defense personnel or government contractors. Other data on the forms that were obtained, about matters as varied as bankruptcies and personal and sexual relationships, could be used for blackmail.\nDemocratic and Republican lawmakers have been unsparing in their criticism of the personnel agency’s handling of the data breach and its aftermath — and its habit of periodically revising upward the amount of information that was lost. Government officials have not been able to explain publicly why it took more than a year to discover that information was leaving its systems at a tremendous rate.\nSenator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said in a statement on Wednesday that “the massive new number of employees’ fingerprints that was breached is shocking.” He continued, “And it does little to instill confidence in O.P.M. that it took them so long to detect that the number was so much larger than originally thought.”\nHe called for “lifetime identity protection coverage” for the affected employees and contractors. But that assumes there was a financial motive to the theft; officials say it seems more likely that it was a national security motive.\nIn testimony to a House committee recently, the director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, said it had seen no evidence that the data lifted from the O.P.M. over more than a year had been used for any financial purpose, like gaining access to bank accounts or credit cards.\nDuring Mr. Xi’s visit to Washington, he and Mr. Obama are expected to announce, at a minimum, that they are working on a set of rules for cyberspace that would amount to a first effort at a digital arms control agreement. But that would not cover traditional espionage, which both sides conduct against each other. So the theft of personnel files, which the administration has never publicly blamed on China, would not be covered.\nIn fact, the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., said over the summer that if the United States had the opportunity to steal that much data about an adversary, it would probably try to do it. And testifying to Congress alongside Admiral Rogers recently, he pushed back at members of Congress who called the breach at O.P.M. an “attack.” Instead, he suggested, it was ordinary espionage.\nBut despite those public statements, several officials have said in background briefings that the scale of the breach was so vast that it might require some kind of government response. Hackers did not just get the data on federal employees, but also on job applicants, contractors and many others who have been subjected to government background checks.\n“It was so big,” one senior intelligence official said, “that we have to ask the question of whether the scope of it changed the nature of the theft.”\nAlthough Mr. Obama has hinted at sanctions against China, largely for intellectual property theft, the administration has decided to put off the decision until after Mr. Xi’s visit.\nAhead of the meeting with Mr. Xi, administration officials have been coy about what form, and how extensive, any effort to come up with common rules for cyberspace may take. “I don’t want to suggest that we reached an arms control agreement here,” Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, said on Tuesday in a briefing to reporters about Mr. Xi’s visit.\n“But I do want to suggest that ultimately the goal here is we start from a common understanding that you have agreed-upon principles which we believe must include that cybertheft does not go forward. And then as the two largest economies in the world, I think we can lead an effort to develop international norms that govern cyberactivity.”\nBut he emphasized that America’s main concern was the theft of intellectual property that is used by an adversary for commercial purposes. The breach does not fit into that category, and Mr. Obama has not said exactly how he would respond to it.","[""Fingerprints cannot be changed.""]",1308,8,0.013080000000000001,0.00024,0.013320000000000002
"WASHINGTON — President Obama said Friday that he had reached a “common understanding” with President Xi Jinping of China to combat “cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property,” but made it clear that wide areas of disagreement remained over how to stop an escalation of Chinese cyberthefts and the possibility of an American response.\nWith Mr. Xi standing beside him at a Rose Garden news conference, Mr. Obama referred to the cyberattacks against American targets and said, “I indicated it has to stop.” But he also hailed progress with China on climate change and the nuclear accord with Iran, and said that both he and Mr. Xi were committed to pressing ahead against the North Korean nuclear problem, which has defied solution for more than 20 years.\nIt was evident from the comments of both leaders that they had not reached an agreement on China’s reclamation of islands in the South China Sea, which Mr. Xi defended during his own remarks, saying that Beijing supported the “freedom of navigation according to international law.” That suggested that no accord had been reached on China’s claim that the islands are its sovereign territory.\nBut both Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi made an effort to demonstrate that the two countries had made progress on curbing cyberattacks, even while skirting direct references to some of the most contentious issues, including the American claim that China was behind the theft of security dossiers on roughly 22 million Americans from the Office of Personnel Management.\n“Confrontation and friction are not the right choice,” Mr. Xi said.\nA joint statement issued by the White House indicated that the two leaders had agreed that “neither country’s government will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sectors.” Mr. Xi repeated those words, but said nothing of cyberespionage.\nThe two countries also embraced a United Nations accord, adopted in July, that commits the signatories not to target one another’s critical infrastructure — power plants, cellphone networks and financial transactions — in peacetime. But that leaves open many questions, since there are many definitions of what constitutes critical infrastructure.\nWhile Mr. Obama hailed the agreement, he said the question now was, “Are words followed by actions?”\n“We will be watching carefully,” he said.\nMr. Obama and Mr. Xi spoke in the Rose Garden after meeting for more than two hours in the White House.\nThe morning began with an elaborate White House welcome, complete with a 21-gun salute that reverberated across the South Lawn as a military band played the national anthem and then “March of Volunteers,” the anthem of the People’s Republic of China since the 1949 revolution.\nProtesters were kept at a distance, a block from the White House, and their chants could only be heard faintly from the South Lawn. The elaborate welcome ceremony, designed to project a strong partnership between the world’s two largest economies even as the leaders prepared to hash out a range of contentious disputes, went off without the heckling that so angered the Chinese when President George W. Bush hosted Mr. Xi’s predecessor, Hu Jintao, in 2006.\nMr. Obama spoke of the long history of “friendship and cooperation between our two great peoples,” citing the Chinese immigrants who “helped build our railroads and our great cities.”\n“When the United States and China work together, it makes our nations and the world more prosperous and secure,” Mr. Obama said. But in a nod to the countries’ substantial disagreements, he added, “Even as our nations cooperate, I believe, and I know that you agree, we must address our differences candidly.”\nFor Mr. Xi, the most important outcome of the trip was his ability to project an image of strength and command while China’s markets, and its economy, are suffering one of their worst downturns in decades of remarkable growth. His first stop — in Seattle, where he met with American technology leaders eager for greater inroads in the Chinese market but concerned about China’s demands for access to their technology and the data that runs on their networks — was designed to show that America’s most famous capitalists had to pay homage.\nBut the White House also wanted to celebrate areas of cooperation, and American officials leaked word late Thursday of a broad agreement between the two leaders on climate change. The keystone of that pact is a landmark commitment Mr. Xi will make to begin a national cap-and-trade program in 2017 that will place an annual limit on greenhouse gas emissions and allow companies to buy and sell permits to pollute.\nThe two presidents are expected to point to their cooperation on combating the planet’s warming as evidence of their ability to put aside differences and use their heft on the global stage to tackle major problems, while also intensifying pressure on other nations to follow their lead.\nMr. Obama’s aides knew that a dinner Thursday night at Blair House, across the street from the White House, and the meetings Friday in the Oval Office had to be focused on an array of topics that divide the leaders. Those issues include cyberattacks for which Mr. Obama has threatened sanctions against China, the Chinese military’s reclamation of islands and atolls in disputed areas of the South China Sea, and human rights.\nAmerican and Chinese officials have been negotiating intensely to reach a preliminary deal on cyberattacks, an irritant in their relationship that has festered for two years. It has taken on new urgency at the White House since a hacking episode at the Office of Personnel Management allowed the theft of 22 million security dossiers and 5.6 million fingerprints. Officials have been discussing a pact that would amount to an agreement not to attack each other’s critical infrastructure during peacetime.\nBut they were under pressure to do more, because such an agreement would be largely symbolic — neither country would gain from such an attack unless it was part of broader hostilities — and it would not address state-sponsored theft of intellectual property or personal information, one of the most delicate areas.\nBefore the discussions on China’s move to build runways and other infrastructure on artificial islands in contested parts of the South China Sea, the Chinese foreign ministry put out talking points, saying the vast expanse of that sea is “a big place that can accommodate freedom of navigation by all.” But at the same time, they argued that the new islands were Chinese territory, and that the United States should not interfere in the question of ownership.\nWhite House officials said Mr. Obama would also raise his concern about China’s proposed legislation on foreign nongovernmental organizations, which the White House regards as a way to restrict the rights of civil society groups, academics and others in the name of security. There will be glimmers of agreement beyond climate change, however, including on economic issues. The two leaders will most likely reiterate their determination to work together on an investment treaty, although they are unlikely to make progress on it during this visit.\nThey are also aiming for a deal to expand educational exchanges between the United States and China. And there is likely to be an agreement on rules governing episodes involving Chinese and American military aircraft, aimed at avoiding accidents or confrontations.\nTheir meetings began Thursday night with a working dinner at Blair House, where Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi, along with senior members of their administrations, spent about two and a half hours in private discussions.","[""Freedom of navigation according to international law is important for global trade.""]",1637,14,0.01637,0.00042,0.01679
"Students, parents and educators increasingly obsessed with college rankings have a new tool: the Obama administration’s College Scorecard. The new database focuses on a college’s graduation rate, graduates’ median earnings 10 years after graduation and the percentage of students paying back their college loans.\nWhile Scorecard adds potentially valuable information to the dizzying array that is already available, it suffers from many of the same flaws that afflict nearly every other college ranking system: There is no way to know what, if any, impact a particular college has on its graduates’ earnings, or life for that matter.\n“It’s a classic example of confusing causation and correlation,” said Frank Bruni, the author of “Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be,” a book about the college admissions process, and an op-ed columnist for The New York Times. “Anyone who has taken statistics should know better, but when it comes to colleges, that’s what people do. They throw common sense out the window.”\nOf course graduates of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (average postgraduate earnings $91,600, according to the Scorecard) and Harvard ($87,200) do well. That’s because the students they admit have some of the highest test scores and high school grade point averages in the country, reflecting high intelligence and a strong work ethic — two factors that cause high future earnings. That is generally true regardless of where such students attend college, as long as they go to a reputable four-year institution, various studies have shown.\n“It’s absurd,” said Jerry Z. Muller, a professor of history at Catholic University of America and the author of “The Costs of Accountability,” a study of misplaced and misunderstood metrics. “Their graduates have high earnings because they’re incredibly selective about who they let in. And many of them come from privileged backgrounds, which also correlates with high earnings.”\nThe College Scorecard does not rank colleges, but anyone can use the data to do so. M.I.T. (No. 6 on Scorecard earnings) and Harvard (No. 8) are the only universities in the Scorecard’s top 10 that are also highly ranked by the influential U.S. News and World Report. The other schools have a narrow focus on highly paid skills. The No. 1 school on Scorecard is MCPHS University, whose graduates earn, on average, $116,400. (MCPHS stands for Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, which is not even ranked by U.S. News.)\nBut pay, of course, says nothing about the relative quality of different colleges. “If you go to M.I.T. and earn a degree in engineering, you’re going to make more than if you go to Oberlin and major in music performance,” Professor Muller said. “But you already know this. To rank the value of colleges based on the ultimate earnings of their graduates radically narrows the concept of what college is supposed to be for.”\nAndrew Delbanco, a professor at Columbia University and author of the book “College: What It Was, Is, and Should Be,” agreed. “Holding colleges accountable for how well they prepare students for postcollege life is a good thing in principle,” he said. “But measuring that preparation in purely monetary terms raises many dangers. Should colleges be encouraged first and foremost to maximize the net worth of their graduates? I don’t think so.”\nAnd that is assuming the earnings data is reliable. Scorecard draws from a substantial database of tax returns, but measures the postgraduate incomes only of students who received federal loans or grants, which excludes most students from high-income families. And high family income is a factor that correlates strongly with postgraduate earnings.\nPayScale, which ranks colleges based on postgraduate earnings reported by users of its web services, produces numbers that in many cases are substantially different from Scorecard’s. PayScale’s “midcareer” earnings for graduates of Harvard (ranked third at $126,000) and M.I.T., (No. 6, at $124,000) are much higher than Scorecard’s figures.\nAs with Scorecard, PayScale’s top-ranked institutions, SUNY-Maritime College in the Bronx ($134,000) and Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, Calif. ($133,000), train students for specialized, high-paying fields.\nU.S. News does not even include earnings data in its ranking formula, although it said it might do so. “The federal data is a large and new data set, and we’re studying it,” said Brian Kelly, editor and chief content officer for U.S. News. “It represents a subset of students, and we’re looking closely to determine if it in fact tells us what it claims to.”\nSome schools highly ranked by U.S. News — Grinnell, Smith and Wellesley, for example — have low rankings on PayScale and low earnings results on Scorecard. Mr. Kelly said U.S. News was examining these “anomalies.”\nThis year, the Brookings Institution published its own ambitious college rankings that try to improve upon what it sees as flaws in the other lists. It calculates the “value added” of each college by comparing what graduates would be expected to earn given their entering characteristics to what they do earn after graduating.\nBecause of their high test scores and other factors, students entering Harvard would be expected to do well in postgraduate earnings (a projected $85,950, according to Brookings). That they actually earned $118,200 is a measure of what a Harvard education added to their potential earnings.\nThe Brookings rankings factor in the nature of a college’s curriculum, the career choices of its graduates and the percentage of graduates prepared for so-called STEM occupations (science, technology, engineering and math), so like Scorecard and PayScale results, its rankings are dominated by schools with narrow focuses on those high-paying areas.\nOf the eight schools earning perfect scores of 100 in its rankings, five have technology-focused curriculums: California Institute of Technology; M.I.T.; Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Ind.; SUNY-Maritime; and Clarkson University in Potsdam, N.Y. (Brookings draws its data from PayScale, LinkedIn and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.)\nJonathan Rothwell, a fellow at Brookings and an author of the study, said that many educators applauded this approach but it had drawn criticism from the liberal arts community, which says it unduly weights a narrow focus on high-paying STEM fields. Mr. Rothwell defended that approach, noting that a college’s curriculum and what field a student studies were “hugely relevant to graduate success.”\nBut he acknowledged that liberal arts programs and programs that train students for lower-paying fields were valuable to both individuals and society. “If your only goal is to make as much money as possible, you should study engineering, computer science, biology or business,” he said. “But most people are interested in more than just making money.”\nSo, for the benefit of those people, I asked Mr. Rothwell to do a ranking that deleted the curriculum component and identified the highest “value added” colleges regardless of major. I’m calling this the Brookings-Common Sense ranking. Here’s the top 10:\n3. Washington and Lee University\n10. Pacific Lutheran University\nUnder this methodology, liberal arts schools like Colgate and Carleton shot up the rankings. No Ivy League schools made the top 20 on this list, suggesting that many of those students have an edge heading into college. The highest-ranked Ivy was Brown, at No. 45. And most of the engineering and technical schools, even M.I.T. and Caltech, stripped of their curricular weighting, plummeted. (I studied history and French at DePauw University, a liberal arts college, which ranked No. 19.)\nThe bottom line is that no ranking system or formula can really answer the question of what college a student should attend. Getting into a highly selective, top-ranked college may confer bragging rights, status and connections, but it doesn’t necessarily contribute to a good education or lifelong success, financial or otherwise.\nThe obsession with college rankings and graduates’ earnings “is just the most recent example of a larger phenomenon, which is that the gathering of numerical information acts as a kind of wish fulfillment,” Professor Muller said. “If you have enough metrics and benchmarks, somehow people believe that’s going to solve a major problem. It rarely does.”","[""Most people are interested in more than just making money.""]",1876,12,0.01876,0.00035999999999999997,0.019119999999999998
"MIAMI — Amid the alligators, oversize iguanas, pythons and giant snails that habitually seize the spotlight in Florida, there stands a more mundane but no less iconic creature that roams the state: the Florida black bear.\nThe bears, or those who represent their interests, recently got their day in court as lawyers fought over whether Florida should allow them to be hunted for the first time in 21 years. The bears lost.\nA Tallahassee judge ruled this month that the hunt could begin as scheduled on Oct. 24, rejecting a request by opponents for a temporary halt until their lawsuit over the issue is resolved. Opponents, led by Speak Up Wekiva, a conservation group, filed an appeal on Thursday.\nSupporters of the hunt cite four serious attacks by bears in the suburbs of central Florida and the panhandle over the past year. But in a state that has its fair share of hunters, the bear hunt has angered a broad portion of Floridians, including environmentalists and even some hunters, who call it premature and an ineffective way to deal with the nuisance that some bears pose in the suburbs.\nJust as worrisome for opponents is that Florida will not complete the latest survey of its once-dwindling bear population until next year. The hunt is capped at 320 bears, but in court on Thursday, opponents said that number was arbitrary and not based on definitive data. State officials said the bear population was healthy enough to warrant a limited hunt.\nOnly three years ago, the state still listed the Florida black bear as threatened. The bear — which was headed for extinction in the 1970s, when only 300 or so remained — is a subspecies of black bears from other parts of the United States and now exists only in Florida.\n“This adds to the angst, the public angst,” said Chuck O’Neal, a Florida environmental activist and real estate investor who is part of a coalition suing the state over the hunt. “At most, there are 3,500 of these in the entire state of 19 million people, and to say that 3,500 are too much, well, there are states that have 30,000 black bears. There is no reason that with such a small population here, we can’t coexist with these bears.”\nOf the 41 states with bear populations, 31 allow hunts. Florida would be the 32nd.\nIn April, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, a state agency, voted 3 to 2 to allow a hunt. The number of encounters between bears and people has grown as the animals increasingly venture into suburban areas to forage for food in garbage cans.\nAgency officials said opponents were overstating the impact the limited hunt would have on Florida’s bear population. A 2002 study put the number of bears in the state at 3,000. The latest data in two regions show that the number has grown considerably, said Thomas H. Eason, the director of the agency’s habitat and species conservation division.\nThe agency is now conducting a more thorough count with DNA. It has finished gathering data on two regions and will complete three more by next year.\nThe bears are scattered through seven regions statewide. Officials said hunters were barred from three because there are not enough bears in those areas to sustain a hunt. The hunt, they said, is one of several tools used to manage bear populations and will not hinder their recovery.\nWildlife officials described the hunt as “conservative” compared with those in other states because of its restrictions. It will run two to seven days, ending when 320 bears have been killed. Hunters will be able to call a special number to check whether the quota has been met. No dogs or baits will be allowed, and bears under 100 pounds or females with cubs may not be hunted.\nSo far, nearly 2,400 people have bought permits, a number that is expected to grow.\n“Other states have a much longer season and fewer of the regulations that we have limiting this,” said Diane Eggeman, director of the state commission’s hunting and game management division.\nAliese P. Priddy, a commissioner and ranch owner, said it was highly unlikely that hunters could kill 320 bears in the first two days, a claim that opponents disputed.\n“It’s not easy to hunt a bear,” Ms. Priddy said. “I don’t think there should be a concern about going over the quota.”\nBut Ron Bergeron, a hunter and landowner who lives amid wildlife in the Everglades and is one of two commissioners who voted against the hunt, said he had done so out of common sense: There is no compelling reason, he said, no sudden bear emergency, that warrants rushing into a hunt before the latest science-based population studies are completed.\nWhat’s more, Mr. Bergeron added, the agency agrees that the hunt will do nothing to curtail the intrusion of bears into suburban areas. Bears have been wandering into suburbs more frequently to forage through garbage because of declines in one of their favorite sources of natural food, saw palmetto berries, which are being overharvested. To address the problem, the state agriculture commissioner issued a moratorium this year on picking the berries on state land.\nThe most effective way to dampen a hungry bear’s enthusiasm for garbage, wildlife experts said, is to use bear-resistant trash cans. The commission is looking at the cost and logistics of buying them for affected areas.\nIn Volusia County, where some homeowners associations require the containers, encounters with bears dropped 95 percent, Mr. Bergeron said.\n“You are not going to stop bears coming into neighborhoods from just having a hunt,” he said. “Hunting is a management tool for when the population is greater than the environment. Then it’s appropriate. First of all, you have to have all your science and assessments in place.”","[""The most effective way to dampen a hungry bear\u2019s enthusiasm for garbage is to use bear-resistant trash cans.""]",1336,23,0.01336,0.00069,0.01405
"WASHINGTON — Last fall, federal agents raided the home and office of Robin L. Raphel in search of proof that she, a seasoned member of America’s diplomatic corps, was spying for Pakistan. But officials now say the spying investigation has all but fizzled, leaving the Justice Department to decide whether to prosecute Ms. Raphel for the far less serious charge of keeping classified information in her home.\nThe fallout from the investigation has in the meantime seriously damaged Ms. Raphel’s reputation, built over decades in some of the world’s most volatile countries.\nIf the Justice Department declines to file spying charges, as several officials said they expected, it will be the latest example of American law enforcement agencies bringing an espionage investigation into the public eye, only to see it dissipate under further scrutiny. Last month, the Justice Department dropped charges against a Temple University physicist who had been accused of sharing sensitive information with China. In May, prosecutors dropped all charges against a government hydrologist who had been under investigation for espionage.\nMs. Raphel, in negotiations with the government, has rejected plea deals and has been adamant that she face no charges, according to current and former government officials, particularly because the Justice Department has been criticized in recent years for handing out inconsistent punishments to American officials who mishandle classified information.\nBoth the Justice Department and a lawyer for Ms. Raphel, Amy Jeffress, declined to comment.\nThe Raphel case has also been caught in the crosswinds of America’s tempestuous relationship with Pakistan, a strong Cold War alliance that has frayed since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks amid recriminations between Washington and Islamabad. Ms. Raphel has for decades been at the center of shaping American policy toward Pakistan, and she has maintained close ties to Pakistani officials even as many of her colleagues became disenchanted with what they saw as Islamabad’s duplicity in the fight against terrorism.\nAgainst that backdrop, the federal investigation has delved into the murky world of international statecraft, where diplomats exert influence through a careful dance of trading, sharing and eliciting information. Some American investigators viewed Ms. Raphel’s relationships with deep suspicion.\nThose suspicions became a federal investigation last year when American officials, while eavesdropping on a Pakistani government official, intercepted a conversation that seemed to suggest that Ms. Raphel, an adviser at the State Department, was passing American secrets to Pakistan. The reason for the eavesdropping is unclear, but the government routinely listens to the phone calls and reads the emails of foreign officials.\nAfter months of secret surveillance, the investigation into Ms. Raphel spilled into the public when agents searched her home and her State Department office last October. She was quickly stripped of her security clearances and left in the dark about the precise origins of the federal investigation. Her friends said that the investigation had taken a deep emotional toll.\n“Sometimes the whiff of scandal can be worse than any actual scandal,” said Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistan ambassador to Washington who has known Ms. Raphel for years. “More people hear that you were investigated than care to know you were cleared or never actually charged.”\nAmerican officials will not discuss what classified information the investigators found in Ms. Raphel’s home. The current and former American officials who discussed the case did so on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about it publicly.\nOver the years, the stories of American officials mishandling classified information have at times seemed as peculiar as they were serious. John P. O’Neill, a counterterrorism specialist for the F.B.I., once lost a briefcase full of government secrets in a Florida hotel. Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser to President Bill Clinton, stole classified documents from the National Archives and hid them under a construction trailer. As attorney general, Alberto R. Gonzales took material about the nation’s warrantless wiretapping program home with him.\nOne C.I.A. director, John M. Deutch, stored classified information on his home computer. Another C.I.A. director, David H. Petraeus, shared his highly classified journals with his mistress, then lied to the F.B.I. about it. Hillary Rodham Clinton used a private email system when she was secretary of state that investigators say contained classified information, although Mrs. Clinton and the State Department say the information was not marked as classified.\nThe punishment for mishandling classified information has varied wildly. Mrs. Clinton has not been charged with wrongdoing. Mr. Berger pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. Mr. Deutch received a pardon from Mr. Clinton and was never charged. Mr. Gonzales and Mr. O’Neill were not charged. In the most recent case, the Justice Department allowed Mr. Petraeus to plead guilty to a misdemeanor, despite strong objections from investigators. That deal was so contentious that the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, personally appealed to the attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., and said that Mr. Petraeus’s crimes warranted felony charges, according to two government officials involved in the case. F.B.I. agents are still angry about that decision and say it set a standard that will make it harder to bring cases in the future.\nIn discussions with prosecutors, according to several government officials, Ms. Raphel and her lawyer have cited the Petraeus case as the vital precedent. If passing secrets — including notes on war strategy and the names of covert officers, which Mr. Petraeus shared — and lying about it amount to a misdemeanor, then, Ms. Raphel says, she should not face any charges.\nSome American investigators remain suspicious of Ms. Raphel and are loath to abandon the case entirely. Even if the government cannot mount a case for outright spying, they are pushing for a felony charge related to the classified information in her home. Several officials acknowledged, however, that the case would be difficult to prosecute because it would require intelligence agencies to declassify information and would probably reveal secrets about American surveillance of foreign officials.\nFelony charges for improperly taking and storing classified information, while not espionage in the common sense of the word, would be filed under the Espionage Act and could expose Ms. Raphel to years in prison — a far stiffer penalty than Mr. Petraeus and others received.\nThe news of the investigation has shaken policy circles in Washington, where Ms. Raphel has been a fixture as a diplomat, a South Asia expert in the private sector, and a lobbyist. She began her career as a C.I.A. analyst but moved quickly to the State Department, which sent her to Islamabad in the mid-1970s. It was during this posting that she met and married Arnold L. Raphel, another foreign service officer. In 1988, while he was America’s ambassador to Pakistan and after he and Ms. Raphel had divorced, Mr. Raphel was killed in a plane crash with the Pakistani president, Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.\nDuring the Clinton administration, Ms. Raphel served as the assistant secretary of state for South Asia, and then ambassador to Tunisia. In the George W. Bush administration, she was the State Department’s coordinator for reconstruction in Iraq, where she tried to guide the war-torn country toward a stable government and economy. After retiring from the government in 2005, she joined Cassidy & Associates, a Washington lobbying firm that represents the Pakistani government, among other clients.\nAt the start of the Obama administration, Richard C. Holbrooke, the State Department’s special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, reached out to Ms. Raphel to work with him. She quit her lobbying job and was sent as a State Department contractor to the American Embassy in Islamabad, where she helped disburse American aid to Pakistan. Until the F.B.I. investigation, she continued to work on contract as an adviser on Pakistan and Afghanistan.\nDuring her long career working on Pakistan issues, Ms. Raphel has seen the country go from being one of America’s most steadfast Cold War allies — and a partner in the 1980s effort to train Afghan fighters to expel Soviet troops from Afghanistan — to being something of a pariah to Washington. Although Pakistan pledged support for the campaign against Al Qaeda and the Taliban after the Sept. 11 attacks, senior members of both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations became convinced that Pakistani soldiers and spies were aiding the Taliban and other militant groups by attacking American troops in Afghanistan.\nFor their part, Pakistani officials stoked fury in the country about the C.I.A.’s campaign of drone strikes and what they came to see as the agency’s expansion operations in Pakistan.\nAs relations between the two countries deteriorated, Ms. Raphel was considered one of Pakistan’s few remaining supporters in the top echelon of American government. This earned her enemies among government officials in India, Pakistan’s archrival, but also among colleagues who considered her too sympathetic toward an unreliable ally.\n“I don’t think it was very fashionable to say, ‘I think the Pakistanis have a point,’ but Robin did that,” said Cameron Munter, the former American ambassador to Pakistan who oversaw Ms. Raphel’s work in Islamabad.","[""Sometimes the whiff of scandal can be worse than any actual scandal.""]",2025,15,0.02025,0.00045,0.0207

But throughout his career, Mr. Haber has also kept tight guard of a secret of his own.\nMr. Haber was once a drug dealer, selling heroin in Midtown Manhattan, carrying a gun, running a stash house and earning thousands of dollars a day selling bundles of heroin through a network of distributors. He had 10 convictions in his 20s and early 30s, including three drug-related felonies.\nIt was not until he was in his 40s that Mr. Haber, fully disclosing his past during the application process, obtained college and law degrees from New York University and admission to the bar.\nSince then, he has not revealed his past to judges and prosecutors in cases, believing that doing so could place his clients at a disadvantage.\n“I mean, I’m a three-time loser,” Mr. Haber said. “Who’s going to say that they can trust me?”\nIn recent interviews, Mr. Haber said he had begun to discuss his past, saying it might give clients hope that they can make mistakes and still make something of their lives.\nMr. Haber is hardly the only lawyer with a criminal record: New York, like almost every other state, does not automatically exclude felons from admission to the bar. But in contrast with his successful legal career, the length and severity of Mr. Haber’s criminal past stand out, especially to those unfamiliar with his background.\n“I had no idea,” said J. Paul Oetken, a federal judge in Manhattan, who in 2013 sentenced one of Mr. Haber’s clients in a drug case to two and a half years, after Mr. Haber argued against the guidelines recommendation of seven to nine years.\n“He did great work in that case,” Judge Oetken said.\nMr. Haber’s criminal history has, in some ways, shaped him as a lawyer and has given him insight, if not an advantage, in certain matters.\nIn dealing with clients, he says he insists on knowing the truth about their role in an offense, information not all lawyers want to know. That gives him more leverage, he said, in negotiations with prosecutors and allows him to argue more credibly before judges during sentencing.\n“My feeling is that I need to know more than the enemy,” he said, explaining that when he talks with clients, he refers to prosecutors as “the enemy” to build trust.\nAnd when Mr. Haber asks a judge for leniency for a client, he does so with the certainty that some people do benefit from a second chance.\nJohn Sexton, the president of N.Y.U., said that Mr. Haber’s “story should inspire all who care about our society to reflect on the power of mercy and the human capacity for growth.” Mr. Sexton is qualified to judge: In 1981, he taught Mr. Haber civil procedure in his first semester at law school.\nMr. Haber had a tumultuous childhood, rotating through foster homes and joining an Irish youth gang in Hell’s Kitchen, Mr. Haber recalled.\nThere were stints in juvenile facilities, mostly for getting into fights, he said. Then, at 17, he said, he was arrested for stealing a pair of pants from a department store, and spent about a year at Rikers, where he was introduced to heroin and became addicted after his release.\nHe broke into cars and carried out burglaries to support his habit, he said. A state parole document shows seven low-level convictions in his early 20s, including malicious mischief, petty larceny and drug possession. The sentences ranged from a few months to a year. “It was just a revolving door, in and out of jail,” Mr. Haber recalled.\nUsing an apartment on the East Side of Manhattan as a stash house, Mr. Haber bought high-quality heroin, which he diluted with quinine and milk sugar, weighed and placed in bags to be sold for $5 on the street. He said the drugs often came from organized crime sources, although he added that he worked through an intermediary, wanting no association with the mob. His most lucrative work was as a wholesaler for other distributors, and the money flowed: He bought a red Cadillac Eldorado convertible. But the law caught up to him.\nBetween 1967 and 1974, the three drug-related felonies resulted in sentences totaling 12 to 14 years. He estimated he spent about 10 years in detention, after reductions for good behavior, for those felonies alone.\nSandra Lewis Smith, a former city correction official who met Mr. Haber in the 1970s while working as a volunteer at what was then the Manhattan House of Detention, recalled him as a wiry and intense inmate who spoke gruffly, dropped his consonants and littered his language with expletives. His arms were covered in tattoos, she said, and he cracked his knuckles constantly.\n“I said to him one day, ‘You’re not even a good criminal — you’re in jail every minute,’ ” Ms. Smith recalled.\nMr. Haber committed to changing his life, and credits Ms. Smith for helping him build self-respect, confidence and his intellect. “She didn’t judge me,” he said. “She basically said to me that your life can go in two directions right now.”\nHe obtained a Regents diploma while an inmate at Clinton state prison, and took community college classes at Green Haven state prison. At Fishkill state prison, he was allowed to study at a nearby college. After his release in 1976, he worked as a counselor at an offenders’ aid organization, while obtaining a degree from N.Y.U.’s School of Continuing Education.\nWhile he was on parole, Mr. Haber met Emily Jane Goodman, a lawyer who would later serve for nearly 25 years as a State Supreme Court justice before retiring from the bench in 2012.\nMs. Goodman tutored him; his grammar and vocabulary were atrocious, she said. But one day she said he would make a good lawyer. “She said, ‘Nothing is impossible,’ ” Mr. Haber recalled. “She really motivated me.”\n“He kind of became my project,” she recalled, adding, “I didn’t plan to fall in love with him.” They were married in 1983, and had a daughter, Justine, named after justice. (The marriage ended in the mid-1990s; Mr. Haber has been married to Maria Theodoulou, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, for 16 years.)\nWith Ms. Goodman’s encouragement and assistance, Mr. Haber was accepted at N.Y.U.’s School of Law, receiving a prestigious Root-Tilden scholarship for students who agreed to pursue public service jobs. Stephen Gillers, a law professor and then chairman of the admissions committee, said there were concerns. “The gravity of his offense was at the outer boundary of what we were prepared to accept,” Professor Gillers recalled. “But it didn’t cross that line, mainly because there was no violence.”\nEarning a law degree in 1984, Mr. Haber joined the Legal Aid Society, trying murder, robbery and drug cases; in 1993, he opened his own practice.\nA review of sentencing transcripts in two dozen of his cases shows him repeatedly asking that clients who have demonstrated the capacity for change be given that chance. “Consider the whole human being rather than the rap sheet,” he told one judge last year.\nAppearing before Judge Oetken, Mr. Haber argued that a 30-year-old single mother convicted in a drug case would not benefit from a long incarceration.\nThe judge agreed: “I really believe, as Mr. Haber points out, these are exactly the kinds of cases that are the least likely to lead to recidivism and repeat offenders.”\nIn 2012, Mr. Haber requested time served for a man with a decade-old drug crime, arguing his client had changed his life. He got two years.\nThe judge, Alvin K. Hellerstein, praised Mr. Haber’s work in a recent interview.\n“He’s not a scholar — you don’t look for his briefs,” he said. “He’s a very down-to-earth guy who succeeds because he levels with the jury.” The judge added: “He appeals to their common sense. What he says is always reliable.”\nIn recent years, Mr. Haber has been less private, and has collaborated with a film producer who wants to dramatize his life, depicted briefly in a partly fictional promotional video.\nClients whom Mr. Haber has told about his prior life reacted positively, he said.\n“It made me feel like I could trust you,” wrote an imprisoned former gang member who agreed to answer questions, on condition of anonymity, that Mr. Haber emailed at the request of The New York Times. “I felt like you would fight for me even harder because you understood what it felt like to be in my position.”","[""People can change their lives for the better after making mistakes.""]",2121,13,0.02121,0.00039,0.0216
"Amelia Flores, a high school senior with plans to become an electrical engineer, eagerly filled out a form to register to vote for the first time at the Kansas State Fair last month. But she left the fair without registering, stymied by a state law championed by Republicans who dominate elected offices in Kansas that requires her to provide proof of citizenship.\n“I think it’s ridiculous and restrictive,” said Ms. Flores, who later received a notice in the mail informing her that she must produce a birth certificate or other proof of citizenship to complete the registration. “A lot of people are working multiple jobs, so they don’t have time to get this stuff done. Some of them don’t have access to their birth certificate.”\nMs. Flores, who said she was born in Washington State, unwittingly joined a list of more than 36,000 people in Kansas who have tried to register to vote since the law went into effect in 2013, but then did not complete their registration. This month, under a rule adopted by the Kansas secretary of state’s office, county election officials throughout the state began to cull names from the voters list, removing people who had been on it at least 90 days. Those removed from the list must start the registration process over in order to vote.\nThe move has touched off a new battle over voter registration, pitting the Republican secretary of state, Kris W. Kobach, an ardent supporter of strict voting rules, against Democrats and advocates of voting rights who say the law was intended to suppress voter turnout. Mr. Kobach was named in a federal lawsuit filed in September by two plaintiffs who had applied to register to vote in Kansas but were added to the roll of incomplete registrants when they did not submit proof of their citizenship.\nIn an interview, Mr. Kobach said culling the list would help address complaints from county clerks that notifying people of the law’s requirements was costly and often ineffective. He asserted that most of the people on the list had moved since their initial registration or “never had any intention of voting in the first place.” And he defended the law as necessary to prevent voter fraud.\n“We now live in a society where there is a record number of noncitizens who live with us,” he said. “This is a common sense way of ensuring that only U.S. citizens are able to vote.”\nBut advocates of voting rights said the Kansas law, like about a dozen similar voter identification laws passed in Republican-led states since 2011, is intended to depress voter turnout among groups that lean Democratic, including low-income and minority voters.\nDouglas Bonney, the legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, said the Kansas requirements might particularly discourage young voters who do not have ready access to the required documents. “It has caused a massive wall for them,” he said.\nAn analysis by The New York Times of the list of voters showed that more than half of them were under 35, and 20 percent were from 18 to 20 years old. Fifty-seven percent of the people on the list did not declare a party; 23 percent were Democrats; and 18 percent were Republicans. The vast majority — 90 percent — had never voted before.\n“This disproportionately hits 18- to 24-year-olds,” said Jamie Shew, a Democrat and the county clerk for Douglas County, Kan. “For a lot of them, they say, ‘I’m not going to worry about it.’ They’re busy and this is just one more thing to do.”\nUnder the law, which was passed in 2011, registrants must prove citizenship by producing a document from an approved list, which includes birth certificates, passports and naturalization records. They may bring the document to a county clerk’s office or email a photo of it. Under Mr. Kobach’s new rule, if they fail to do so, they would be removed from the voters list after 90 days. Residents can try to register again even after being removed from the list.\nThe 36,000 people on the list represent about 2 percent of the state’s 1.7 million registered voters. The Wichita Eagle reported in September that more than 16 percent of people who have tried to register to vote since the law went into effect in January 2013 have been placed on the list.\nSeveral people on the list who were contacted by The Times said that they did not remember trying to register to vote and had no idea why their names were on the list. Two people said that they had moved out of state since they began the registration process, so had not bothered to complete it. Several others said they had wanted to vote but felt hamstrung by the requirement to provide proof of citizenship, and eventually gave up.\nOne of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Cody Keener, 21, said that he tried to register to vote while renewing his driver’s license last year and assumed that his registration was complete. Mr. Keener, a full-time student at Baker University who lives in Lawrence, Kan., said he later received a notice from the Douglas County clerk’s office that he had been marked as “in suspense” because he had not submitted proof of citizenship. Angered by that requirement, he decided to join the suit.\n“I walked out of the D.M.V. under the impression that I was registered,” he said. “When I found out later that 36,000 other people were on the list, I thought about how many people would be in my shoes, and how many tens of thousands of people would show up on Election Day thinking they were registered to vote.”\nMr. Shew, the clerk for Douglas County, whose most populous city is Lawrence, which is home to the University of Kansas, said many people had expressed frustration with the law. “The part that’s disheartening to me is, you hear a lot of people on the phone say, ‘This is just too much to deal with, forget about it.’”\nMr. Shew said that before the proof of citizenship requirement, a provision of the law known as the SAFE Act, went into effect in January 2013, registering to vote required no identification.\nKansas is one of four states that require proof of citizenship to register to vote, along with Alabama, Arizona and Georgia. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, only Kansas and Arizona are currently enforcing the law. In Georgia, officials said they were still smoothing out legal and technological requirements and did not yet have a timeline for when the law would take effect. In Alabama, the secretary of state’s office said that its proof of citizenship law conflicted with a federal law and could not currently be enforced.\nThough advocates of the laws contend that they prevent illegal voting, critics assert that voter fraud is rare. Even Mr. Kobach said in the interview that he knew of fewer than a dozen cases of noncitizens who had successfully voted in Kansas in the last seven years. But last Friday, he moved to prosecute three cases of suspected voter fraud, the first time in Kansas history that a secretary of state had prosecuted a voting crime, his office said.\nMichael Smith, an associate professor of political science at Emporia State University in Kansas, said that the list was populated by many young people who were “very skittish, very skeptical” of the voting process and who would be less motivated than others to vote.\n“I have no doubt that if this population was fully registered, the turnout rate would be on the low side,” he said. “But we’re still talking about enough voters that they could swing a close election.”\nZachary Lamb, 22, one of the would-be voters on the list, said he remembered trying to register, but disregarded a follow-up notice in the mail reminding him to complete the process.\nIt directed him to go to a building and bring paperwork, said Mr. Lamb, a football coach and a Republican, but he had never found the time.\nBut he said he agreed with the law demanding proof of citizenship, a requirement he did not believe was too much to ask.\n“Honestly, I think I’ve just been lazy, and I’ve been pretty busy,” he said. “I don’t think it’s too difficult of a process to go through.”","[""Most people agree that only U.S. citizens should be allowed to vote in U.S. elections.""]",1826,21,0.018260000000000002,0.00063,0.01889
"Mark Bowden was watching a ballgame — the Phillies versus the Mets — on the night of May 1, 2011, when the network cut away to President Obama in the East Room of the White House. “Tonight,” the president said, ‘‘I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda and a terrorist who’s responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women and children.’’\nFive minutes or so after the president wrapped up his brief remarks, as thousands of Americans gathered in front of the White House and at ground zero chanting ‘‘U-S-A! U-S-A!’’ Bowden’s cellphone rang. It was Mike Stenson, the president of Jerry Bruckheimer Films. Bowden had worked with Bruckheimer on the film adaptation of his 1999 best seller, ‘‘Black Hawk Down.’’\n‘‘Mike said, ‘Look, Mark, Jerry wants to make a movie about this bin Laden thing, and he wants to put together all of the people who made ‘Black Hawk Down,’ ’’ Bowden told me over lunch recently. ‘‘ ‘He wants to know: Would you be willing to write the script?’ ’’\nBowden said absolutely, count him in.\nHe quickly reached out to Jay Carney, Obama’s press secretary at the time, to ask for an interview with the president. Bowden was friendly with Carney from a profile he wrote of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for The Atlantic. Still, he was surprised to hear back from him almost right away. It was an encouraging response, especially given the deluge of requests Bowden knew the president must be receiving. Carney said that he couldn’t make any promises but that he would definitely advocate on his behalf.\nThe next day, Stenson called back: Bruckheimer had changed his mind.\nBowden considered for a second and decided he would write a book instead. In some ways, it was a perfect match of author and subject. Bowden specializes in chronicling covert operations. In addition to ‘‘Black Hawk Down,’’ which told the story of a 1993 raid in Somalia by U.S. Army Rangers and Delta Force teams that went disastrously awry, he has written books about the failed mission to rescue the American hostages in Iran in 1980 and the long manhunt for the Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar.\nHis method in those books was to combine exhaustive reporting with vivid storytelling. It helps that Bowden tends to write about historical events a long time after they take place. People are typically eager to sit down with him, and they are usually able to speak freely. One interview subject leads to another, who leads to another, and so on. It’s a process that can take years.\nThe bin Laden book proved to be a very different sort of undertaking. Bowden was trying to tell the story just months after it happened. And only a small number of people — a handful of senior administration and military officials and the Navy SEALs who carried out the operation — had been privy to the events of that evening. There was virtually no paper trail for Bowden to follow; the government had classified all the documents relating to the raid, including the record of the C.I.A.’s search for bin Laden. Bowden had to request interviews through official administration channels and hope for the best.\nHis book, ‘‘The Finish,’’ was published in the fall of 2012, and the story it tells is one that is by now familiar. The C.I.A., working in the shadows for many years, had identified a courier whom agency officers eventually traced to a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Agents studied this compound for months via distant satellite cameras but couldn’t be certain that bin Laden was inside. If he was — a 55/45 percent proposition, Obama said later — the president did not want to let him slip away. The safe play was to reduce the compound to dust with a bomb or missiles, but this would risk civilian casualties and also make it impossible to verify the kill with any certainty. Obama instead sent in a team of 23 Navy SEALs in two Black Hawk helicopters. The whole mission almost fell apart when one of the helicopters had to crash-land near an animal pen inside the compound. But the SEALs adapted on the fly and were soon making their assault, breaching gates and doors with C-4 charges and, eventually, killing their target. Before leaving, they blew up the damaged Black Hawk. As they flew off, a giant fire raged inside the compound. The Pakistani government was none the wiser until the SEALs were long gone.\nThis irresistible story would be told in many different forms in the months and years that followed. Bowden’s was one of several books, but there were also countless newspaper articles, magazine features, television news programs and ultimately the 2012 movie ‘‘Zero Dark Thirty,’’ which billed itself as the narrative of ‘‘the Greatest Manhunt in History.’’ In this sense, the killing of bin Laden was not only a victory for the U.S. military but also for the American storytelling machine, which kicked into high gear pretty much the moment the terrorist leader’s dead body hit the floor.\nLast spring, Bowden got another unexpected call on his cellphone. He was on his way home to Pennsylvania from a meeting in New York with his publisher about his next book, the story of the Battle of Hue in the Vietnam War. On the other end of the line was Seymour Hersh, the investigative reporter.\nHersh was calling to ask about the photographs of bin Laden’s burial at sea — carried out, the U.S. government said, in accordance with Islamic custom — that Bowden had described in detail at the end of ‘‘The Finish,’’ as well as in an adaptation from the book that appeared in Vanity Fair. ‘‘One frame shows the body wrapped in a weighted shroud,’’ Bowden had written. ‘‘The next shows it lying diagonally on a chute, feet overboard. In the next frame, the body is hitting the water. In the next it is visible just below the surface, ripples spreading outward. In the last frame there are only circular ripples on the surface. The mortal remains of Osama bin Laden were gone for good.’’\nHersh wanted to know: Had Bowden actually seen those photos?\nBowden told Hersh that he had not. He explained that they were described to him by someone who had.\nHersh said the photographs didn’t exist. Indeed, he went on, the entire narrative of how the United States hunted down and killed bin Laden was a fabrication. He told Bowden that he was getting ready to publish the real story of what happened in Abbottabad.\nBowden said he found Hersh’s claims hard to believe. Hersh tried to sympathize. ‘‘Nobody likes to get played,’’ he said, adding that he meant no offense.\n‘‘I said, ‘No offense taken,’ ’’ Bowden recalled. ‘‘I told him that he was, after all, Seymour Hersh, and that he ought to do whatever he thought best. But that in this case, I feared he was mistaken.’’\nIt’s hard to overstate the degree to which the killing of Osama bin Laden transformed American politics. From a purely practical standpoint, it enabled Obama to recast himself as a bold leader, as opposed to an overly cautious one, in advance of his 2012 re-election campaign. This had an undeniable impact on the outcome of that election. (‘‘Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive,’’ Joe Biden was fond of boasting on the campaign trail.) Strategically, the death of bin Laden allowed Obama to declare victory over Al Qaeda, giving him the cover he needed to begin phasing U.S. troops out of Afghanistan. And it almost single-handedly redeemed the C.I.A., turning a decade-long failure of intelligence into one of the greatest triumphs in the history of the agency.\nBut bin Laden’s death had an even greater effect on the American psyche. Symbolically, it brought a badly wanted moment of moral clarity, of unambiguous American valor, to a murky war defined by ethical compromise and even at times by collective shame. It completed the historical arc of the 9/11 attacks. The ghastly image of collapsing towers that had been fixed in our collective minds for years was dislodged by one of Obama and his senior advisers huddled tensely around a table in the White House Situation Room, watching closely as justice was finally brought to the perpetrator.\nThe first dramatic reconstruction of the raid itself — ‘‘Getting bin Laden: What Happened That Night in Abbottabad’’ — was written by a freelancer named Nicholas Schmidle and published in The New Yorker just three months after the operation. The son of a Marine general, Schmidle spent a couple of years in Pakistan and has written on counterterrorism for many publications, including this magazine. His New Yorker story was a cinematic account of military daring, sweeping but also granular in its detail, from the ‘‘metallic cough of rounds being chambered’’ inside the two Black Hawks as the SEALs approached the compound, to the mud that ‘‘sucked at their boots’’ when they hit the ground. One of the SEALs who shot bin Laden, Matt Bissonnette, added a more personal dimension to the story a year later in a best-selling book, ‘‘No Easy Day.’’ Bowden focused on Washington, taking readers inside the White House as the president navigated what would become a defining moment of his presidency. And then there was ‘‘Zero Dark Thirty,’’ which chronicled the often barbaric C.I.A. interrogations that the agency said helped lead the United States to bin Laden’s compound.\nThe official narrative of the hunt for and killing of bin Laden at first seemed like a clear portrait, but in effect it was more like a composite sketch from multiple perspectives: the Pentagon, the White House and the C.I.A. And when you studied that sketch a little more closely, not everything looked quite right. Almost immediately, the administration had to correct some of the most significant details of the raid. Bin Laden had not been ‘‘engaged in a firefight,’’ as the deputy national-security adviser, John Brennan, initially told reporters; he’d been unarmed. Nor had he used one of his wives as a human shield. The president and his senior advisers hadn’t been watching a ‘‘live feed’’ of the raid in the Situation Room; the operation had not been captured on helmet-cams. But there were also some more unsettling questions about how the whole story had been constructed. Schmidle acknowledged after his article was published that he had never actually spoken with any of the 23 SEALs. Some details of Bissonnette’s account of the raid contradicted those of another ex-SEAL, Robert O’Neill, who claimed in Esquire and on Fox News to have fired the fatal bullet. Public officials with security clearances told reporters that the torture scenes that were so realistically depicted in ‘‘Zero Dark Thirty’’ had not in fact played any role in helping us find bin Laden.\nThen there was the sheer improbability of the story, which asked us to believe that Obama sent 23 SEALs on a seemingly suicidal mission, invading Pakistani air space without air or ground cover, fast-roping into a compound that, if it even contained bin Laden, by all rights should have been heavily guarded. And according to the official line, all of this was done without any sort of cooperation or even assurances from the Pakistani military or intelligence service. How likely was that? Abbottabad is basically a garrison town; the conspicuously large bin Laden compound — three stories, encircled by an 18-foot-high concrete wall topped with barbed wire — was less than two miles from Pakistan’s equivalent of West Point. And what about the local police? Were they really unaware that an enormous American helicopter had crash-landed in their neighborhood? And why were we learning so much about a covert raid by a secret special-operations unit in the first place?\nAmerican history is filled with war stories that subsequently unraveled. Consider the Bush administration’s false claims about Saddam Hussein’s supposed arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. Or the imagined attack on a U.S. vessel in the Gulf of Tonkin. During the Bay of Pigs, the government inflated the number of fighters it dispatched to Cuba in hopes of encouraging local citizens to rise up and join them. When the operation failed, the government quickly deflated the number, claiming that it hadn’t been an invasion at all but rather a modest attempt to deliver supplies to local guerrillas. More recently, the Army reported that the ex-N.F.L. safety Pat Tillman was killed by enemy fire, rather than acknowledging that he was accidentally shot in the head by a machine-gunner from his own unit.\nThese false stories couldn’t have reached the public without the help of the media. Reporters don’t just find facts; they look for narratives. And an appealing narrative can exert a powerful gravitational pull that winds up bending facts in its direction. During the Iraq war, reporters informed us that a mob of jubilant Iraqis toppled the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square. Never mind that there were so few local people trying to pull the statue down that they needed the help of a U.S. military crane. Reporters also built Pvt. Jessica Lynch into a war hero who had resisted her captors during an ambush in Iraq, when in fact her weapon had jammed and she remained in her Humvee. In an Op-Ed essay in The Times about the Lynch story in 2003, it was Bowden himself who explained this phenomenon as ‘‘the tendency to weave what little we know into a familiar shape — often one resembling the narrative arc of a film.’’\nWas the story of Osama bin Laden’s death yet another example of American mythmaking? Had Bowden and, for that matter, all of us been seduced by a narrative that was manufactured expressly for our benefit? Or were these questions themselves just paranoid?\n‘‘The story stunk from Day 1,’’ Hersh told me. It was a miserably hot summer day in Washington, and we were sitting in his office, a two-room suite in an anonymous office complex near Dupont Circle, where Hersh works alone. There’s no nameplate on the door; the walls of the anteroom are crowded with journalism awards. ‘‘I have a lot of fun here,’’ he said, amid the clutter of cardboard boxes and precariously stacked books. ‘‘I can do whatever I want.’’\nWithin days of the bin Laden raid, Hersh told me, ‘‘I knew there was a big story there.’’ He spent the next four years, on and off, trying to get it. What he wound up publishing, this May in The London Review of Books, was no incremental effort to poke a few holes in the administration’s story. It was a 10,000-word refutation of the entire official narrative, sourced largely to a retired U.S. senior intelligence official, with corroboration from two ‘‘longtime consultants to the Special Operations Command.’’ Hersh confidently walked readers through an alternate version of all the familiar plot points in a dispassionate, just-the-facts tone, turning a story of patient perseverance, careful planning and derring-do into one of luck (good and bad), damage control and opportunism.\nHersh, who is 78, was reluctant to cooperate when I told him that I was interested in writing about his article. (‘‘I’ve gotta bunch of problems with your request,’’ his first email to me began.) He wanted me to follow up on his reporting instead and suggested that I might start by looking into Pakistan’s radar system, which he said was far too sophisticated to allow two U.S. helicopters to enter the country’s airspace undetected. (‘‘Those dimwitted third-world guys just can’t get anything right,’’ he wrote sarcastically, meaning of course the Pakistanis would have been aware of two military helicopters flying into the heart of their country.) Hersh, who worked at The New York Times for seven years in the 1970s, didn’t think the paper would allow me to take his claims seriously. ‘‘If you did so,’’ he wrote, ‘‘you better be sure not to let your wife start the car for the next few months.’’ But after a little prodding, he relented and spent the better part of a day with me, describing his reporting as thoroughly as he felt he could without compromising his sources.\nHersh’s most consequential claim was about how bin Laden was found in the first place. It was not years of painstaking intelligence-gathering, he wrote, that led the United States to the courier and, ultimately, to bin Laden. Instead, the location was revealed by a ‘‘walk-in’’ — a retired Pakistani intelligence officer who was after the $25 million reward that the United States had promised anyone who helped locate him. For that matter, bin Laden was hardly ‘‘in hiding’’ at all; his compound in Abbottabad was actually a safe house, maintained by the Pakistani intelligence service. When the United States confronted Pakistani intelligence officials with this information, Hersh wrote, they eventually acknowledged it was true and even conceded to provide a DNA sample to prove it.\nAccording to Hersh’s version, then, the daring raid wasn’t especially daring. The Pakistanis allowed the U.S. helicopters into their airspace and cleared out the guards at the compound before the SEALs arrived. Hersh’s sources told him the United States and Pakistani intelligence officials agreed that Obama would wait a week before announcing that bin Laden had been killed in a ‘‘drone strike somewhere in the mountains on the Pakistan/Afghanistan border.’’ But the president was forced to go public right away, because the crash and subsequent destruction of the Black Hawk — among the rare facts in the official story that Hersh does not dispute — were going to make it impossible to keep the operation under wraps.\nAs if those assertions weren’t significant enough, Hersh went on to make some even wilder claims. He wrote, for instance, that bin Laden had not been given a proper Islamic burial at sea; the SEALs threw his remains out of their helicopter. He claimed not just that the Pakistanis had seized bin Laden in 2006, but that Saudi Arabia had paid for his upkeep in the years that followed, and that the United States had instructed Pakistan to arrest an innocent man who was a sometime C.I.A. asset as the fall guy for the major in the Pakistani Army who had collected bin Laden’s DNA sample.\nWhat was perhaps most shocking of all, though, was that this elaborate narrative was being unspooled not by some basement autodidact but by one of America’s greatest investigative reporters, the man who exposed the massacre of hundreds of Vietnamese civilians in the village of My Lai (1969), who revealed a clandestine C.I.A. program to spy on antiwar dissidents (1974) and who detailed the shocking story of the abuses at Abu Ghraib (2004). Could the bin Laden article be another major Hersh scoop?\n‘‘It’s always possible,’’ Bowden told me. ‘‘But given the sheer number of people I talked to from different parts of government, for a lie to have been that carefully orchestrated and sustained to me gets into faked-moon-landing territory.’’ Other reporters have been less generous still. ‘‘What’s true in the story isn’t new, and what’s new in the story isn’t true,’’ said Peter Bergen of CNN, who wrote his own best-selling account of the hunting and killing of bin Laden, ‘‘Manhunt.’’ And government officials were least receptive of all. Josh Earnest, then the White House spokesman, said Hersh’s ‘‘story is riddled with inaccuracies and outright falsehoods.’’ Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, said it was ‘‘largely a fabrication.’’ (There were ‘‘too many inaccuracies to even bother going through them line by line.’’) The administration pretty much left it at that, though some of Hersh’s critics have pointed to classified documents made public by Edward Snowden revealing a long history of C.I.A. surveillance of the Abbottabad compound as proof that its location hadn’t simply been revealed by a walk-in.\nThis sort of reception is nothing new for Hersh. A Pentagon spokesman at the time of Abu Ghraib, Lawrence Di Rita, described one of his many (now unchallenged) articles for The New Yorker on the scandal as ‘‘the most hysterical piece of journalist malpractice I have ever observed.’’ Still, Hersh got worked up in some of the interviews he gave after the publication of the bin Laden piece. ‘‘I don’t care if you don’t like my story!’’ he told a public-radio host during one grilling. ‘‘I don’t care!’’ But with time, his petulance cooled into a kind of amusement. ‘‘High-camp’’ was one adjective he used to describe the administration’s version of the events.\nAt one point in our conversation, I reminded Hersh that I wasn’t going to offer a definitive judgment on what happened. I didn’t want to reinterview the administration officials who had already given their accounts of the events to other journalists. I saw this as more of a media story, a case study in how constructed narratives become accepted truth. This felt like a cop-out to him, as he explained in a long email the next day. He said that I was sidestepping the real issue, that I was ‘‘turning this into a ‘he-said, she-said’ dilemma,’’ instead of coming to my own conclusion about whose version was right. It was then that he introduced an even more disturbing notion: What if no one’s version could be trusted?\n‘‘Of course there is no reason for you or any other journalist to take what was said to me by unnamed sources at face value,’’ Hersh wrote. ‘‘But it is my view that there also is no reason for journalists to take at face value what a White House or administration spokesman said on or off the record in the aftermath or during a crisis.’’\nFor those in and around the news business, the fact that Hersh’s report appeared in The London Review of Books and not The New Yorker, his usual outlet, was a story in its own right, one that hasn’t been told in full before. (Editors and reporters may not be as secretive as intelligence officials, but they like to keep a tight lid on their operational details, too.)\nA week or so after the raid, Hersh called The New Yorker’s editor, David Remnick. In 2009, Hersh wrote a story for the magazine about the growing concern among U.S. officials that Pakistan’s large nuclear arsenal could fall into the hands of extremists inside the country’s military. Now he let Remnick know that two of his sources — one in Pakistan, the other in Washington — were telling him something else: The administration was lying about the bin Laden operation.\nOne of The New Yorker’s staff writers, Dexter Filkins, was already planning a trip to Pakistan for a different assignment. It is rare, but not unprecedented, for The New Yorker to run double-bylined articles, and the magazine decided to pursue one. It paired Filkins with Hersh, asking Filkins to report the Pakistani side — in particular, the notion that Pakistan had secretly cooperated with the United States — while Hersh would keep following leads from Washington. But Filkins, who covered Afghanistan and Pakistan for The Times before moving to The New Yorker, spent about a week running the tip by sources inside the Pakistani government and military with little success.\n‘‘It wasn’t even that I was getting angry denials,’’ Filkins told me. ‘‘I was getting blank stares.’’ Filkins said the mood on the ground completely contradicted Hersh’s claim; the Pakistani military seemed humiliated about having been kept in the dark by the Americans. Remnick told him to move on. He ended up writing about a Pakistani journalist who was murdered, probably by the country’s intelligence service, the I.S.I., after detailing the links between Islamist militants and the Pakistani military.\nIn the meantime, The New Yorker published Schmidle’s account of the bin Laden raid, and, soon after, brought Schmidle on as a staff writer. (In an email, Schmidle told me his subsequent reporting has only confirmed his initial account. Regarding the possibility ‘‘that some inside the Pakistani military or intelligence services knew that bin Laden was living in that house, I think it’s entirely plausible, though I’ve not seen any proof,’’ he wrote.)\nHersh plowed ahead by himself, working his sources, trying to flesh out his counternarrative. Three years later he sent a draft to The New Yorker. After reading it a few times, Remnick told Hersh that he didn’t think he had the story nailed down. He suggested that Hersh continue his reporting and see where it took him. Instead, Hersh gave the story to The London Review of Books.\nHersh has never been on The New Yorker’s staff, preferring to remain a freelancer. But he has strong ties to the magazine. He published his first article there in 1971 and has written hundreds of thousands of words for the magazine since then, including, most recently, an essay about visiting My Lai with his family that was published only weeks before his London Review of Books article on bin Laden. (His son Joshua, now a reporter for Buzzfeed, was a New Yorker fact-checker for many years.) Remnick has published some of Hersh’s most provocative articles and, for that matter, plenty of other major national-security stories that the government would have preferred to keep buried.\nBut the bin Laden report wasn’t the first one by Hersh that Remnick rejected because he considered the sourcing too thin. In 2013 and 2014, he passed on two Hersh articles about a deadly sarin gas attack in Syria, each of which claimed the attack was not launched by the Assad regime, the presumed culprit, but by Syrian rebels, in collaboration with the Turkish government. Those articles also landed in The London Review of Books. Like the bin Laden article, each was widely questioned upon publication, with critics arguing that the once-legendary reporter was increasingly favoring provocation over rigor. (Hersh still stands by both stories.)\nThe media would certainly have treated Hersh’s bin Laden story differently if it had been published in The New Yorker, which is highly regarded for its thorough review process. But Hersh insists that the L.R.B. was just as thorough, if not more so. His editor, Christian Lorentzen, told me that three fact-checkers worked on the bin Laden article, and he also spoke directly to Hersh’s key sources, including the retired American intelligence official identified in the article as the ‘‘major U.S. source for the account.’’\nEven if the fact-checking process at The London Review of Books was as thorough as Hersh and the magazine say, we are still left trusting his unnamed sources. Should we? Hersh’s first Abu Ghraib article was based on an internal Army report, but many of the most important revelations in his work come from midlevel bureaucrats, ambassadors, C.I.A. station chiefs and four-star generals whose identities are known to only his editors and fact-checkers. The promise of anonymity is an essential tool for reporters. It changed the course of history (in Watergate, most prominently) and helped make Hersh’s illustrious career. But it also invariably leaves doubts about the motivation of the sources and thus their credibility.\nHersh’s instincts — to him, every story stinks from Day 1 — have served him well. But there are inherent perils in making a career of digging up the government’s deepest secrets. National-security reporters are almost never present at the events in question, and they are usually working without photos or documents, too. Their hardest facts consist almost entirely of what (unnamed) people say. It is a bedrock value of journalism that reporters must never get facts wrong, but faithfully reproducing what people tell you is just the beginning. You have to also decide which facts and which voices to include and how best to assemble this material into an accurate, coherent narrative: a story. In making these judgments, even the best might miss a nuance or choose the wrong fact or facts to emphasize. As Steve Coll, a New Yorker staff writer and the dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, told me, ‘‘You’d want an investigative reporter’s reputation to not be 100 percent right all of the time, but to be mostly right, to be directionally right.’’\nHersh may have been the first journalist to write that a secret informant had steered the United States to bin Laden’s compound, but he was by no means the only one who had heard this rumor. Coll was another. ‘‘In my case, it was described to me as a specific Pakistani officer in the intelligence service,’’ Coll, the author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning book about the C.I.A. and Afghanistan, told me one afternoon in his office at Columbia. ‘‘I even had a name that I’ve been working on for four years.’’\nIntuitively, the notion of a walk-in makes sense. Secret informants have led the United States to virtually every high-value terrorist target tracked to Pakistan, including Ramzi Yousef, the first World Trade Center bomber, and Mir Aimal Kansi, who killed two C.I.A. employees in an attack on Langley in 1993. ‘‘The idea that the C.I.A. stitched this together, and torture worked and they found the car and they found the courier, then they found the license plate and they followed it to the house — that had always seemed to those of us on the beat like it was very elaborate,’’ Coll said.\nBut Coll has never been able to confirm the tipper story. The closest he came was a conversation with an American intelligence officer who had worked with the man said to have been the informant. ‘‘I said, ‘Do you know this guy?’ ’’ Coll recalled. ‘‘He said: ‘Yeah, I do know him. I used to work very closely with him.’ I said, ‘Is this bio that I’ve been given accurate?’ He said, ‘Yeah, it’s accurate.’ I said, ‘I’ve been told he took the $25 million and is in witness protection.’ He paused, and he said, ‘Hmm, that’s the sort of thing he would do.’ ’’\nFrom the beginning, it seemed hard to believe that high-level Pakistani officials weren’t aware of bin Laden’s presence in their country; several U.S. officials even publicly said as much in the aftermath of the raid. Pakistan conducted its own secret investigation into the matter, which was leaked to Al Jazeera in 2013. The Abbottabad Commission Report, as it was known, found no evidence that Pakistan was harboring bin Laden. Instead, it concluded that the world’s most wanted man was able to move freely around the country for nine years because of widespread incompetence among military and intelligence authorities.\nThe most detailed exploration of the question of Pakistani complicity in sheltering bin Laden appeared in this magazine in March 2014. It came from a book written by a Times correspondent, Carlotta Gall, who reported that a source inside the I.S.I. told her that Pakistan’s intelligence service ran a special desk assigned to handle bin Laden. ‘‘The desk was wholly deniable by virtually everyone at the I.S.I. — such is how supersecret intelligence units operate — but the top military bosses knew about it, I was told,’’ Gall wrote.\nMore controversial is Hersh’s claim that Pakistan knew in advance about the SEAL team raid and allowed it to proceed, even helped facilitate it. This is the starkest departure from the standard story as it was reported previously. Logically, it would require us to accept that the U.S. government trusted the Pakistanis to help it kill bin Laden, and that the humiliation that Pakistan’s military and intelligence reportedly felt in the aftermath of the raid was either a ruse or the product of some even deeper U.S.-Pakistani intrigue. Is there any evidence to support this claim or, really, anything we can latch onto beyond Hersh’s unnamed sources?\nEleven days after the raid, an unbylined story appeared on GlobalPost, an American website specializing in foreign reporting. The dateline was Abbottabad; the story was headlined: ‘‘Bin Laden Raid: Neighbors Say Pakistan Knew.’’ A half-dozen people who lived near bin Laden’s compound told the reporter that plainclothes security personnel — ‘‘either Pakistani intelligence or military officers’’ — knocked on their doors a couple of hours before the raid and instructed them to turn the lights off and remain indoors until further notice. Some local people also told the reporter that they were directed not to speak to the media, especially the foreign media.\nWhen I contacted the chief executive of GlobalPost, Philip Balboni, he told me he considered trying to aggressively publicize this narrative when he first posted it. ‘‘[B]ut that would have required resources that we did not possess at the time, and the information against it was so overwhelming that even we had to wonder if our sources were right,’’ he wrote me in an email.\nBalboni put me in touch with the reporter, Aamir Latif, a 41-year-old Pakistani journalist. Latif, a former foreign correspondent for U.S. News and World Report, told me that he traveled to Abbottabad the day after bin Laden was killed and reported there for a couple of days. I asked him if he still believed that there was some level of Pakistani awareness of the raid. ‘‘Not awareness,’’ he answered instantly. ‘‘There was coordination and cooperation.’’\nLatif, who kept his name off the original post because of the sensitivity of the subject in Pakistan, said that people in the area told him that they heard the U.S. helicopters and that surely the Pakistani military had, too: ‘‘The whole country was awake, only the Pakistani Army was asleep? What does that suggest to you?’’ Gall has also written that bin Laden’s neighbors heard the explosions at the compound and contacted the local police, but that army commanders told the police to stand down and leave the response to the military. The SEALs were on the ground for 40 minutes, but the Pakistani Army didn’t arrive until after they had left.\nGall’s best guess (and she emphasizes that it is just a guess) is that the United States alerted Pakistan to the bin Laden operation at the 11th hour. ‘‘I have no proof, but the more I think about it and the more I talk to Pakistani friends, the more I think it’s probably true that Kayani and Pasha were in on it,’’ Gall told me, referring to Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, who was then the chief of the army staff, and Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, then the director general of the I.S.I. As for killing bin Laden, she said: ‘‘The scenario I imagine is that the Americans watched him and tracked him and never told the Pakistanis because they didn’t trust them, but when they decided to go ahead with the raid, I think they might have gone to Kayani and Pasha and said, ‘We’re going in, and don’t you dare shoot down our helicopters or else.’ ’’ (I should note that not every national-security reporter, including some at The Times, agrees with Gall about the likelihood of high-level Pakistani complicity in either harboring bin Laden or helping kill him.)\nFollowing Gall’s scenario to its logical conclusion, Pakistan would have faced an unappealing choice after the raid: acknowledge that it had cooperated and risk angering hard-liners for betraying bin Laden and abetting a U.S. military operation on Pakistani soil, or plead ignorance and incompetence.\n‘‘The Pakistanis often fall back on, ‘We were incompetent,’ ’’ Gall said. ‘‘They don’t want their countrymen to know what they’re playing at. They fear there will be a backlash.’’\nWhere does the official bin Laden story stand now? For many, it exists in a kind of liminal state, floating somewhere between fact and mythology. The writing of history is a process, and this story still seems to have a long way to go before the government’s narrative can be accepted as true, or rejected as false.\n‘‘It’s all sort of hokey, the whole thing,’’ Robert Baer, a longtime C.I.A. case officer in the Middle East (and the inspiration for the George Clooney character in the movie ‘‘Syriana’’) told me of the government’s version of the events. ‘‘I’ve never seen a White House take that kind of risk. Did the president just wake up one morning and say, ‘Let’s put my presidency on the line right before an election?’ This guy is too smart to put 23 SEALs in harm’s way in a Hollywood-like assassination. He’s too smart.’’ Still, none of Baer’s old friends inside or outside the agency have challenged the administration’s account.\nOver time, many of Hersh’s claims could be proved right. What then? We may be justifiably outraged. Pakistan, our putative ally in the war on terror and the beneficiary of billions of dollars in U.S. taxpayer aid, would have provided refuge to our greatest enemy — the author of the very act that prompted us to invade Afghanistan. The audacious raid on bin Laden’s compound, our greatest victory in the war on terror, would have been little more than ‘‘a turkey shoot’’ (Hersh’s phrase). Above all, our government would have lied to us.\nBut should we really be shocked by such a revelation? After all,it would barely register on a scale of government secrecy and deception that includes, in recent years alone, the N.S.A.’s covert wiretapping program and the C.I.A.’s off-the-books network of ‘‘black site’’ prisons. ‘‘White House public-affairs people are not historians, they are not scholars, they are not even journalists,’’ Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists, told me. ‘‘They are representing a political entity inside the United States government. Telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth is not their job, and even if it were their job, they would not necessarily be able to do it.’’\nHersh’s version doesn’t require us to believe in the possibility of a governmentwide conspiracy. Myths can be projected through an uncoordinated effort with a variety of people really just doing their jobs. Of course, when enough people are obscuring the truth, the results can seem, well, conspiratorial. Hersh is fond of pointing out that thousands of government employees and contractors presumably knew about the N.S.A.’s wiretapping, but only one, Edward Snowden, came forward.\nWe can go a step further: The more sensitive the subject, the more likely the government will be to feed us untruths. Consider our relationship with Pakistan, which Obama clearly had on his mind in the aftermath of the raid. In his address to the nation, Obama expressed his gratitude: ‘‘Over the years, I’ve repeatedly made clear that we would take action within Pakistan if we knew where bin Laden was. That is what we’ve done. But it’s important to note that our counterterrorism cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound where he was hiding.’’\nEither the line in Obama’s statement wasn’t truthful or the administration’s subsequent disavowal of it wasn’t. But in either case, it’s hard to imagine that telling the whole truth was more important to Obama, or should have been more important, than managing America’s relationship with this unstable ally.\nThere’s simply no reason to expect the whole truth from the government about the killing of bin Laden. If a tipper led the United States to his compound in Abbottabad, the administration could never say so without putting that individual’s life at risk and making it virtually impossible for the C.I.A. to recruit informants in the future. If Pakistan didn’t want us to acknowledge its cooperation with the raid, we wouldn’t, for fear of igniting the militant backlash Gall mentioned. Hersh himself has written — in The New Yorker — that there is a credible danger of extremists inside Pakistan’s military staging a coup and taking control of its large stockpile of nuclear weapons.\nReporters like to think of themselves as empiricists, but journalism is a soft science. Absent documentation, the grail of national-security reporting, they are only as good as their sources and their deductive reasoning. But what happens when different sources offer different accounts and deductive reasoning can be used to advance any number of contradictory arguments? How do we square Latif’s reporting in Abbottabad and Baer’s skepticism with the official story that Bowden and many others heard?\n‘‘As a reporter in this world,’’ Bowden told me, ‘‘you have to always allow for the possibility that you are being lied to, you hope for good reason.’’\nWe may already know far more about the bin Laden raid than we were ever supposed to. In his 2014 memoir ‘‘Duty,’’ the former secretary of defense, Robert M. Gates, wrote that everyone who gathered in the White House Situation Room on the night of the raid had agreed to ‘‘keep mum on the details.’’ ‘‘That commitment lasted about five hours,’’ he added, pointing his finger directly at the White House and the C.I.A: ‘‘They just couldn’t wait to brag and to claim credit.’’\nThe problem is that amid all of this bragging, it became impossible to know what was true and what wasn’t. Recall ‘‘Zero Dark Thirty,’’ which grossed $130 million at the box office and was in many ways the dominant narrative of the killing of bin Laden. The filmmakers, in numerous interviews, went out of their way to promote their access to government and military sources: The opening credits announced that the film was based on ‘‘firsthand accounts of actual events.’’ And, as a trove of documents made public via the Freedom of Information Act amply demonstrated, the C.I.A. eagerly cooperated with the filmmakers, arranging for the writer and director to meet with numerous analysts and officers who were identified as being involved in the hunt for bin Laden. The director, Kathryn Bigelow, has described the film as ‘‘the first rough cut of history.’’\nThis was a story that was so good it didn’t need to be fictionalized, or so it seemed. It began with a series of C.I.A.-led torture sessions, which the movie suggested provided the crucial break in the hunt for bin Laden. Only they didn’t, at least according to a report conducted over the course of many years by the Senate Intelligence Committee (and others with access to classified information). Senator Dianne Feinstein, who oversaw the report as the committee’s chairwoman, said she walked out of a screening of the film. ‘‘I couldn’t handle it,’’ she said. ‘‘Because it’s so false.’’ The filmmakers’ intent had presumably been to tell a nuanced story — the ugly truth of how we found bin Laden — but in so doing, they seem to have perpetuated a lie.\nIt’s not that the truth about bin Laden’s death is unknowable; it’s that we don’t know it. And we can’t necessarily console ourselves with the hope that we will have more answers any time soon; to this day, the final volume of the C.I.A.’s official history of the Bay of Pigs remains classified. We don’t know what happened more than a half-century ago, much less in 2011.\nThere are different ways to control a narrative. There’s the old-fashioned way: Classify documents that you don’t want seen and, as Gates said, ‘‘keep mum on the details.’’ But there’s also the more modern, social-media-savvy approach: Tell the story you want them to believe. Silence is one way to keep a secret. Talking is another. And they are not mutually exclusive.\n‘‘I love the notion that the government isn’t riddled with secrecy,’’ Hersh told me toward the end of our long day together. ‘‘Are you kidding me? They keep more secrets than you can possibly think. There’s stuff going on right now that I know about — amazing stuff that’s going on. I’ll write about it when I can. There’s stuff going out right now, amazing stuff in the Middle East. Are you kidding me? Of course there is. Of course there is.’’","[""It's common sense that the media plays a significant role in shaping public narratives and perceptions.""]",9497,19,0.09497,0.00057,0.09554
"TORONTO — Stephen Harper did not get to be prime minister of Canada by persuading most of the country’s voters to put him in office, and that is not how he intends to keep the job in the general elections on Monday.\nThanks to a splintered opposition, Mr. Harper and his Conservative Party have prevailed in three straight elections and held power for nine years without ever winning more than 40 percent of the vote.\n“A national election is not a popularity contest,” Mr. Harper said in August, when he moved to dissolve Parliament.\nWith that first tactical strike, Mr. Harper opened Canada’s longest official federal campaign season in at least a century, an absorbing and at times strikingly vitriolic spectacle of political calculation. In broad strokes, Mr. Harper said his re-election would bring “stability, not risk.” The main opposition groups, the New Democratic Party and the Liberal Party, say they will restore Canadian traditions of progressive liberalism and roll back what they see as the Harper era’s bellicose posture in foreign affairs.\nAnother dynamic: After nine years in power, the Conservatives have worn out many voters, with about 70 percent of Canadians saying they want change in published polls and internal party polls.\nOne possible measure of how threatened Mr. Harper feels late in the race was the appearance at a party rally last week of Rob Ford, the former Toronto mayor notorious for using crack cocaine, public drunkenness and other offenses to polite society. Now a city councilor, Mr. Ford remains popular in parts of Toronto, but associating with him could cost Mr. Harper among socially conservative immigrants in the suburbs who strongly backed the Conservative Party four years ago.\nRetail-level politics is now conducted in a dozen or so languages, as candidates try to reach voters at festivals and supermarkets, in community centers and on doorsteps. Nearly half of all residents in the Toronto suburbs were born outside Canada, in China, South Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and the Middle East.\nSome ridings, or parliamentary districts, were decided by fewer than 1,000 votes in the last elections. This time, it is not just party machines that are trying to grab those seats. A swath of nonaligned voters, known as A.B.C.s, Anything But Conservative, have organized online to pool and swap votes.\nFor instance, Olivier Jarvis Lavoie, a 32-year old researcher who lives in a Toronto riding unlikely to vote Conservative, struck a deal with a friend, a Green Party supporter who lives in an Ottawa district where a Conservative candidate is competitive.\n“He said, ‘If you’re willing to vote Green in your riding, I will vote for whichever candidate is best positioned to defeat the Conservative,’ ” Mr. Lavoie said.\nAs of Saturday, one campaign had drawn more than 89,000 pledges to switch votes in close-fought districts to candidates who seemed to have the best chance of beating the Conservative nominees.\n“It’s a Rubik’s Cube here in Canada: a three-dimensional electoral map with history, immigration and vote switching,” said John Wright, a senior vice president with Ipsos Reid, a polling and marketing company.\nSince August, each of the three big parties has led in one poll or another, but the robust, dizzying political culture puts the race well beyond the reach of trustworthy handicapping. At least six parties have fielded nearly 1,800 candidates for seats in all or some of the 338 ridings, spread from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific and north to the Arctic. In each riding, a simple plurality determines the winner. The party with the majority in Parliament — 170 or more members — selects the prime minister and forms the government.\n“Even with six in 10 people hating them, the Conservatives could still win with a massive parliamentary majority at 38 percent of the popular vote, or a comfortable majority at 37 percent,” Mr. Wright said.\nThe same arithmetic might also work for the New Democrats, led by Thomas Mulcair, or the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, whose father, Pierre Elliot Trudeau, was prime minister for 15 years into the early 1980s.\nIn their fight to be recognized as the standard bearers of change, Mr. Mulcair, 60, and Mr. Trudeau, 43, have been hostile to each other but both have said that they would try to block Mr. Harper from forming government if the Conservatives or their own parties do not get a majority.\nMr. Trudeau took over the Liberals in 2013 when the party was in shambles after a historic rout two years earlier. By all accounts, it has been restored to a position as a serious political force. Recent polls show it in the lead.\nThe youngest of the main candidates, Mr. Trudeau has led a campaign of high style and tight scripts, inviting photographers to see him sparring in a boxing ring, paddling a canoe, or picking pumpkins with his wife and their three young children. He recently outlined a child welfare program in Montreal’s Olympic Stadium, saying that the arena’s seats could hold the 60,000 children who would be lifted out of poverty under the Liberal proposal. As a video drone operated by one of his aides buzzed overhead in the nearly empty stadium, he waved, smiled and boarded a bus.\nHis opponents have tried to use his age, relative inexperience, and youthful appearance against him. One early Conservative ad ran through a list of Mr. Trudeau’s supposed shortcomings, and concluded with the line, “Nice hair though.” Another favored punch line: “Just not ready.”\nMr. Mulcair was a bit more subtle, addressing Mr. Trudeau in debates as “Justin.”\nThe condescension may have backfired: Mr. Trudeau proved to be as forceful a presence as his opponents in debates that also included Elizabeth May of the Green Party, and Gilles Duceppe of the Bloc Québécois.\nFor his part, Mr. Mulcair, the leader of what has traditionally been Canada’s most left-leaning major party, came into the campaign as the front-runner. The party had surprised even itself by sweeping seats in Quebec in 2011.\nThat support was shaken when the Harper government pursued a ban on the niqab, a face veil worn by some Muslim women, during citizenship ceremonies. Many in the French-speaking region were in favor of the ban but Mr. Mulcair opposed it, saying that while he was not comfortable with the niqab, the courts had ruled against prohibiting it. The Conservatives, Mr. Mulcair charged, were using it as a “weapon of mass distraction.” Mr. Harper said the ban “reflects our values as a society.” So far, polls suggest, the niqab debate may have undermined the New Democrats in Quebec, and coincided with their loss of ground elsewhere.\n“Harper was a genius in a way, Machiavellian,” said Christian Dufour, a political scientist at École Nationale d’Administration Publique in Montreal. “It was a big, big trap. Mulcair was unable to say ‘It’s common sense, when you swear, don’t wear it.’ He was out of sync with 93 percent of French-speaking Quebecers.”\nThe separatist Bloc Québécois party, which was nearly wiped out in Quebec by the New Democrats in 2011, quickly amplified the Conservatives’ attack. A Bloc ad managed to combine the niqab with the New Democrats’ unsettled position on a proposed oil sands pipeline. It showed a drop of black oil that spills and morphs into a niqab.\nThe niqab issue appears to have had marginal effect beyond Quebec. In the Ontario riding of East Brampton, a New Democratic candidate, Harbaljit Singh Kahlon, 33, knocks on doors every evening.\n“It’s hard finding work,” said Maryam Lazar, 25, who trained as a chemical technician, told him. She emigrated from Iraq five years ago and became a Canadian citizen in January.\nMs. Lazar was one of about 25 people Mr. Kahlon met on a canvass last month with a reporter tagging along. Only one person mentioned the niqab. The others — Somalis, Punjabis, Bengalis, Tamils, Trinidadians, all recent Canadian citizens — spoke about immigration for relatives, jobs, traffic, car insurance rates, and a new sex education curriculum.\nKevin Page served from 2008 to 2013 as Canada’s first parliamentary budget officer and is now a professor at the University of Ottawa. “We have a federal party in power for almost 10 years, so it’s natural for opposition to talk about time for change,” he said. “We’ve also struggled this year economically.”\nMr. Harper has counted his economic stewardship of Canada through the global recession in 2008 as a major achievement. This year, though, depressed oil prices have hurt the western provinces, Mr. Page said, and manufacturing and exports have declined.\nMr. Trudeau has proposed deficit spending to stimulate the economy, arguing that low-interest rates make it prudent. Traditionally a more centrist party, the Liberals have outflanked Mr. Mulcair on the left; the New Democrats say they will balance the budget, paying for new programs with new taxes. Now that the Liberals are being taken more seriously, Mr. Harper has used a cash register sound effect when speaking of Mr. Trudeau’s fiscal plans.\nOne evening last month, Mr. Harper, 56, was led into a crowded Chinese festival in the Richmond Hill suburb of Toronto by a parade of young dancers, swaying dragons and bobbing tigers.\nUnder his leadership, Mr. Harper told his cheering audience, Canada would remain “the most admired, the best country in the world.”\nStanding in the back, James Young, 52, an immigrant from Beijing, said he and many Chinese had once backed the Liberals. He belted out the Canadian anthem to greet Mr. Harper.\nA few days later, Mr. Trudeau drew 5,000 people to a junior hockey arena about 25 miles away.\n“Ontario will decide who will form the government,” said Pablo Rodriguez, a Liberal candidate on the east end of Montreal. “Quebec will decide if it’s a majority.”\nAs shoppers emerged from a supermarket, Mr. Rodriguez, 48, sized up each one’s background. His aim was unerring.\n“Bonsoir!”\n“Buon giorno!”\n“Hello!”\nAn older man called to him in Spanish, and said he was from Peru.\n“De Argentina,” Mr. Rodriguez answered.\n“Ah,” the shopper replied. “Contigo.” With you.\nBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the given name of the Canadian prime minister.

"HOUSTON — The predominantly black Third Ward here, a historic and struggling community, seemed like the kind of precinct that would be sympathetic to a broad ordinance outlawing discrimination based on factors such as race, religion and sexual orientation.\nBut at a polling site in the Cuney Homes public housing complex here on Tuesday, the talk among voters was not about discrimination. Picking up on an ad campaign run by a coalition of pastors, social conservatives and Republicans opposed to the measure, they voiced concerns as parents that it would let men claiming to be women enter women’s bathrooms and attack.\n“I got three daughters,” said Todd Ward, a city worker who had voted against the ordinance. “You have too much child molestation going on. It’s equal rights, but there’s not an equal right for me to go into a women’s bathroom. That’s common sense.”\nMore than a year ago, when Mayor Annise D. Parker and her supporters first proposed the ordinance and steered it through the City Council, they expected it to be welcomed in a diverse city that had become, with Ms. Parker’s election in 2009, the nation’s first big city to elect an openly gay or lesbian mayor.\nInstead, voters called for the ordinance’s repeal on Tuesday, a blow to gay and transgender rights advocates, and perhaps the most significant victory for social conservatives since they were rocked by the Supreme Court ruling in June establishing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. Voters rejected the ordinance overwhelmingly, 61 percent to 39 percent.\nThe political and economic consequences for Houston were unclear on Wednesday as rights groups said their battle for a nondiscrimination measure, similar to those passed in 200 other cities, was far from over.\n“We lost a battle, but we will never stop fighting for equality for all,” Gilberto Hinojosa, the chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, said in a statement.\nSupporters of HERO — their shorthand for Houston’s Equal Rights Ordinance — called for the city’s next mayor to try to pass the measure again after Ms. Parker’s third and final term ends this year. And a national gay rights leader on Wednesday called for an “emergency meeting” with the National Football League’s commissioner, Roger Goodell, to discuss Houston’s role as host of the Super Bowl in 2017.\n“Commissioner Goodell, you have emphasized the N.F.L.’s commitment to diversity and inclusion, respect and fairness,” Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, wrote in a letter. “If the Super Bowl is to remain in Houston, these protections need to be in place to ensure the safety and well-being of all those participating.”\nStill, what was clear was that a monthslong effort by social conservatives to repeal the ordinance and reframe the issue had paid off, through tactics likely to be used again in similar battles around the country.\nThrough speeches, yard signs, T-shirts, banners and ads on TV, the radio and the Internet, they zeroed in on the measure’s gender-identity protections and focused the debate on a narrow issue whose very relevance was disputed by political rivals: bathrooms, and access to them.\nThis reframing cast the issue as a matter of public safety, with claims that the measure would allow men who were dressed as women or who identified as women to enter women’s bathrooms and attack or threaten girls and women inside. The measure’s critics called it the Bathroom Ordinance and simplified their message to five words: “No Men in Women’s Bathrooms.”\nJared Woodfill, a spokesman for the main coalition against the ordinance, the Campaign for Houston, said that the focus on bathrooms had emerged from strategic deliberations more than a year ago, and that the coalition had tested its effectiveness through polls. “When we polled it, it was clearly a message that resonated,” said Mr. Woodfill, a former chairman of the Harris County Republican Party.\nTony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, based in Washington, and one of the few national Christian conservative figures involved in the Houston battle, said the victory thrilled religious conservatives. “This actually looks hopeful for those who want to preserve traditional morality in our country,” Mr. Perkins said.\nThe ordinance was approved by the City Council in May but was not put into effect after its opponents gathered signatures to put the measure on the ballot and won a court battle to move ahead with the referendum.\nThe measure banned discrimination in housing, private employment, city contracting and businesses such as restaurants, bars and hotels for 15 protected classes. These included minorities, women, gays and transgender individuals.\nRestrooms are not specifically mentioned in the measure, which is why conservatives were accused of fearmongering. Still, it was the ordinance’s supporters, not its opponents, who appeared to first raise the issue of bathrooms last year. A draft of the bill included a section, later removed, that would have let transgender people use the bathroom that best reflected their gender identity. Opponents seized on the issue and never let go.\nWeeks before Election Day, the Campaign for Houston aired a TV ad that shows a man stepping into a woman’s restroom and hiding in a stall. Then a girl wearing a school backpack walks in. The ad, shot in black and white, ends with the man entering the girl’s stall and shutting the door. It was one of several ads they released, but “the one we ran the most,” Mr. Woodfill added.\nThe largely local conservative coalition included Ed Young, the ex-president of the Southern Baptist Convention and the pastor of one of the city’s biggest churches, and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican and longtime critic of Ms. Parker, a Democrat.\nA little-known Republican political consultant in Austin, Jeff Norwood, wrote the bathroom TV ad. At a victory party at a Houston hotel, he shook nearly as many hands as Mr. Patrick on Tuesday night.\n“We just wanted to let people understand what the stakes were in this campaign,” said Mr. Norwood, a former elected official in West Texas. “It framed the debate in a way that the other side could never get away from.”\nThey held rallies and meetings at churches. The Campaign for Houston raised less money than its rivals — more than $1 million versus nearly $3 million — and had fewer contributions flowing in from out of state. “We don’t have folks from D.C. sending us big checks,” Mr. Woodfill said.\nOne of their biggest local checks was rescinded. Less than two weeks before Election Day, Robert C. McNair, the owner of the Houston Texans football team, asked the Campaign for Houston to return his $10,000 personal contribution. In a statement, he said the group had “made numerous unauthorized statements” about his opposition to the ordinance.\nMs. Parker, in her speech to supporters Tuesday night, remained defiant, vowing to continue the fight. “This was a campaign of fearmongering and deliberate lies,” she said. She also suggested that Houston’s vote could bring consequences.\n“I fear that this will stain Houston’s reputation as a tolerant, welcoming global city,” Ms. Parker said. “And I absolutely fear that there will be a direct economic backlash.”\nThe National College Athletic Association said Wednesday that it would not abandon its plan to hold the Final Four portion of its college basketball tournament in Houston next year. Dan Gavitt, the vice president of men’s basketball championships, said in a statement that “it takes years to plan and implement this world-class event.”\nBut he also said the city’s vote “could impact the N.C.A.A. returning to Houston for a future Final Four.”\nDespite the requested meeting by the Human Rights Campaign, Brian McCarthy, an N.F.L. spokesman, said Wednesday that the vote would “not affect our plans for Super Bowl LI in 2017.”","[""Discrimination based on factors such as race, religion, and sexual orientation is generally outlawed.""]",1730,21,0.0173,0.00063,0.017929999999999998
"When students were caught participating in an illicit photo ring that was operating out of a high school in Cañon City, Colo., parents and school officials there were quick to say that kind of thing was surely happening all over the country.\nThey’re not exactly wrong.\nWith the growth in mobile devices, sexting has become even more prevalent than when it first received widespread attention. According to a study of Texas high school students conducted by the Journal of the American Medical Association, more than a quarter of adolescents reported having sent a naked photo of themselves, even though they were likely to report feeling bothered by being asked for one. They are following a path started by adults, who report that sexting makes them feel more sexually fulfilled, according to a recent survey by Drexel University.\nRegardless of their age, many people who engage in the behavior would like to keep it a secret. And that is where the so-called vault apps come in. Here’s the rundown:\nThey’ve been around for years.\nSo-called vault apps have been around at least since Snapchat’s popularity began to rise in 2012, and they have offered a sophisticated suite of privacy tools for about as long.\nA writer for the aptly titled Naked Security blog reviewed several vault apps that same year, noting that several of the free versions, like Secret Pictures and Photo Safe, lulled the user into a false sense of security.\nBut users have been able to pay for high-quality vault apps for some time. In a 2012 post, Ricardo Bilton, a writer for VentureBeat, wrote that a company called NQ Mobile offered a subscription-based vault app that went so far as to create a decoy vault that hides where the real scandalous material is buried.\n“It’s a brilliant feature that adds a whole new level of subterfuge to the app’s feature set,” he wrote. “James Bond would be proud.”\nIf you open up Secret Calculator Folder Free, you’ll be presented with the face of what looks like a simple calculator. But tap in a passcode that you’ve set for the app, and you’re able to access your private stash of photos.\nPeople shop around.\nNowadays, there are several apps available for keeping sexts secret, many of them are free and users aren’t really shy about searching for them. There are several threads on the question-and-answer site Quora dedicated to Android users learning to hide apps and photos on their phones, and users on a Reddit discussion thread mulled over the best options for Apple users.\nAlthough confusingly named, the apps are more popular than you would think. Secret Calculator Folder Free has more than 800 individual reviews. With more than 1,500 individual reviews, Private Photo Vault is the 28th most downloaded photo and video app on the App Store, according to App Annie, a mobile app measurement service.\n“A couple of months ago, a friend recommended this app to me when I had a few ‘pics’ I accidentally wound up revealing of my ex-girlfriend,” one user, Appleman7934 wrote. “The decoy password feature is great. Let’s say someone sees photo vault on your phone, and is like what is in that? You tell them the decoy password and it opens up to entire set of fake secret photos so people lose their curiosity.”\nAppleman7934 gave the app five stars.\nThe law is trying to keep up.\nBut what about underage users? That’s a whole different set of problems.\nThe illicit photo-sharing ring that was operating in Cañon City High School might seem notable for its size, but Colorado is not the only place where officials are warning about vault apps.\nIn September, Leslie Rutledge, the attorney general of Arkansas, warned parents of vault apps — like Calculator%, Keep Safe Private Photo Vault, and Best Secret Folder — that are disguised on phones. Ms. Rutledge pleaded for parents to educate themselves about the tool, THV 11 in Little Rock reported.\n“Ask them what technology they’re using,” Ms. Rutledge said. “If it looks like a calculator, such as this app, ask them to go further.”\nSeveral of these apps exist in app stores, and officials in Cañon City say that students were using something similar. Officials are now investigating whether bullying or coercion was involved in that case.\nBesides violating their school’s code of conduct, the students in Colorado could face possible felony charges: Sending photos of underage subjects, keeping those photos or sharing them with others is a Class 3 felony in Colorado, George Welsh, the superintendent of Cañon City schools, said Friday.\nThe current version of the law holds teenagers who send photos of themselves responsible.\n“The letter of the law says that even if it’s consent, under the age of 18 you cannot give consent to share your naked image,” Mr. Welsh said.\nWhat parents should look for.\nParents concerned about vault apps can take proactive measures by enabling parental controls. For families with iPhones, parents can screen apps before they are downloaded to their children’s iPhones with a feature called Ask to Buy.\nBy turning on Ask to Buy, whenever a child wants to download an app (whether free or paid), it sends a request to the parent’s iPhone, and the parent can then approve or deny the download. The steps, which are available on Apple’s website, involve setting up each iPhone with Family Sharing and then enabling Ask to Buy for the child’s iPhone.\nFor families with Android devices, parents can enable parental controls inside Google Play’s app store to allow children to download apps only at a certain maturity level. For stricter controls, parents can download an app called AppLock on the child’s device and lock down any app that they suspect to be a vault app with a PIN code.\nWebsites that focus on digital learning for teenagers provide tips for parents on how to spot a hidden app. Common Sense Media, one such website, detailed some of the ways they use vault apps, and other apps that are used to discreetly take photos.\nTools like Stealth Cam, Private Ninja Cam and Top Secret Camera are designed to disguise photo preview screens and activate the camera through a motion sensor, for example.\nA post published on TeenSafe.com said that parents should be proactive about looking for warning signs that teenagers are using vault apps: Hiding phone screens, refusing to give over passwords and a sudden increase in device usage are all red flags, according to the site.","[""With the growth in mobile devices, sexting has become even more prevalent than when it first received widespread attention.""]",1447,23,0.01447,0.00069,0.01516

"Federal regulators on Thursday approved a genetically engineered salmon as fit for consumption, making it the first genetically altered animal to be cleared for American supermarkets and dinner tables.\nThe approval by the Food and Drug Administration caps a long struggle for AquaBounty Technologies, a small company that first approached the F.D.A. about approval in the 1990s. The agency made its initial determination that the fish would be safe to eat and for the environment more than five years ago.\nThe approval of the salmon has been fiercely opposed by some consumer and environmental groups, which have argued that the safety studies were inadequate and that wild salmon populations might be affected if the engineered fish were to escape into the oceans and rivers.\n“This unfortunate, historic decision disregards the vast majority of consumers, many independent scientists, numerous members of Congress and salmon growers around the world, who have voiced strong opposition,” Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food & Water Watch, said in a statement.\nWithin hours of the agency’s decision on Thursday, one consumer advocacy group, the Center for Food Safety, said it and other organizations would file a lawsuit challenging the approval.\nThe AquAdvantage salmon, as it is known, is an Atlantic salmon that has been genetically modified so that it grows to market size faster than a non-engineered farmed salmon, in as little as half the time.\n“The F.D.A. has thoroughly analyzed and evaluated the data and information submitted by AquaBounty regarding the AquAdvantage salmon and determined that they have met the regulatory requirements for approval, including that food from the fish is safe to eat,” Bernadette Dunham, director of the agency’s Center for Veterinary Medicine, said in a statement.\nF.D.A. officials said on Thursday that the process took so long because it was the first approval of its kind. People involved in the application suspect that the Obama administration delayed approval because it was wary of a political backlash.\nThe officials said the fish would not have to be labeled as being genetically engineered, a policy consistent with its stance on foods made from genetically engineered crops. However, it issued draft guidance as to wording that companies could use to voluntarily label the salmon as genetically engineered or to label other salmon as not genetically engineered.\nDespite the approval, it is likely to be at least two years before any of the salmon reaches supermarkets, and at first it will be in tiny amounts.\nRonald Stotish, the chief executive of AquaBounty, which is majority-owned by Intrexon Corporation, said he was delighted and somewhat surprised by the approval after all this time. “We had no indication that approval was imminent,” he said in an interview.\nMr. Stotish declined to say what the plans were for bringing the fish to market, other than that the salmon would not be in stores immediately because it would take about two years for even these fast-growing salmon to reach market size. It is also not likely there will be much of the salmon on the market because the approved production facility, which is in Panama, has the capacity to produce only about 100 tons of fish a year — a tiny amount compared with the more than 200,000 tons of Atlantic salmon the United States imports each year.\nMr. Stotish said he did not know if approval was still needed from Panama to export the fish.\nIt is not clear how well the salmon will sell. Some leading supermarkets have already said, in response to the vocal opposition, that they have no plans to sell it.\nThe fish are supposed to be raised inland in contained tanks to lessen the chances that they will escape into the wild. AquaBounty and its supporters say this will also be less stressful on the environment than using pens in the ocean. And it could eventually allow the fish to be raised in the United States, rather than being imported, as most farmed Atlantic salmon is.\nFor now, however, the fish are being raised in Panama, from eggs produced in Prince Edward Island, Canada. If the salmon were bred or raised elsewhere, for marketing to Americans, that would require separate approvals.\nHowever, moving beyond Canada and Panama seems to be the plan, according to a regulatory filing by AquaBounty a year ago. It said at that time that after winning F.D.A. approval it would look to build a hatchery in the United States and expand the one in Canada to sell more eggs to fish farmers, who would then grow the salmon to market size. AquaBounty said it might also grow salmon from the eggs itself. In addition to the United States, it said it eventually hoped to sell the salmon in Canada, Argentina, Brazil and China.\nThe approval could help other efforts to develop genetically modified animals. Scientists and biotechnology industry executives have complained that the long, unexplained delay in approving the salmon was a deterrent to the field. Several other attempts to develop genetically engineered animals for consumption, like a pig whose manure would be less polluting, have fallen by the wayside.\nNow, however, there has been a surge of interest in developing new genetically altered farm animals and pets because new techniques, including one known as Crispr-Cas9, allow scientists to edit animal genomes rather than add genes from other species. That has made it far easier to create altered animals.\nScientists in China, for instance, recently created goats with more muscle and longer hair. Researchers in Scotland used gene editing to create pigs resistant to African swine fever. It is not yet clear whether animals created this way would fall under F.D.A. regulation.\nThe AquAdvantage salmon contains a growth hormone gene from the Chinook salmon and a genetic switch from the ocean pout, an eel-like creature, that keeps the transplanted gene continuously active, whereas the salmon’s own growth hormone gene is active only parts of the year. The company has said the fish can grow to market weight in 18 to 20 months, compared with 28 to 36 months for conventionally farmed salmon.\nOpponents of the fish say that if the bigger fish were to escape, they could outcompete wild salmon for food or mates. Among the opponents have been members of Alaska’s congressional delegation, who say they are worried about the effects on the image and health of wild salmon.\n“This harebrained decision goes to show that our federal agencies are incapable of using common sense,” Representative Don Young, a Republican, said in a statement.\nBut some scientists have dismissed these concerns. William Muir, a professor of animal sciences at Purdue University, said the fish posed no risk to the environment. “In contrast, the current practice of using wild caught salmon as a food source is not sustainable; our oceans are overfished,” he said in a statement. “This development provides a safe and sustainable alternative.”\nThe F.D.A. said on Thursday that there were multiple physical barriers in the Canada and Panama facilities to prevent any escape. The salmon are also made sterile to prevent reproduction in the event they do escape, although the sterilization technique is not foolproof.\nThe F.D.A. regulates genetically engineered animals as veterinary drugs, using the argument that the gene inserted into the animal meets the definition of a drug. Critics have branded this an inadequate solution intended to squeeze a new technology into an old regulatory framework. They say the F.D.A. is not as qualified as other government agencies to do environmental assessments. The White House is now reviewing the entire framework for regulating genetically engineered products.\nThe F.D.A. said that to approve the salmon, it determined that the fish was safe to eat, that the inserted genetic elements did not harm the fish itself, and that the company had adequately proved that the salmon grew faster.\nAquaBounty, which is based in Maynard, Mass., has long struggled to raise enough money to stay in business. It is now about 60 percent owned by Intrexon, a company started by the biotechnology entrepreneur Randal J. Kirk to pursue synthetic biology, a term for sophisticated genetic engineering.\nIntrexon has also acquired the company that developed a recently approved genetically modified apple resistant to browning and a British company working on genetically modified insects, such as mosquitoes that might be tested in the Florida Keys as a way to prevent dengue fever. Shares of Intrexon rose nearly 4 percent Thursday, closing at $36.65.","[""Genetically engineered animals are subject to regulatory approval before they can be sold for consumption.""]",1818,18,0.01818,0.0005399999999999999,0.01872
"Not long after jurors convened on Tuesday to decide whether Assemblyman Sheldon Silver, once one of the most powerful politicians in New York State, was guilty of fraud, there were already unmistakable signs that their deliberations had taken a contentious turn.\n“I am wondering if there is anyway I can be excused from this case, because I have a different opinion/view so far in this case and it is making me feel very, very uncomfortable.”\nThat plea to be excused from the case came in a note from an unidentified juror, sent to the judge, Valerie E. Caproni, less than two hours after deliberations had started in Federal District Court in Manhattan.\n“I’m feeling pressured, stressed out ... told that I’m not using my common sense, my heart is pounding and my head feels weird,” the juror wrote. “I am so stressed out right now that I can’t even write normally. I don’t feel like I can be myself right now! I need to leave!”\nA second note came shortly afterward, apparently from a different unidentified juror, stating that one of the jurors — the note did not specify which one — was having difficulty distinguishing whether or not giving New York State funds for “something in return is illegal.”\nThe juror who wrote the first note has not been identified by the court, but the parties made references to her as a female member of the jury of eight women and four men.\nDeliberations began on Tuesday morning after a three-week trial in which prosecutors sought to prove that Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, had obtained nearly $4 million in illegal payments in exchange for taking official actions that benefited a cancer researcher and two real estate developers.\nMr. Silver’s lawyers have argued vigorously that his actions over the years were legal, and that conflicts of interest were unavoidable for lawmakers, especially in a state capital known for its dysfunction.\nThat dysfunction seemed to creep into the jury room on Tuesday; for a juror to ask to be dismissed from a case so soon after deliberations begin is highly unusual. A prosecutor, Carrie H. Cohen, asked by the judge for her opinion, requested that the juror be excused and replaced with an alternate.\nStephen F. Molo, a lawyer for Mr. Silver, disagreed. “She has taken an oath,” he said, “and she should continue the process, to work it out. This is what happens in deliberations.”\nJudge Caproni agreed, saying it seemed “too early for a juror to throw in the towel.”\nBut before the discussion ended, the second note emerged from the jury room. The judge ultimately brought the jury back into the courtroom, responded to the legal questions raised in the second note, and then focused on the concerns from the juror in the first note.\nWithout describing the note’s contents, Judge Caproni talked broadly about how deliberations should take place.\n“I want to remind you that each juror is entitled to his or her opinion,” she said to the jury, “but you are also required to respectfully exchange views with your fellow jurors. That’s the very essence of jury deliberation.”\nThere had been no hint that the jury was fractured or tense before deliberations began. In the voir dire process, jurors with strong opinions about the case were weeded out, and jurors seemed to talk amicably among themselves during breaks.\nThe jury weighing the case comprises seven residents of the Bronx, three from Manhattan and one each from Westchester and Putnam Counties. They range in age from 28 to 69, with four members in their 50s. Two-thirds of the jurors have college or graduate degrees.\nThe jury includes three people in nursing, a transit employee, a campus recruiter, an employee with the New York City Education Department, a salesman, a preschool teacher, a cabdriver, an office manager and a technician. One unemployed juror had worked in advertising.\nOn Tuesday, there was yet another issue with a juror. Another of Mr. Silver’s lawyers, Joel Cohen, told the judge at a sidebar conference that a male juror on the panel had been observed talking to someone inside an NBC News truck near the courthouse.\nJudge Caproni questioned the juror in the robing room, a transcript shows. The juror acknowledged having contact with a person in the truck.\n“I know the one girl from the news,” the juror said. “That’s all I did, was say hello. I watch every morning from 4:30 to 7.”\n“She said: ‘Really? My family doesn’t even watch me on TV.’ ”\n“That was the extent of your conversation?” the judge asked.\n“Yes,” the juror replied.\nHe remained on the jury.\nAs for the juror who asked to be excused, there was no further word from her through the afternoon. But around 5:30 p.m., another note arrived from that juror.\n“Can I have a meeting with Judge Caproni after everyone is dismissed?” she wrote.\nThe judge told the jury that she had received a note, which would be taken up in the morning.","[""Each juror is entitled to his or her opinion.""]",1183,12,0.01183,0.00035999999999999997,0.01219
"WASHINGTON — In the hours after the San Bernardino rampage, President Obama reiterated the plea for “common sense gun safety laws” that he has made after virtually every mass shooting during his presidency.\nBut top White House advisers say they are still struggling to find a way for Mr. Obama to use his executive powers and tighten restrictions on gun sales, sidestepping a gridlocked Congress. While he has ordered officials to find ways for him to act unilaterally, aides said they have run into legal and political hurdles that make that difficult.\n“This policy-making process involves consideration of complex policy, legal and operational considerations, and the president’s team wants to make sure that everything we do in this area makes good common sense, is on strong legal footing, and can be effectively implemented,” said Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman. “This work is very much underway.”\nThe White House has focused its deliberations on an executive action that would detail who should be considered a high-volume gun dealer, a move that could expand background checks to a huge number of sales at gun shows, online, and elsewhere that now fall outside the law.\nBut taking that step would also open Mr. Obama to new charges that he is abusing his authority, even as the Supreme Court considers whether to review the legality of his actions to provide work permits and protection from deportation to five million undocumented immigrants.\nWhile some gun control advocates had hoped to see Mr. Obama announce new rules on Dec. 14, the anniversary of the 2012 school shootings in Newtown, Conn., there is virtually no chance of that happening. With White House lawyers still poring over the legal questions, officials said any announcement would be at least a month away.\nValerie Jarrett and other White House advisers have held a series of meetings in recent weeks with gun control advocates who are pushing for Mr. Obama to take strong executive action in the absence of any legislation from Congress. The president and Ms. Jarrett discussed the possibility of executive actions on guns during a meeting on Friday with Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot in the head during a mass shooting in 2011, and her husband, Mark Kelly.\nMr. Kelly said a detailed definition of a gun dealer would help catch some of the improper sales that are done off the books at gun shows. He said he spoke with the president about that idea early this year. “I’m optimistic that they will do something to improve the system,” Mr. Kelly said in an interview.\nAt the same time, opponents of any unilateral action by the president are preparing to mount political challenges and to file lawsuits if he acts on his own, without congressional involvement.\n“We stand ready to fight any backdoor attempts at gun control from the president,” said Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association’s lobbying arm, which has been monitoring the White House deliberations. “As he gets closer to the end of his term, he’s becoming more desperate to deliver a victory for gun control by executive fiat.”\nMr. Obama’s advisers believe that by defining the number of gun sales or other factors needed to qualify as a “high-volume” dealer, he could greatly increase the number of sales subject to such screenings, weeding out more of those barred from buying guns because of criminal offenses, domestic abuse or mental health issues.\nOther steps Mr. Obama’s aides are considering include broadening a provision that bars domestic abusers from buying guns, and giving the F.B.I. more time to run background checks. Taken together, the steps could require background checks for hundreds of thousands of more gun sales.\nBut the aides acknowledged in interviews that using the president’s executive authority to take these steps would pose a complex set of obstacles. For instance, changing the definition of “gun dealer” is more complicated than simply lowering the threshold for how many gun sales are required for one to be considered a high-volume dealer.\nWhite House officials said it is highly unlikely that Congress would be willing to finance the additional costs of enforcing the new definition or pay for additional background checks, which are conducted by federal law enforcement agencies.\nIn addition, officials said there was almost no accurate data about how many gun sales are made at gun shows or online by people who are not considered high-volume dealers. That makes it difficult to know how many people would be affected if Mr. Obama takes action to reinterpret the law.\nEven so, gun control advocates who have met with the White House say they are optimistic that Mr. Obama will move ahead with at least some of the steps under discussion.\n“I think they’ve arrived at a place where they’re committed to a set of executive orders,” said Pia Carusone, executive director of Americans for Responsible Solutions, the gun control group started by Ms. Giffords after her shooting. Ms. Carusone, who has attended several meetings with officials recently, said of Mr. Obama: “He doesn’t want to leave the White House without doing anything on guns.”\nThis is not the first time that Mr. Obama has considered using his executive powers to regulate the sale and use of guns in the face of congressional gridlock.\nIn 2013, after the slaughter of 26 children and staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., he urged Congress to pass tough new gun laws, including a background check for all gun purchases. Though Congress ultimately refused, a frustrated Mr. Obama went ahead on his own with executive action and imposed a set of 23 steps that were more modest in scope than what he is now considering.\nHis rising frustration has been evident for years in addressing the nation after each mass killing and calling on Congress to act.\nAfter the Sandy Hook shootings, he declared that “our hearts are broken today.” In the aftermath of the 2012 movie theater shooting in Colorado, he said he and the first lady, Michelle Obama, would “hug our girls a little tighter tonight.” And when community college students were killed in Oregon in October, his anger spilled over.\n“We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston,” he said in October. “It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun.”\nOfficials said the president and his aides recognized that the Republican-controlled Congress was unlikely to pass any new gun measures before Mr. Obama leaves office. But on Thursday, hiss spokesman insisted that the president remained committed to new gun laws if lawmakers would agree to pass them.\n“I assure you that the president’s passion for laws that would make it harder for individuals who shouldn’t get guns from getting them has not waned,” said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary.\nMr. Earnest repeatedly sought to place the blame for inaction squarely on Congress. He suggested that lawmakers should pass a law prohibiting people from buying guns if they have been placed on the country’s no-fly list of terrorism suspects.\n“Republicans can’t even explain why they actively oppose the passage of that law,” Mr. Earnest said, adding: “The president is determined to do everything he possibly can to try to make our country safer. And he certainly believes that members of Congress should have the same impulse.”","[""It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun.""]",1605,26,0.016050000000000002,0.00078,0.01683
"MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. — Just over six months ago, the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge, which spans the Cooper River from here to Charleston, became a momentary symbol of healing as thousands of black and white South Carolinians marched together after the massacre of nine black churchgoers.\nOn Monday night, downriver from the bridge, a much different spectacle unfolded on the Yorktown, a permanently docked aircraft carrier from World War II that is usually a tourist attraction. For an hour, it was the stage for Donald J. Trump’s latest blast, and perhaps most provocative one.\nSeizing on the anxieties of Americans after terrorist attacks by Islamic extremists in Paris and California, Mr. Trump, who is seeking the Republican Party’s presidential nomination, read a statement he had issued earlier in the day: “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on,” he said. His words brought hundreds of his supporters to their feet and provoked extended applause, as well as repeated disruptions from protesters throughout the rally.\nThis community’s summer of unity seemed to have given way to a winter of rancor. But among Mr. Trump’s fans, there were signs of unease with the idea of closing off the country to one religion, and even the candidate himself did not play the card with his usual self-assurance.\nMr. Trump seemed less than comfortable with his own statement, reading it word for word and not in his typical extemporaneous style. He noted that he had Muslim friends, and repeatedly tied his statement to dubious polling about Muslim attitudes that he thought could justify his case for barring an entire faith from emigrating to America.\nHe was far more enthusiastic in dishing out his usual fare: highlighting his poll numbers (while ignoring a new poll putting Senator Ted Cruz ahead in Iowa), promoting the size of his crowds and excoriating the news media and his opponents.\nIf Mr. Trump is not heartfelt about his views on Islam, that may not make his comments, in the eyes of many, any less pernicious.\nBut it was not hard to find people at the speech who echoed Mr. Trump’s views on stopping Muslims from entering the United States. Some invoked their alarm over Shariah law and others denigrated Islam as a cult.\nOne woman walked back to the press pen after the rally to assure reporters that a batch of protesters who had repeatedly interrupted Mr. Trump’s speech had not been Charlestonians; Charleston, she explained, had been voted the friendliest city in America.\nThe woman, Susan Kemmerlin of Charleston, said in the next breath that she supported Mr. Trump’s proposal because “you can’t look at a Muslim and tell if they’re a terrorist or friendly.”\nIn the long line that snaked hundreds of yards through the parking lot before the speech and in the one afterward that eased out along the vessel’s gangway, it was more common to encounter complex views that quickly skipped over Islam to a more honest accounting about why Mr. Trump’s call resonated: an all-too-real sense of dread about future attacks, partisan anger with President Obama’s administration for not doing more to control who enters the country, and an expectation that all migration be tightly controlled.\n“If you’re going to do it to one person, do it to all — make sure anyone coming into our country is vetted in the manner they need to be vetted,” said Tom Herold, a Mount Pleasant resident and Trump supporter.\n“His stance is just Muslims,” shot back his girlfriend, Michele Insinger, who also lives here and is no Trump fan. “It’s discrimination.”\nBut Mr. Herold continued, “There are certain times that are going to require certain necessary actions.” He added, “We’re heading towards a time that, if we don’t do something different, we may be in a precarious position as a country. However, I think everyone should have the same treatment.”\nA few steps away, Chris Arnold was leaving the first political event he ever attended — “it was kind of like a rock concert a little bit” — impressed with Mr. Trump. But Mr. Arnold was more taken with Mr. Trump’s contention that his wealth meant that he was not indebted to donors than with his stance on restricting Muslims. “That’s a little too much, a little over the edge,” Mr. Arnold said. “I just want to get the vetting process down. We need to redo that.”\nRandall Horres, who came to the rally with his family, indulged in some shouting at the protesters who remained in the parking lot after the event had concluded. But he said his outrage was more driven toward government than toward Muslims.\n“This thing in San Bernardino is proof positive of how broken our system is,” said Mr. Horres, who lives on John’s Island, S.C. He then quickly pivoted to the country’s border with Mexico, pointing to “a complete lack of faith in our government to do the vetting” of all immigrants.\nMr. Horres’ wife, Joanna, said the authorities should be able to stop those who come to the country intending to harm Americans. Asked how they could do that, she quickly responded: “That should be our government’s job to figure that out and protect us — and they’re not.”\nAnn Hunter, who drove with her husband and 8-year-old son about 100 miles from the Columbia, S.C., area to see and hear Mr. Trump, said she only wanted to tighten security and keep out Muslims who intended to inflict violence on people.\n“If they come to the country through regular means, the background checks are properly done and as far as we know there’s no tie to ISIS, they don’t hate America — just some common sense questions — then you can’t stop them all from coming here, that wouldn’t be right,” Ms. Hunter said.\nAt times, the gathering seemed little different than any other political rally in the South this time of year. The air was crisp and oyster roast-ready, the music was fit for a fraternity party — from yesterday’s “Shout” to today’s “Uptown Funk” — and the time-killing chatter ran more to the state of the University of South Carolina’s football program than to the Islamic State.\nBut it was hard to recall a moment since the weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks when fear was so foremost in voters’ minds.\nAfter nearly every attendee and protester had gone home, Muhiyidin d’Baha, a local organizer for Black Lives Matter, was striding across the darkened parking lot, the glow of the Ravenel Bridge one of the few sources of light.\nMr. d’Baha, whose father is Muslim and who is eyeing a State Senate seat, gestured at the bridge and in the direction of the city that helped propel slavery, the Civil War and more recently reconciliation. “You would think we’d learn from history,” he said.","[""Bridges are commonly used to span bodies of water and connect different areas.""]",1583,17,0.01583,0.00051,0.01634
"Carmelo Anthony carries an often unfair reputation as the jejune hoop star, the man with a smile almost too soft and a manner too easy.\nYeah, well, let’s give the Knick forward credit where due:\nLast April, Carmelo donned a black fedora, marched in the streets of his boyhood city, Baltimore, and spoke against both police and random street violence.\n“These are the streets that I walked when I was growing up,” Anthony said at the time. “As you can see, everybody wants justice right now, so we’ve got to be patient and start believing in our system. I know it’s hard to do that right now.”\nAnd now here Anthony is again appearing in the N.B.A.’s first-ever televised spot, slated to run Christmas Day, denouncing gun violence and, implicitly, calling for gun controls.\n“The gun should never be an option,” he says, his voiced joined with those of Chris Paul, Stephen Curry and Joakim Noah.\nAnthony had appeared with other celebrities in an earlier commercial, demanding a plan to control guns.\nThere is an undeniable powerful undercurrent to these anti-gun violence public service spots, the mothers of children executed in broad daylight, the father of the daughter blown away on a college campus. And it is only somewhat less powerful to listen as a growing number professional athletes (and semiprofessional college athletes) discover their social and cultural voices.\nEvery commercial consideration, after all, would speak to the prudence of their silence. Yet they extend their hands and touch such electrically volatile issues as gun violence.\nThis violence feels like an American math problem for which the answer forever contradicts the long row of sorrowful numbers. There were this many killed at a junior college, that many assassinated at that church, that many children shot down at that elementary school: the answer is never to rein in the easy availability of even the most baroque of death-dealing guns.\nTwenty years ago, the National Rifle Association and the brotherhood of the gun appeared on the defensive. A Democratic president had the association in his campaign cross hairs. Cities and counties and several states sued the gun companies, hoping to drive them into bankruptcy. A million moms marched on Washington.\nGun writers and ideologues worried aloud that the end was near, that within a generation the gun might become a museum curio.\nYeah, well, whatever.\nThe N.R.A. is more powerful than ever, its once ceaseless internal wars having long ago subsided. Those politicians who could fashion common sense harnesses for guns most often backpedal.\nThat said, of the professional sports, the N.B.A. and its players union have high-stepped most quickly into the 21st century. When an N.B.A. owner last year spoke in racist terms, the players bridled and bucked and threatened revolt. And the league’s commissioner, Adam Silver, moved quickly and eloquently to exile him.\nA few years ago football stars joined in the call for an end to gun violence. The Mets team last season — with pitcher Dillon Gee dissenting — spoke out for the same. This, however, is the first time a professional league and union have co-sponsored an anti-gun violence advertisement, along with Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun-control group underwritten by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\nThis October, LeBron James sat at home with his children when his phone brought news that a shooter in Oregon had gunned down eight students and a professor. That slaughter followed on the heels of the shooting death of a 5-month old girl in Cleveland, who was riding in her parents’ car when a bullet pierced the vehicle and her chest.\nJames felt compelled to speak up. He appeared the next day at practice, running his hand over his head as he spoke insistently to the cameras.\n“Obviously, you’re not going to be able to take every gun out, I don’t know how you can do that,” he said. “But if there’s some stipulations behind or some penalties, some big-time penalties or rules or regulations about carrying firearms, legal or illegal, people will second-guess themselves.”\nHis passion was heartfelt. However, the cultural chasm in this country on this question is such that that you wonder if any of these words will matter.\nPerhaps bearing witness is the beginning. Anthony knows this violence. He was born in Brooklyn, in the Red Hook projects. When Anthony was 8 years old, a beloved elementary school principal, Patrick Daly, 48, was shot down as he tried to fetch a wayward child in those same projects.\nSoon after, Anthony’s family moved to Baltimore, where Anthony would play in teenage basketball tournaments as armed drug-dealing toughs laid side bets. (Eleven years ago, Anthony stupidly allowed himself to get filmed in a video with, among others, a drug dealer threatening Baltimore residents to stop snitching; Anthony, who was then 20, said he thought he was just fooling around and apologized. He, in any case, gives many appearances of having matured.)\nFew could lay better claim than Anthony to understanding, instinctively, the psychological and corporeal toll taken by poverty, despair and gun violence. Last spring, he spoke to this.\n“The anger, the resentment, the neglect that our community feels right now, will not change overnight,” Anthony stated in an Instagram message at the time of the protest march. “Continue fighting for what you believe in. But remember it takes no time to destroy something.”\nAs much time, he might add, as it takes to squeeze a trigger","[""The gun should never be an option.""]",1279,9,0.01279,0.00026999999999999995,0.013059999999999999
"The National Basketball Association, alarmed by the death toll from shootings across the country, is stepping directly into the polarizing debate over guns, regulation and the Second Amendment with an unusual advertising campaign in partnership with one of the nation’s most aggressive advocates of stricter limits on firearm sales.\nIn a move with little precedent in professional sports, the N.B.A. is putting the weight of its multibillion-dollar brand and the prestige of its star athletes behind a series of television commercials calling for an end to gun violence.\nThe first ads, timed to reach millions of basketball fans during a series of marquee games on Christmas Day, focus on shooting victims and contain no policy recommendations. The words “gun control” are never mentioned.\nBut the organization that paid for them, Everytown for Gun Safety, has a robust and controversial agenda: It was founded by former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg specifically as a counterweight to the National Rifle Association, and the group also battles at the local, state and federal level to expand background checks for gun buyers, strengthen penalties for gun trafficking and ban gun sales to people convicted of domestic abuse.\nThe N.B.A.’s involvement suggests that a bloody year of gun deaths — in highly publicized mass shootings and countless smaller-scale incidents — may be spurring even some generally risk-averse, mainstream institutions to action.\nPlayers who appear in the first 30-second ad, which will run five times on Friday, speak in personal terms about the effects of gun violence on their lives. Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors describes hearing of a 3-year-old’s shooting: “My daughter Riley’s that age,” he says. Chris Paul of the Los Angeles Clippers recalls the advice he heeded as a child: “My parents used to say, ‘A bullet doesn’t have a name on it.’”\nThe N.B.A. said it held little internal debate about working with Mr. Bloomberg’s group. “We know far too many people who have been caught up in gun violence in this country,” said Kathleen Behrens, the league’s president of social responsibility and player programs. “And we can do something about it.”\nBut the decision may prove tricky for the league: While many of its teams are based in cities dominated by Democrats, a number of other teams — and millions of N.B.A. fans — hail from places where Mr. Bloomberg and his approach to guns are viewed with deep suspicion. Ms. Behrens said the league had not shown the ads to team owners, but added, “We’re not worried about any political implications.”\nThe Bloomberg-N.B.A. partnership was brokered by an unlikely figure: Spike Lee, a member of Everytown’s creative council, whose latest film, “Chi-Raq,” set on Chicago’s South Side, confronts gun violence with an unflinching eye.\nOver breakfast at the Loews Regency Hotel in Manhattan in November, not long before the movie was released earlier this month, Mr. Lee proposed the idea for the ads to John Skipper, the president of ESPN, who then took it to Adam Silver, the N.B.A.’s commissioner. Mr. Lee insisted on the participation of Everytown, with which he collaborated on a protest march down Broadway after the film’s New York premiere.\nIn an interview, he sounded many of the themes that Mr. Bloomberg himself has emphasized in the past, saying it was time for “common sense anti-gun laws.”\n“But because of the N.R.A., politicians and the gun manufacturers, we’re dying under that tyranny,” Mr. Lee said. Reciting a statistic from Everytown, he added: “Ninety Americans are dying every day because of the N.R.A., gun manufacturers, and politicians willing to run you under the table.”\nMr. Bloomberg’s interventionist policies as mayor and his left-leaning tactics on guns have earned the vitriol of gun-rights advocates, who mocked him with TV ads as an out-of-touch elitist last year and attacked him again during a Republican presidential debate in August.\n“Bloomberg tries to ban your snack food, your sodas and, most of all, your guns,” declared one ad paid for by the N.R.A. “Hey, Bloomberg: Keep your politics in New York. And keep your hands off our guns and our freedom.”\nBut the commercials to be broadcast on Christmas represent the evolution of Mr. Bloomberg’s strategy for changing the nation’s gun culture and the rules that govern it.\nAfter blasting the N.R.A. for years, and seeking to use his personal fortune to punish lawmakers who ran afoul of his legislative goals (“We’ve got to make them afraid of us,” he once said), Mr. Bloomberg is emphasizing the experiences of gun victims, building grass-roots networks in states, developing partnerships with well-known figures and crafting a message that focuses on the noncontroversial goal of ending gun violence, rather than the divisive aim of “gun control.”\nJohn Feinblatt, a former top mayoral aide to Mr. Bloomberg who is president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said the group appreciated that Americans would first need to understand the depth and breadth of the damage caused by gun violence before they would coalesce around any set of solutions. (The ad is being produced not by Everytown’s political lobby but by an affiliated educational nonprofit.)\n“This,” Mr. Feinblatt said of the N.B.A. ads, “is clearly about educating the public.”\nBesides N.B.A. players, the ads feature survivors of shootings and relatives of those killed by guns, including Andy Parker, whose daughter, Alison, a television reporter in Virginia, was shot to death in the middle of a live broadcast by a former co-worker. Everytown for Gun Safety paid for the production of the commercials, and the league donated time that it controls during games on ABC and ESPN, which will broadcast the ads.\nPro athletes and teams have spoken out in different ways on gun violence before. Mets players and front-office staff posed for a photograph in June wearing orange T-shirts, the color of gun safety, in a display organized by Everytown. In 2013, a group of former N.F.L. players advocated tougher gun laws in an ad organized by a different group financed by Mr. Bloomberg.\nBut until now, no major sports league has lent its name and logo to such an effort.\nFor the N.B.A., whose public-service partnerships have tended to involve groups like Unicef, Habitat for Humanity and the Boys and Girls Clubs, the foray into guns is a significant departure. But it reflects a political awakening inside the league that is led not by its executives, but by its players.\nIn 2012, members of the Miami Heat, including LeBron James, wore hooded sweatshirts in solidarity with Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager shot to death in Florida by a neighborhood watch volunteer. In 2014, Mr. James and other N.B.A. players wore shirts during pregame warm-ups that said, “I can’t breathe” — the words uttered by Eric Garner, a black man from Staten Island, just before he died when a police offer put him in a chokehold.\nAnd in April, Carmelo Anthony of the Knicks marched with protesters in his hometown of Baltimore after the slaying of Freddie Gray, a young black man who died while in police custody. Mr. Anthony is one of the players who speaks in the new ads.\nHarry Edwards, the sociologist who, as leader of the Olympic Project for Human Rights, helped organize the raised-fist protest by Tommy Smith and John Carlos during the 1968 Summer Games, said too much gun violence was “tied into this masculine mystique — having to do with being respected as a man, or tough as a man.”\n“When Steph Curry or Carmelo Anthony are saying, ‘No, there’s nothing masculine about that; the violence has to stop,’ these are the people that young African-American males around the country are identifying with,” Mr. Edwards said. “It has more impact than if the president had said it.”\nFor a number of N.B.A. players, gun violence was and remains an intimate fact of life — one that some said they hoped to spare the next generation.\nJoakim Noah of the Chicago Bulls, who grew up in New York City and also appears in the new commercials, recalled a searing childhood memory in statements that he and the other players provided in conjunction with the new ads.\n“I’ll never forget playing basketball in a park with some kids, and a young woman approached me in tears, and told me that her brother had been shot and killed on that same court a year earlier,” Noah said. “Ultimately, it’s about saving lives. There’s just no room for gun violence.”","[""A bullet doesn't have a name on it.""]",1929,11,0.01929,0.00032999999999999994,0.019620000000000002
"A pivotal vote on Muslim immigration split the Republican presidential field in the Senate—with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) voting to continue to allow large-scale Muslim immigration and Senator Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) voting to pause Muslim immigration.\nThe amendment, offered Sen. Rand Paul, would have suspended visa issuances to more than 30 Muslim countries with active Jihadist populations. Graham and Rubio were both members of the Gang of Eight, which proposed legislation that would expand Muslim immigration, and Paul and Cruz were both opponents of the Gang of Eight bill.\nGraham and Rubio’s vote against curbing Muslim migration follows the attack in San Bernardino. The male suspect, Syed Farook, is the son of Pakistani immigrants; and the female suspect, Farook’s wife, Tashfeen Malik, was a Pakistani native. According to CNN, the two met, “when he [Farook] had gone to Saudi Arabia in 2013 on the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca that Muslims are required to take at last once in their lifetime. It was during this trip that he met Malik, a native of Pakistan who came to the United States in July 2014 on a ‘fiancée visa’ and later became a lawful permanent resident.”\nSen. Paul’s amendment failed 89-10, with only nine other Senators joining Paul’s bid for a halt to the large-scale distribution of visas to nations with jihadist populations. The nine others supporting Paul’s amendment were Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), Sen. David Vitter (R-LA), Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY), Mike Enzi, Sen. Mark Kirk (R-IL), Sen. Jerry Moran (R-KS), Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL) and Senator Ted Cruz.\nMajority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Republican Whip Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX), and GOP Conference Chair Sen. John Thune (R-SD) voted against the amendment. Thune’s vote is particularly notable as the GOP conference is in charge of the Republican Party’s messaging in the Senate.\nAs The Hill newspaper writes:\nPaul’s amendment would place a ‘pause’ on issuing visas to more than 30 countries, that the Kentucky Republican said are ‘at a high risk for exporting terrorists.’ It would also require that individuals from countries that participate in the Visa Waiver Program to either wait 30 days before coming to the United States or go through enhanced background and security checks, as well as requiring the government to perform additional screening on any admitted refugees.\nAccording to Rasmussen, 65 percent of conservative voters think the correct number of refugees to admit from the entire Middle East is zero. According to a Kellyanne Conway survey, a majority of Americans want a pause on all immigration from everywhere in the world.\nUnder current immigration policy, the U.S. issues about 280,000 visas annually to temporary and permanent Muslim migrants— including more than a 100,000 green cards each year.\nGreen card holders are given lifetime work permits and residency, welfare, and ultimately become full voting citizens of the United States. As the Senate Immigration Subcommittee has documented, over the next five years the U.S. will permanently resettle nearly 700,000 Muslim migrants on green cards— or a population larger than the size of Washington D.C. According to Pew Research, only 11 percent of Muslim Americans identify as Republican or leaning-Republican, making them one of the most reliable Democrat voting blocs in the country.\nRubio’s opposition to Sen. Rand Paul’s effort to pause mass Muslim migration is consistent with Rubio’s voting record. Earlier this year, Rubio introduced an immigration expansion bill known as the I-Squared bill which would substantially expand immigration. That bill is backed by Mark Zuckerberg’s immigration lobbying group, as well as the lobbying firm chaired by Rupert Murdoch, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, and Disney’s Bob Iger. It has also been endorsed by Oracle, whose billionaire co-founder Larry Ellison is helping to fund Rubio’s campaign. GOP frontrunner Donald Trump has said, “Senator Rubio works for the lobbyists, not for Americans. That is why he is receiving more money from Silicon Valley than any other candidate in this race. He is their puppet.”\nRubio also co-authored the 2013 La-Raza backed amnesty and immigration expansion plan. Conservative Review’s Daniel Horowitz has detailed:\nRubio’s [2013] Bill Would Have Opened Floodgates to Islamic Refugees”. Horowitz explained that the bill would have, “dramatically weakened the precautions against fraudulent asylum petitions by, among other things, eliminating the time constraints on filing those applications… [and] in totality… would have created endless avenues for this president to bring in an unlimited numbers of Islamic immigrants from the most volatile corners of the world.\nIn recent weeks, Rubio has reiterated his support for bringing in Syrian refugees. In fact, in an interview on Fox News with Neil Cavuto, Rubio expressed his support for bringing in both very young and very old refugees, who will likely become instant public charges on the U.S. taxpayer. “Common sense still applies,” Rubio told Cavuto in his explanation about which migrants from terror-prone Muslim regions he would admit into the country. “If it’s a seven-year-old child, if it’s a 90-year-old widow, if it’s a well-known Chaldean priest, these are people you can vet.”\nIn a Thursday letter to administration officials, Sens. Ted Cruz and Jeff Sessions offered an opposite theory, saying that terrorists have proven they can not only recruit and groom young Muslim migrants, but the future children of Muslim migrants allowed in the country. They cited the Chattanooga shooter who recently murdered four marines and a Navy Sailor as being an example of a terrorist attack caused by immigration. Like Rubio’s hypothetical seven year-old Muslim migrants he says “common sense” tells you to let in, the Chattanooga shooter came here from Kuwait at around the age of six.\nOnce young Syrian refugees have citizenship, they then have the right to bring in their relatives as well. The elderly widow, to take Rubio’s example, would be able to bring in her children, while also receiving costly medical and nursing care from U.S. taxpayers. Rubio has previously said he’d “hate” to block funding for Obama’s refugee program— which leaders are planning to push through by December 11th. As a result, Obama would not only be able to bring in the young and old Muslim migrants favored by Rubio, but the middle-aged Muslim migrants as well. Moreover, with his vote on Thursday, Rubio voted to continue immigration from not just Syria but every Muslim country in the world.\nIn their joint letter, Sessions and Cruz explained the dangers this would pose:\nWe are dealing with an enemy that has shown it is not only capable of bypassing U.S. screening, but of recruiting and radicalizing Muslim migrants after their entry to the United States. The recruitment of terrorists in the U.S. is not limited to adult migrants, but to their young children and to their U.S.-born children – which is why family immigration history is necessary to understand the nature of the threat… Congress is days away from consideration of an omnibus year-end funding bill that would set the U.S. on an autopilot path to approve green cards, asylee, and refugee status to approximately 170,000 migrants from Muslim countries during the next year.\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"Donald Trump has now made clear that the thrust of his campaign will not be conservatism. It will instead be populism and nationalism.\nFor those looking for a governing philosophy of The Donald, his checkered political history has provided little guidance. He’s seemingly endorsed single-payer healthcare; he’s said he rejects Obamacare. He’s blasted money in politics; he’s talked about the necessity for government use of eminent domain to help private parties. He’s ripped overregulation of capitalistic enterprises; he’s talked about tariffs on foreign goods. Trump isn’t conservative, and he never was.\nSenator Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Trump’s chief challenger in the next primary state of South Carolina, is utilizing that lack of coherent conservatism as a club against Trump. His latest ad blitz features a small boy holding a Trump action figure, shouting, “Look, I got the Trump action figure! He pretends to be a Republican!” He then uses the action figure to brag about giving money to Democrats and engaging in eminent domain.\nTrump won’t be able to trump Cruz on conservatism. So now he’s making clear that he isn’t running a conservative campaign – he’s running a nationalist and populist campaign. His enemies include both Republicans and conservatives:\nRemember, it was the Republican Party, with the help of Conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, BUT DIDN’T KEEP THEM! Hi DT\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 11, 2016\nAccording to Trump, then, conservatives helped bamboozle the Republican base, along with the Republican establishment. So the establishment sucks – and so do conservatives.\nTrump’s move here is calculated. He’s going to campaign as a post-ideological candidate. All he wants, as he said in his next tweet, is to “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.” If that means bigger government, that means bigger government.

He cares about America, and that’s enough – he wants to restore American greatness, and that’s enough. How will he do it? He just will. And he won’t be held back by any conservative vision of a small government nation founded on individual liberty. Sometimes he’ll do conservative things. Sometimes he won’t. But he’ll act with “common sense” and “do what needs to be done.”\nNone of this should be comforting for conservatives, but Trump doesn’t mean for it to be. He’s hoping that there are enough aphilosophic Americans to push him forward to victory.\nHe may be right.\nEven if he is, that’s no victory for conservative principles. As Trump says, that’s not a priority.\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News, Editor-in-Chief of DailyWire.com, and The New York Times bestselling author, most recently, of the book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).

"In a remarkable Sunday edition of The Boston Globe, the paper’s editors go all in for the fight to block GOP frontrunner Donald Trump from winning the Republican Party’s nomination.\n“The GOP Must Stop Trump,” blares the title of the paper’s Sunday editorial. In addition to the editorial, the editors crafted a fake “front page in Donald Trump’s America” edition of the Boston Globe dated Sunday April 9th, 2017.\nIn their editorial, the editors seem to propose that Party elites use Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) as a cat’s-paw to deny Trump the nomination, then ultimately give the nomination to someone who is not currently running — such as Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) or Mitt Romney.\nAlthough the paper seems to advocate giving Mitt Romney the nomination, the paper endorsed Barack Obama over Romney in the 2012 election. In 2016, the Globe endorsed Hillary Clinton and John Kasich.\nThe paper’s editorial board argues that Trump is no different than the “demagogic strongmen” who have risen to power throughout history. The editors make this comparison while seemingly unaware of the fact that it is President Obama who has used unprecedented executive powers to rewrite and nullify immigration laws, which have put thousands of American lives at risk and have allowed criminal cartels to roam free. The paper writes of Trump:\nIt is easy to find historical antecedents. The rise of demagogic strongmen is an all too common phenomenon on our small planet. And what marks each of those dark episodes is a failure to fathom where a leader’s vision leads, to carry rhetoric to its logical conclusion. The satirical front page of this section attempts to do just that, to envision what America looks like with Trump in the White House.\nThe “satirical front page” and the editorial itself attack Trump’s signature policy positions on trade and immigration. However, data from exit polls suggest that the Republican electorate has been receptive to Trump’s positions on these issues.\nFor instance, Wisconsin’s exit polls showed that 7 out of 10 GOP Wisconsin voters support a temporary pause Muslim migration — a position that has not been articulated by any candidate aside from Trump. Similarly, a majority of Wisconsin Republicans (54%) said that foreign trade deals take away U.S. jobs. Again, Trump is the only candidate in the GOP field campaigning against globalist trade pacts and arguing that the trade deals of recent decades have not benefited American workers.\nTrump’s campaign has declared Sen. Cruz has consistently opposed efforts to crack down on Chinese currency cheating and has argued that Obama’s fast track trade authority would help “to win a fair deal for the American worker.” Cruz has also stated that the loss of U.S. jobs in manufacturing and other economic sectors is not the result of our nation’s trade deals. “Working men and women have been hammered across this country, but it hasn’t been because of free trade,” Cruz said in a June radio interview defending his earlier vote for fast track trade authority.\nAmong the editors’ many predictions blazed across the front page of the satirical Boston Globe edition, some of the most notable include: predictions of an imminent trade war, predictions about the disastrous economic impact for U.S. employers caused by enforcing the nation’s immigration laws, and predictions about the blacklisting of Megyn Kelly.\n- In a 2017 “article” titled “Market sinks as trade war looms,” the editors attack Trump for their imagined future trade war, which they believe will occur as a result of his plan to implement “tariffs as high as 45 percent for all Chinese imports.” The editors make no mention of the fact that Ronald Reagan implemented a 45% tariff on Japanese motorcycles to save the Harley-Davidson Motor Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The paper also does not mention the fact that in 2012, Mitt Romney argued that a trade war is already occurring and the U.S. is losing. “There’s one [i.e. a trade war] going on right now, which we don’t know about it. It’s a silent one. And they’re winning,” Romney said at the time. While the publication is worried about the hypothetical consequences of standing up to foreign cheating, they seem unconcerned about the actual documented consequences of not standing up to illicit trading practices. Between 2001 to 2013, the U.S. lost 3.2 million jobs to China due to the growing trade deficit.\n- The fake front page of The Boston Globe also seems to indicate the editors’ general opposition to cracking down on sanctuary cities, which have resulted in the death, rape, abuse, child sexual exploitation, maiming, and permanent disfigurement of thousands of American citizens. The editors warn that Trump’s vow to defund sanctuary cities in order protect American lives will spark protests that would inconvenience “scores of attendees at an elite Harvard/MIT tech fest” by forcing them to “evacuate Kendall Square and take the MBTA’s #1 Bus across the Charles River to alternate site in Boston.”\n- The editors sound the alarm over what would happen if America ceases its longstanding policy of refusing to enforce our immigration laws. The editors warn that should the nation enforce the Congressionally-passed immigration laws, dishes in San Francisco restaurants will go unwashed:\nAlready in California, armed ICE agents confronted 30 illegal strawberry pickers on a Santa Barbara County farm and bused them to a detention center to await prosecution and a government chartered flight back to Mexico. State officials held a press conference shortly after the raid to express concern about the economic impact if “dishes go unwashed in the kitchens of San Francisco restaurants and if our $3 billion strawberry crop is ultimately left to rot.\nThe editors make no mention of the fact that American citizens wash dishes in every city in every state all across this country. Nor do the editors mention that dishwasher and busboy positions have traditionally been an entrance for young Americans to make their way into the workforce. Deporting illegal labor would thus open these jobs to American citizens, produce higher wages, and help unemployed black and Hispanic youth, currently dogged by high unemployment, join the workforce.\nYet not only do the editors attack the GOP frontrunner and his policies but they also attack his supporters. In their editorial, the editors suggest Trump supporters are violent and unpredictable, warning that if Trump is denied the nomination, “who knows what Trump’s fervent backers are capable of if emboldened by the defeat of their strongman at the hands of the hated party elite.”\nThe editors’ fears of violence rings hollow, as the recent violent protests in Chicago were carried out by anti-Trump, far-left radicals. Moreover, while the editors are left imagining what kind of action Trump supporters “are capable of,” the editors seem uninterested in the actual violence that is occurring all across America as a result of our immigration system. The liberal-leaning Migration Policy Institute estimates that are nearly one million illegal aliens in the United States with criminal convictions (820,000). This figure does not include an estimation of the total crimes committed by illegal aliens but only those who have been successfully arrested, tried, and convicted.\nThe editors go on to suggest that Party elites should use Cruz to prevent Trump from receiving 1,237 delegates but should then give the nomination to a candidate who is not currently in the race:\nIf the party can muster the courage to reject its first-place finisher, rejecting the runner-up should be even easier. The Republican Party’s standard deserves to be hoisted by an honorable and decent man, like Romney or Ryan, elected on the convention floor. It is better to lose with principle than to accept a dangerous deal from a demagogue.\nThe editors’ analysis seems to comport with the analysis of Pat Caddell and others who have suggested that Sen. Cruz’s candidacy is an essential ingredient necessary for the Establishment to choose their preferred nominee.\nIronically, the editors bash Trump as being “anti-immigrant” for his America first platform — but then seem to wonder why he’s so popular in the first place:\nAt some point, after the election, Republicans will also need to ask themselves some tough questions about how their actions and inactions made the party vulnerable to Trump. After all, a candidate spewing anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, authoritarian rhetoric didn’t come out of nowhere; the Tea Party has been strong enough long enough that someone like him shouldn’t be a surprise. Chasing short-term political gains, the GOP missed a lot of chances to fight the hateful currents that now threaten to overwhelm it.\nThe talking point that Americans are anti-immigrant or hostile to immigrants is the typical slander employed by the proponents of mass migration like Hillary Clinton, George Soros, and Paul Ryan, who believe there should be no pause or cessation in record migration even if it means more crime, overcrowded schools, and depressed wages.\nThe editors do not seem to consider the possibility that Trump’s popularity stems from the fact that the Republican electorate is tired of its leaders taking marching orders from cosmopolitan commentariats like The Boston Globe, who see no problem with the social, economic, and cultural effects of mass migration.\nIndeed, while GOP Party elites have a long history of pushing trade and immigration policies opposed by its base, Trump himself has explained that his success is a result of his position on those two issues. In his victory speech following his thumping of open borders advocate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Trump said unequivocally that those issues sparked his success from day one of his campaign:\nWe came down the escalator, and it was about trade and it was about borders. And what happened is pretty quickly after that – and we were, we shot right up. I shot right to the top of the polls, and have been leading in the polls almost from the beginning, without fail.\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"WASHINGTON (AP) — Voters will “rise up” in opposition if Republican power brokers try to take the presidential nomination away from Donald Trump or Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) at the GOP convention this summer, Sarah Palin said Thursday in a wide-ranging interview.\nThe 2008 vice presidential nominee told The Associated Press that GOP voters have the right to decide the party’s nominee and will rebel if House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) or some other “white knight” is chosen at a contested convention. Ryan said this week he will not seek or accept the nomination.\nPalin said voters know better than to be fooled by party leaders.\n“How dare they?” Palin asked, denouncing “arrogant political operatives who underestimate the wisdom of the people.”\nIf party leaders try to intervene at the July convention, “we will rise up and say our vote does count, our activism does count,” she said.\nPalin said she is not convinced by pledges from party leaders that the GOP nominee will be chosen from among those running for president.\n“There are some snakes in there,” she said of party leaders. “I’ve had to deal with the political machinery my whole career.”\nPalin said she plans to attend the convention in Cleveland, but she conceded that she may have to “invite myself to the party.”\n“I can’t see any of them inviting me,” she said of party leaders. “I think they are afraid of what I would say.”\nPalin, who has endorsed Trump, said she is confident he will win the GOP nomination, but said she can support Cruz if he emerges as the nominee.\nShe said she backs Trump because he is “so reasonable and so full of common sense and knows that for America to be great again we have to develop our natural resources” such as oil and natural gas.\nWhile some GOP leaders worry that Trump’s disparaging comments about women, minorities and others have him struggling in the polls with key voter blocs, Palin said Trump would be the GOP’s strongest nominee. Trump has created the “big tent” that party leaders have long been seeking, she said, citing the billionaire businessman’s appeal to independents and “blue dog Democrats” in the South and other rural areas.\nPalin said she was not concerned about some of Trump’s comments about women, saying she has known him for years “and I know the respect he has for women.”\nTrump “doesn’t have high-paid consultants and pollsters and spinsters trying to spin him into something he’s not,” she said. “He takes advice from strong, confident women in his life, like his wife and daughter.”\nWhile Palin said she could support Cruz, she said it was “unfortunate that he has people around him who are not truthful. I sure want to believe it’s the people around him and not Cruz as a person who would flip-flop on so many issues,” including trade and immigration.\n“He was there at the border incentivizing illegal families coming on over the border with gift baskets of soccer balls and teddy bears and now he says he was never for amnesty. Yes, you were, dude, come on,” Palin said.\nThe former Alaska governor was in Washington to promote a new documentary that seeks to debunk what it calls myths and hype about human-caused global warming. The movie, “Climate Hustle,” questions whether there is a genuine scientific consensus about global warming and features more than 30 scientists who reject mainstream climate science.\nPalin said she wants viewers “to feel empowered to ask questions about what is being fed them by the scientific community.” The movie opens May 2.\nOn other topics, Palin said Ryan has failed as House speaker because the House has not approved a federal budget as promised. And while she said she does not regret staying out of the presidential race, she did not rule out a possible presidential bid in the future.\n“If I can trust that the electorate is as fed up as I am with the shenanigans and the corruption and the crony capitalism … and can handle a true outsider, then you know that the time would be right” to run for president, she said.\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) slammed Donald Trump as “no different from politically correct leftist elites” in a response to Trump’s comments criticizing North Carolina’s new transgender bathroom law.\nDuring an appearance in NBC’s Today Show Trump commented, “Leave it the way it is. North Carolina, what they’re going through with all the business that’s leaving, all of the strife — and this is on both sides. Leave it the way it is.” He continued, “There has been so little trouble. And the problem with what happened in North Carolina is the strife and the economic — I mean, the economic punishment that they’re taking.”\nCruz issued the following response to Trump’s comments:\nDonald Trump is no different from politically correct leftist elites. Today, he joined them in calling for grown men to be allowed to use little girls’ public restrooms. As the dad of young daughters, I dread what this will mean for our daughters – and for our sisters and our wives. It is a reckless policy that will endanger our loved ones.\nYet Donald stands up for this irresponsible policy while at the same time caving in on defending individual freedoms and religious liberty. He has succumbed to the Left’s agenda, which is to force Americans to leave God out of public life while paying lip service to false tolerance.\nThis is not real tolerance. The Left wants to force its belief system onto Americans across the country and silence people of faith in the public square. Unsurprisingly, Donald Trump is all too eager to join them. This simply confirms that the same man who favored partial-birth abortion and still supports public funding for Planned Parenthood will sacrifice principle on the altar of political correctness. Trump will not defeat political correctness. Today he bowed to it.\nNorth Carolina since Gov. Pat McCrory signed the bill into law that prohibits “cities from allowing transgender individuals to use public bathrooms for the sex they identify as.” McCrory spokesman Ricky Diaz said of Trump’s comments, “Where the governor disagrees with Mr. Trump is that bathroom and shower facilities in our schools should be kept separate and special accommodations made when needed. It’s just common sense.”\nRep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) weighed in on Trump’s comments from the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday: “Who are they trying to protect in North Carolina? They’re trying to protect innocent kids that cannot protect themselves.” He continued, “Why condemn North Carolina when they’re just trying to protect the privacy of girls?”\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) accused GOP frontrunner Donald Trump of “telling us he’s lying to us” after Trump aides told RNC leaders that their candidate will moderate his message.\n“Donald is a New York liberal who is pretending to be a conservative to try to fool Republican primary voters,” Cruz told radio host Mark Levin and his listeners on Thursday. Levin prompted the statement when he referred to senior Trump aide Paul Manafort’s comments in a private meeting and asking Cruz, “Who the hell is Donald Trump?”\nTrump’s senior aide, Paul Manafort, gave Republican National Committee members a new vision of a more moderate Trump to come: “The part that he’s been playing is evolving into the part that now you’ve been expecting, but he wasn’t ready for, because he had first to complete the first phase. The negatives will come down. The image is going to change.” The Associated Press reported on the meeting after obtaining a recording of the closed-door exchange.\nOn Levin’s show, Cruz gave Trump “a little bit of credit” for being candid: “He’s telling us he’s lying to us.” Trump has repeatedly branded Cruz as “lyin’ Ted.” Cruz’s campaign slogan is “TrusTed.”\nCruz hit on the “lyin’ Trump” theme again on Friday, telling rally-goers in Williamsport, Pennsylvania that Trump is “trying to fool gullible voters,” according to reporter Betsy Klein. He repeated the statement that Trump is “telling us he’s lying to us.”\nDuring the Levin interview, Cruz brought up words from Trump supporter Ben Carson and reports of Trump’s off the record meeting with the New York Times, calling it all “an act, a show.” Cruz accused Trump of telling the NYT that “he’s not going to build a wall, he’s not going to deport the people here illegally.”\nTrump supporter and former presidential candidate himself, Ben Carson, told the RNC members in Florida that Trump is “trying to moderate. He’s getting better,” reported the AP.\nCruz told Levin and his listeners, “If you’re tired of being lied to you oughta at least listen to it when Donald Trump tells us he’s lying to us and that’s why I think the right thing for a voter to do is not listen to campaign rhetoric, but instead look for a record. You want someone who’ll stand up to immigration? Ask who led the fight against the Gang of 8 amnesty plan and led the effort to defeat it in congress. I was leading that effort against amnesty when Donald Trump was funding the Gang of 8 amnesty plan.”\nLevin, who has endorsed Cruz, played a clip of Trump’s Today Show comments criticizing North Carolina’s new transgender bathroom bill.\nCruz commented, “Donald Trump is explicitly agreeing with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. They have the same views on religious liberty.”\nHe said that as a father it’s just “common sense” that he doesn’t want grown men in the bathroom with his little girls. Cruz called it the “political correctness that we have seen the last seven years.”\nHe made similar comments during an interview on the Glenn Beck radio program, “It is only the lunacy of political correctness –if he had fired Curt Schilling—for making the rather obvious point, that we shouldn’t allow grown adult men strangers alone in a bathroom with little girls.”\nLevin then pointed to a clip in the Today Show interview in which Trump said he agreed when asked if he believes in raising taxes on the wealthy. Levin commented that talk of taxing the wealthy usually means the middle class. He then asked Cruz, “Raising taxes on the ‘wealthy,’ doesn’t that go against his own proposed tax plan?”\nCruz accused Trump of not knowing what’s in his own tax plan: “He hired some staffer to write a tax plan to pretend to be conservative. It’s not a very well thought out tax plan, he doesn’t know the details.” He went on to say Trump supported President Obama’s Wall Street bailout and accused Trump of being in favor of socialized healthcare.\nIn February, Trump posted a lengthy message to Facebook refuting accusations that he holds positions that are not conservative. In it he called Cruz “a totally unstable individual” and “the single biggest liar I’ve ever come across.”\nCruz brought up Trump’s stated intention to amend the pro-life plank of the Republican platform and “even today supports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood.”\n“These are the views of a big government, New York liberal,” Cruz asserted. He also claimed “Donald Trump wrote the checks to fund” Obamacare.\n“If you’re tired of being lied to, it doesn’t make any sense to support the guy who is blatantly lying to you and laughing about it,” Cruz claimed. “He is making fun of us right now, the American people. He thinks we’re gullible and he thinks if he yells and screams and curses and uses language that insults everybody that somehow people will think he’s really a conservative…”\nEarlier in the show Levin asked Cruz to tell Trump to come on the radio show after two to three months of absence if the candidates cross paths on the campaign trail. “It’s now been 43 days since the last debate,” said Cruz. The Texas senator accused Trump of avoiding Levin’s show because Levin “won’t kiss his behind,” but will “ask difficult questions.”\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) hit the campaign trail in both Pennsylvania and Indiana on Saturday bringing his campaign message to Pittsburgh, Plainfield and Indianapolis with a new joke based on Trump’s criticism of North Carolina’s new transgender bathroom law.\nAt Cruz’s Saturday evening rally at the Boone County Fairground in Indianapolis he joked: “Even if Donald Trump dresses up as Hillary Clinton, he shouldn’t be usin’ the girls restroom.”\nCruz started on with his speech, “The third critical issue on this election…” then stopped to revisit the joke.\nBy the way, I apologize for that image, it’s going to haunt you at night as you sleep.\nDonald in a bright blue pants suit.\nBut let me just say, to Jimmy Fallon and the Tonight Show, please give us that image.\nThe crowd erupted with laughter. “I’m gonna stop goin’ down this road,” Cruz remarked.\nHe carried on with the remainder of his stump speech to the Indianapolis crowd.\nOn Thursday Trump told NBC’s Today Show viewers, “North Carolina did something — it was very strong — and they’re paying a big price,” then argued, “Leave it the way it is.” Trump added, “There has been so little trouble. And the problem with what happened in North Carolina is the strife and the economic — I mean, the economic punishment that they’re taking.”\nCruz accused Trump of joining the “PC police” in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Friday. “This is political correctness on steroids. It is basic common sense that a grown adult man, a stranger, should not be alone in a restroom with little girls. As a father of two young daughters, I can say unequivocally that’s a terrible idea. That is not a matter of right versus left or Democrat versus Republican.

"The day after news broke that the presidential campaigns of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich agreed to split their efforts between Indiana on the one hand and Oregon and New Mexico on the other, Cruz confirmed that the two campaigns indeed “had conversations” and agreed to the strategy to divide and prevent GOP frontrunner Donald Trump from securing the nomination before the Republican National Convention.\nCruz revealed from a Monday morning press conference in Borden, Indiana:\nWe had conversations and both campaigns agreed to focus our energies. We’re focusing our energy on the state of Indiana and Gov. Kasich is focusing his energies elsewhere.\nI think that is a decision, an allocation of resources that makes a lot of sense and it is devoted to the principle of beating Hillary Clinton in November and turning this country around.\nSeparate statements from the Kasich and Cruz campaigns were released on Sunday night letting Americans know that Sen. Cruz would focus on campaigning in the May 3 primary state of Indiana, and Gov. Kasich would focus on campaigning in Oregon and New Mexico. Both candidates seek to deny Trump the 1,237 delegates needed to secure the Republican nomination on a first ballot at the convention.\nOne reporter at the Monday Cruz press conference commented that some are seeing the move as a sign of desperation from both the Cruz and Kasich campaigns, “And you can imagine Donald Trump is going to use that today as he talks about what’s being done.”\nCruz responded:\nListen, I don’t doubt that Donald Trump is going to scream and yell and curse and insult and probably cry and whine some as well, that has been Donald’s pattern. Now I recognize everyone got all excited because last week Donald won his home state.\nTrump responded on Sunday night with both Tweets and a full statement, calling the move an act of collusion and “desperation.”\nCruz cited his “landslide” wins in Utah, Colorado, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, where he said he won 1.3 million votes.\nI won more votes in the state of Wisconsin, than Donald Trump did in New York.\nSo yes, I agree, there is desperation on the Trump side and the reason Donald Trump is desperate is because it is now abundantly clear, nobody’s getting to 1,237.\nAsked if the Cruz-Kasich agreement is a “Hail Mary,” Cruz repeated this and continued:\nIt is abundantly clear that nobody is getting to 1,237.\nWe are headed to a contested convention. and at a contested convention, Donald Trump is in real trouble. Why? Because he cannot earn the support of a majority of the delegates elected by the people. Donald has had consistently a hard ceiling of about 40 percent that he can’t break. Donald has been a minority candidate, a fringe candidate. Now he benefitted early in the race by having a multitude of opponents where the opposition to Donald was diffuse, but what we have seen happening over the last month is the Republican Party uniting behind our campaign. Indeed of the 17 candidates who started this race, five have now endorsed our campaign: Rick Perry, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Carly Fiorina. We are seeing the full spectrum of the Republican Party uniting.\nCruz then spoke of the “Hoosier State. There is a common sense sensibility about this great state. You’ve had leaders like Gov. Mitch Daniels, like Gov. Mike Pence who roll up their sleeves and solve problems, who understand that when you cut taxes and lift regulations the result is small businesses grow and jobs expand. We need a President in the spirit of Mitch Daniels and Mike Pence.”\nIndiana Gov. Mike Pence has yet to endorse in the race. Pence met with both Cruz and Trump last week. He was scheduled to meet with Kasich as well, but that was reported before news broke of the Cruz-Kasich agreement.\nMonday morning Trump Tweeted accusing Cruz and Kasich of collusion:\nLyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 25, 2016\nOne of the final questions of Cruz to fly out of the press pool, “To voters who have watched you run as an outsider all these months who now see you making this deal with John Kasich, how do you justify that as not collusion?”\nCruz responded:\nListen, I have been from day one an outsider and the easiest, the proof is in the pudding…the voters can ask who has stood up and led the fight against the Washington cartel from day one. And I am the only one in this race that has taken on, not just Democrats, but leaders in my own party over and over and over again. When I ran for Senate I promised the people of Texas I would lead the fight against Obamacare. That’s what I did in the Senate, much to the annoyance of the Washington cartel and as President I’ll repeal every word of Obamacare. When I ran for Senate in Texas I promised the voters, I would lead the fight against amnesty. That’s what I did in the Senate, leading the fight against the Gang of 8 amnesty bill at the same time that Donald Trump was funding the Gang of 8, giving over $50,000 to the proponents of amnesty, I was leading the fight and we defeated amnesty in Congress. As President I will stop amnesty, we’ll secure the borders, we’ll end sanctuary cities and we will end welfare benefits for those here illegally.\nCruz accused the Trump campaign of being scared of Indiana and saying he would much rather stay in northeastern states.\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"Donald Trump is two for two with teleprompter-ed speeches. That is, he is batting 1000 with remarks that are carefully prepared and delivered. So for his sake, he should keep it up. And if he does, he can win the Republican nomination in July and the general election in November—by carrying 40 states.\nTrump’s speech today to the Center for the National Interest (CFTNI), an old-line “realist” think tank in DC, was well received. CFTNI was once known as the Nixon Center, as in, the 37th president, and it still includes on its board such legendary Nixon foreign-policy hands as Henry Kissinger.\nNot surprisingly, Trump’s hard-nosed policy ideas were a tonic to grizzled Nixonian realpolitikers. Yet at the same time, his ideas were cheering to a younger generation, weary of the endless wars-for-democracy of the Bush 43 administration, as well as the foolishly sovereignty-smiting policies of the Clinton and Obama administrations.\nIndeed, in choosing to speak before CFTNI, as opposed to, say, AEI or Heritage, Trump was sending a clear signal to the neocons who dominated the Bush 43 administration: Your days of costly nation-building are done. (And yet interestingly, Trump was introduced by Zalmay Khalilzad, Bush 43’s ambassador to the United Nations.)\nSo when Trump puts his mind to it, he can be not only entertaining but also effective. His CFTNI speech, on top of his March 21 speech to the America Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), proves that Trump can operate smoothly at the presidential level.\nIn his 38-minute address, Trump got right down to it: “It’s time to shake the rust off America’s foreign policy. It’s time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold, something we have to do.”\nThat is, indeed, the sort of new broom that the voters have been looking for; it has animated not only the Trump campaign but also, we can observe, the Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) campaign.\nYes, we’ve had quite enough of “experts” who get their “genius” thoughts published in The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal, thereby shaping the failed foreign policies of the last three presidents.\nAs Trump said, under his leadership, “If America fights, it will only fight to win… victory with a capital ‘V.’” In the preceding sentence, we might note, first, the “if” and, second, the “V” for “Victory.” It’s thus easy to see Trump sewing up the military vote, which is generally Republican. So sorry, Huffington Post, your attempt to stir the politico-military pot is not going to succeed.\nYet at the same time, Trump made it clear that he was going to be not only careful but also judicious. He quoted the realist wisdom of John Quincy Adams from 1821: “We do not go abroad in search of enemies.”\nThus, in Trump’s words, we can see something that’s simultaneously both new and old: “The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else… That will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make.”\nYet Trump, being Trump, was never going to let a speech be nothing but airy abstractions; he dug right in on familiar specifics: “We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies.”\nThus in one sentence Trump staked out of his opposition to the borderless immigration policies of the last three presidents, going back to the early ’90s. None of them—not Clinton, not Bush 43, not Obama—have adequately defended the interests of the United States and its citizens. And some haven’t even tried.\nIndeed, Trump went further, sharply separating himself from the giddy utopianism that inspired Barack Obama to travel to Europe and try to prop up the faltering European Union:\nThe nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down… Under my administration, we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs.\nAnd then he singled out, as examples of what not to do, NAFTA and policies obsessed with “global warming.”\nDuring his administration, Trump said, “No American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of foreign countries.” Again, that’s how a rookie at politics goes right to the top job on his first try.\nCompleting his survey of the world, Trump reiterated his opposition to the Iran nuclear deal, and then paused to meditate over our “complicated relationships with Russia and China.” He added, “We are not bound to be adversaries; we should seek common ground.”\nAddressing Russia first, Trump declared his belief that “an easing of tensions and improved relations with Russia–from a position of strength—is possible.” Continuing, he laid out this game plan, straight from the Nixon-Kissinger-Reagan playbook: “Common sense says this cycle of hostility must end. Some say the Russians won’t be reasonable. I intend to find out. If we can’t make a good deal for America, then we will quickly walk from the table.”\nMoving to China, Trump declared, “A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China. We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways.”\nYet at the same time, he didn’t minimize the challenge with China: “We have allowed China to steal government secrets and engage in massive industrial espionage.” And then, of course, there’s the issue of trade—Trump didn’t back a bit from his hawkishness.\nNot every American will agree with his words, but most will. So Trump’s political challenge is to keep it up for the next seven months: Keep making the case for a center-right realism—while the Democrats poison themselves with crime-friendly political correctness and multiculturalism.\nTo be sure, Trump still has his quirks: He likes to say, for example, that a president should be “unpredictable.” Without a doubt, unpredictability is a virtue in a deal-making business executive, but it’s less of a virtue in a commander-in-chief.\nAlso, Trump likes to use the historically loaded phrase, “America First.” As he told the CFTNI, “America First will be the major and overriding theme of my administration, one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy and chaos with peace.”\nAmerica First, of course, was the name of the isolationist movement just prior to World War Two. Many of the America Firsters were perfectly sincere patriots, although not all were. And in any case, the good ones and the bad ones were all deeply discredited by Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 1941, followed by Nazi Germany’s declaration of war against the US four days later.\nThese quibbles over “unpredictable” and “America First” might seem like the mere parsing of words, and perhaps so—but that’s politics.\nMeanwhile, even as Trump was speaking, Hillary Clinton’s campaign was gearing up to respond, putting former secretary of state Madeleine Albright—holding, of course, a harshly opposing view—on the phone with reporters.\nAnd then, to make it a one-two punch, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) of South Carolina—every Democrat’s favorite Republican-bashing Republican—was busy tweeting out his latest anti-Trump tantrum for the “high church” neocons. Whereupon David Brock, the ex-conservative who has became Hillary’s best friend, was on the case, eagerly echoing Graham’s tweets, among others.\nSo Trump has his work cut out for him. The Clinton attack machine—bolstered, of course, by the likes of Lindsey Graham—is indeed formidable.\nYet Hillary must overcome the not-so-dry rot of the last eight years. Only once since World War Two has a party managed to win a third consecutive term in the White House, as Hillary is trying to do in 2016.\nAnd as for Trump, if he can stick to his center-right message—that is, saving America from the globalists of the right as well as of the left—and if he can offer a vision of broad prosperity, while not jumping into military quagmires, well, there’s a word for that: WINNING.\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — In a setback for Donald Trump, Indiana’s governor endorsed the front-runner’s chief rival, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), on Friday, just days before the state’s critical Republican primary contest.\nIndiana Gov. Mike Pence made his support for the Texas senator official during an afternoon radio interview, casting Cruz as “a principled conservative.”\n“The man has shown the courage of his convictions,” Pence said, citing Cruz’s fight against government spending and the federal health care law, and his “strong and unwavering stand for the sanctity of life.”\nPence, who faces his own re-election test this fall, also praised Trump, who he said “has given voice to the frustration of millions of working Americans.” ”I’m grateful for his voice in the national debate,” he said.\n“I’m not against anybody, but I will be voting for Ted Cruz in the upcoming Republican primary,” Pence added.\nThe Indiana governor’s backing gives Cruz a desperately needed boost in his fight to block Trump from claiming the delegate majority before the GOP’s national convention in July. A Trump win in Indiana on Tuesday would all but ensure he becomes the presumptive nominee.\nTrump swept all five Northeastern primary elections earlier in the week and enjoys a massive delegate advantage over his Republican rivals. Cruz has been mathematically eliminated from earning the 1,237 delegate majority, but insists he can block Trump from the majority as well, as the 2016 contest shifts to “friendlier terrain” in the West and Midwest. The Texas senator declared he is “all in” on Indiana.\nCruz said earlier Friday he would “enthusiastically welcome” Pence’s support.\n“The country is depending on Indiana to bring some sober common sense,” Cruz told reporters in Indianapolis, “instead of going down a rash course of action that is endangering this country.”\n“We’re barnstorming the state,” he added after the first of four scheduled Indiana appearances on Friday.\nPence, who is seeking his second term this fall, had been under enormous pressure from pro- and anti-Trump factions. Although he is more closely aligned with Cruz, he risks voter backlash in the fall if Tuesday’s primary contest shows Indiana is filled with Trump voters.\nTrump said this week that he had met the governor and asked for his backing.\n“I don’t think he’ll endorse anybody, actually – and he may endorse us,” Trump told CNN on Wednesday. “I don’t know. He’s a great guy. He’s become – you know, he’s done a very, very good job as governor and he’s a great guy. I don’t know if we’ll get his endorsement. I don’t know.”\nTrump added that he didn’t think Pence would endorse Cruz.\nYet Cruz and conservatives who support him have pressed Pence from the other direction.\n“Every day he sits on the sidelines is another day in which he could have made a difference,” Republican columnist Erick Erickson wrote Thursday on the website The Resurgent. “He has not used his influence in the conservative movement to rally against Trump.”\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"Sen. Ted Cruz told Indiana voters on Monday that the state’s election is “pivotal.”\nAt an afternoon rally in Fort Wayne Cruz emphasized, “we are neck and neck, this race is tied in Indiana” and that “it is 100 percent about turnout.”\n“At this point, the entire country is looking to the state of Indiana. Indiana has a national platform, has a national megaphone. And it is a choice, a very basic choice. Do we get behind a campaign that is based on yelling and screaming and cursing and insults and anger and hatred, or do we continue to unify behind a positive, optimistic, forward looking, conservative campaign?”\nHe hit on bringing “manufacturing jobs back to Indiana.”\nCruz referenced an interview with Chuck Todd that aired on Sunday to say that he was asked no less than nine times if he would back Trump if the real estate mogul were to become the nominee. Cruz responded instead by insisting he would win the nomination.\nHe urged voters to find 10, 15, 20 people to get to the polls.\n“We don’t want to look our kids in the eye and say we sat idly while the greatest country in the history of the world slipped from our grasp. As Reagan powerfully told us, freedom it’s not passed down in the bloodstream from one generation to the next. Every generation must stand and fight to preserve it or one day we will be forced to answer to our children and our children’s children, What was it like when America was free?”\nCruz estimated 2,000 people at the rally and urged each to bring at least 10 people to the polls, “that is enough to control the outcome of the primary here in Indiana.” Cruz further urged, “28 hours to find 10 more votes tomorrow.”\nAt one point Cruz suggested great danger in Donald Trump having power in the potential use of nuclear weapons, “You also want a leader with good judgement…you don’t want someone who is rash, who is hot-headed, who is liable to go off at the latest Twitter storm. In talking about somebody who would have his finger on the button, you want someone who is measured, who has judgement, who has common sense.”\nCruz was also a guest Monday on the Mike Gallagher Show during which he called the next 24 hours “absolutely pivotal” ahead of the Indiana primary election.\nGallagher and Cruz discussed extensive media coverage of a poll that puts GOP frontrunner Trump suddenly far ahead of Cruz in Indiana over a poll that puts Cruz suddenly far ahead of Trump.\n“This election, the next 24 hours, are absolutely pivotal,” said Cruz. “This election is pivotal.”\nIndiana Gov. Mike Pence recently stated that he would vote for Cruz. During the For Wayne rally Cruz said, “Mike and I have spent the day barnstorming the state of Indiana traveling across the state campaigning together.”\nCruz said of stated running mate Carly Fiorina that she most impressed him in the debates with how she “stands up to bullies.”\n“Every one of us has experienced in life going back to grade school that a bully isn’t strong, a bully is weak, a bully is scared, a bully needs affirmation for their own insecurities and so they find someone they think is weaker than they are and they pick on them because it makes them feel tough. And the only the only response that ever works with a bully is to pop ‘em in the nose.”\n“And Carly is someone who stands up to bullies whether they’re named Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton or Vladimir Putin.”\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"Donald Trump and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post, disagree on taxes, encryption, and, of course, who should be the next president. Rather strongly, in fact, on all three questions.\nThe Post slammed Donald Trump, yet again, on May 19. But this time, the headline was much more personal: “‘Not an appropriate way for a presidential candidate to behave’: Bezos fires back at Donald Trump.”\nIn the article, Post reporter Paul Farhi loyally quoted Bezos’ extensive criticism of Trump and then added, with a determined attitude of admiring docility toward his boss, “[Bezos] offered a vigorous defense of freedom of the press: ‘It’s critical that we be able to carefully examine our leaders.’”\nInterestingly, Bezos’ sharp words came after Trump attacked Bezos, Amazon, and the Post all at once, saying, among other things, that Bezos was using the Post to advance an obvious political agenda. Indeed, the obviousness of that political agenda became fully manifest on May 11, when the Post‘s Bob Woodward told the world that the paper had 20 staffers investigating Trump. Yes, that’s right, 20 diggers. That many on Hillary? Woodward didn’t say. And of course, in the meantime, every day, the Post runs easily a half-dozen articles, editorials, and op-eds either praising Hillary Clinton or blasting Trump.\nSo what’s going on? Part of the explanation, of course, is that the Post is a liberal newspaper, which always—long before Bezos bought it in 2013—endorses the Democratic presidential candidate and the liberal-left line.\nYet there could be still more going on. Specifically, the Bezos/Post agenda seems to also include direct financial benefit to Bezos—net worth, already, according to Forbes, more than $60 billion. As Trump said earlier this month, Bezos is “getting away with murder, tax-wise. He’s using The Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don’t tax Amazon like they should be taxed.” Trump has also indicated that he thinks Amazon is a flagrant antitrust violator that’s a view widely shared by, for example, book authors.\nFor its part, the Post’s Paul Farhi, dutiful employee that he is, contented himself with simply quoting Bezos on the tax and antitrust question: “I’m very, very comfortable with all of Amazon’s approaches and behaviors, [such as] the way we pay taxes.”\nSo does Bezos’ smug assertion settle the matter? Maybe not. The Post didn’t note, for example, that the record strongly suggests that Amazon pays just a tiny fraction of the statutory corporate tax rate of 35 percent. But according to The New York Times, Amazon pays just six percent (these data are from 2007 to 2012; it seems unlikely that Amazon’s tax rate has gone up since).\nInterestingly, candidate Trump has called for a dramatic cut in the US corporate tax rate, which is the highest in the world, down to a more competitive 15 percent. Yet even at 15 percent, if collected, that would spell be a huge tax increase for Amazon, as well as other globalized tech companies, such as Google and Facebook.\nSo maybe that’s why Bezos is happy with the Post’s constant crusade against Trump. Maybe he wants Hillary Clinton to win. Sure, sure, Clinton has said that she wants to raise taxes on “fatcats,” but is it really likely that if she wins the White House she will sock it to the very people who helped her get there?\nYet if liberal ideology and taxes are two issues that separate Bezos and his paper from Trump, we can add a third, which is perhaps the most important of all: homeland security. Yes, Bezos and Amazon have sided with Apple on the key issue of encryption, which is to say, the issue of national, as well as homeland, security.\nAnd another Post story loudly tells that tale:\nAmazon chief executive Jeffrey Bezos said Wednesday his company is wholly aligned with Apple in its fight against government investigators who asked Apple to break its own encryption programs so they could gain access the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorists.\nSo here again, Trump and Bezos are on the opposite sides. Trump has not addressed Amazon’s position on encryption, but he has loudly criticized Apple’s stated policy of non-cooperation. As he said on February 17, “Who do they think they are?” adding, “We should use common sense… we should open it up.”\nOf course, Apple did not relent, and the Obama administration, perhaps mindful of a big donor, did not press the issue with Apple. And so, on February 19, Trump, who had previously used Apple products, announced that he would henceforth be boycotting Apple. And, in fact, Trump now uses a Samsung. And one might guess that Trump will boycott Amazon, too, since it is now avowedly on the same team as Apple.\nSo as we can see, this November, the American people will have a choice: Trump or Bezos. In additional to all his other campaign goals, Trump stands for making big companies pay their fair share, for enforcing anti-trust laws, and for keeping America safe—and oh yes, for winning the presidency so he can make America great again.\nAnd by his actions, and those of his minions, Bezos is seemingly against all of those goals.\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"Fourth in a series.\nIn the first part of this series, we observed that greatness is tangible; you know it when you see it. In the second part, we saw that military greatness was really intangible, insofar as we whipped the other guy—even Hitler’s mighty Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe. In the third part, we saw that greatness also meant doing big things on the home front, such as making the desert bloom, thereby providing jobs, wealth, and hope.\nNow, in this fourth part, let’s talk about another kind of greatness, peace with honor. As we shall see, peace with honor often comes from crafty diplomacy. Or, as Donald Trump might put it, peace through deal-making.\n- How Deal-Making Brought Peace with Honor\nNo doubt at least some pointers about grand-strategy deal-making were covered in Trump’s May 18 meeting with Henry Kissinger, the 92-year-old former national security adviser, secretary of state, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. After all, Kissinger still stands as the beau ideal of a US diplomat.\nTo illustrate, let’s look back at an era of US history, in which, in the latter stages, Kissinger was a key player.\nBeginning in the 1960s, first under President John Kennedy, then under President Lyndon Johnson, the US became increasingly engaged in the fighting in Vietnam. The American effort to thwart communism might have been, as Ronald Reagan later said in 1980, a “noble cause,” but at the time, it was a deeply unpopular cause. By the November 1968 US presidential elections, after the death of more than 35,000 Americans in the fighting, the American people had turned against the war. And so a new man, Richard Nixon, was elected that year. His pledge was peace, but also, he declared, it would be “peace with honor.”\nTaking office in early 1969, Nixon and his top diplomat, Kissinger, had the challenge of sorting through their options. In the short run, the options weren’t good—we were losing up to 500 KIAs a week in the jungle fighting.\nOne major factor was immediately evident to Nixon and Kissinger: There could be no victory, or even honorable peace, in South Vietnam, so long as the enemy invaders in the South could be resupplied from the North, and so long as the North could be resupplied by two fellow communist states, the People’s Republic China and the Soviet Union.\nThat is, so long as the Hanoi government had the physical, diplomatic, and moral support of those two superpowers—China, an adjoining country, and the USSR, just beyond China—it could not lose, and so it would not stop fighting.\nIndeed, it was the presence of many Russian and Chinese technicians in certain areas, such as the capital city of Hanoi and the major port of Haiphong, that made those targets off-limits to US airstrikes: We didn’t want to kill a lot of Russians or Chinese.\nIn addition, of course, the idea of going to the root of the problem—that is, a ground invasion of North Vietnam—was never seriously considered. The argument to US war planners was simple: We don’t want to kill Chinese or Russians, because we don’t want to let the fighting escalate into World War Three.\nOnly later did we receive confirmation of what many had suspected, that Chinese and Russian personnel were more than technicians, but were, in fact, serving as combatants in the fighting—that is, actively killing Americans. Yet even if we had known that at the time, it’s unlikely that the limits on US power would have changed; Vietnam was intended as a limited war with limited objectives. Yes, unfortunately, the war became really expensive, in terms of blood and treasure, but that’s often the case in war—one or more of the warring parties miscalculates.\nMeanwhile, in South Vietnam, the US could, and did, win every fight on the battlefield, but that didn’t matter—the North Vietnamese were not going to stop fighting. 10:1 kill ratio? 100:1 kill ratio? The North Vietnamese weren’t deterred, because they wanted to win—and they were willing to pay that price, whatever it was.\nAnd so even though a “peace process” had begun in Paris in May 1968, the North Vietnamese weren’t sincerely interested in any negotiation, for one simple reason: Despite their heavy casualties, they thought they were winning.\nSo Nixon and Kissinger developed a new strategy to achieve “peace with honor.” They maintained a US military presence in South Vietnam, even as they slowly de-escalated the number of American combat troops.\nYet at the same time, they resolved to do something new—something that had never occurred to their predecessors. They sought to go over the head of North Vietnam and strike a deal with Hanoi’s patrons in Beijing and Moscow. Any dealing with China was, of course, deeply controversial, because the US had cut off diplomatic relations with China in 1949 after Mao Zedong’s communists took over. And Nixon, of course, was famous as an anti-communist. Yet he was also a foreign-policy realist, as well as a smart deal-maker. And so after Kissinger paved the way, Nixon visited Beijing in February 1972; then, in May 1972, the 37th president visited Moscow.\nDuring those trips, which lasted seven and eight days, respectively, Nixon reached an understanding with North Vietnam’s bosses. The full details have never been revealed, but the subsequent record is crystal clear.\nAnd we know this, too, as context: At the time, in the early 70s, China and the Soviet Union were veering apart. Sharing a 2700-mile border, heaving with unresolved boundary disputes, the two communist countries, in 1969, had even collided in a brief armed conflict. In other words, in diplomatic terms, Nixon had plenty of leverage on both states. That is, he could bargain to make the US the superior “two out of three”—that is, siding with one against the other—in the three-way game of high-stakes geopolitics.\nIn retrospect, it might seem that this Nixon-Kissinger diplomatic initiative was rather obvious, but, in fact, as we have seen, it had eluded both the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.\nLater that year, 1972, after the peace negotiations had stalled yet again, the US resolved to nudge the North Vietnamese back to the bargaining table. America launched Operation Linebacker II, the so-called “Christmas Bombing,” from December 18 to December 29, 1972. It was the largest aerial bombardment since World War Two, and crucially, it included many previously off-limits targets in Hanoi and Haiphong. So finally, after more than a decade of fighting, the North Vietnamese felt such military pressure that they had to reach a deal. Yes, they had, in effect, been bombed into submission, and it must have been galling to the North Vietnamese that their “friends” in China and the USSR were standing by and watching, doing nothing.\nThus did North Vietnamese come back to the peace talks, hungry for a deal. The Paris Peace Accords were signed on January 27, 1973. It was far from a perfect deal, but it might have lasted—if Nixon had lasted.\nYet as we all know, the Nixon-Kissinger settlement was soon undone—although for reasons that had nothing to do with Vietnam. Nixon was driven from office by the Watergate scandal in August 1974, and the Democrats went on to win a huge victory in the November 1974 midterm elections. Whereupon the Democrats, enjoying nearly 2:1 margins in both houses of Congress—and determined to root out anything that had Nixon’s fingerprints—sought, out of sheer spite, to undo the peace deal and cut off any more US aid to South Vietnam. And so they did. Saigon fell on April 30, 1975.\nThus the Vietnam War had a particularly painful end. After all that military sacrifice, the American effort was undone, mostly by politicians in Washington, D.C.\nYet looking back at those years, we can see the positive power of deal-making: That is, the Nixon-Kissinger deal worked for a while, and it could have worked for a long time.\nTo sum up: “The art of the deal,” to borrow a phrase, was, in this instance, to go over the head of the enemy and make a deal with his sponsors. That’s an honorable way to end a war. Smart!\nOkay, so that’s a history lesson, and already, we can start to see how its lessons might apply to America’s continuing conflict with jihadi terror. So let’s take a closer look at how one actually wins a war against insurgents.\n- Cutting the Enemy Off from Supply: The Key to Victory\nAs we have seen, the US could not win the Vietnam War so long as our foe, North Vietnam, could be reliably resupplied by China and the Soviet Union. In geopolitical terms, the North Vietnamese had the advantage of what’s called “strategic depth.”\nMoreover, as we think about all the counter-insurgencies and brushfire wars that the US has fought since World War Two, we can see that the failures and frustrations came when we could not cut off the enemy from his supply lines.\nThis was the case in the Korean War, from 1950 to 1953: The North Koreans could be steadily resupplied, once again, by China and Russia. And so, even after more than 33,000 American combat deaths, the fighting ended in essentially a tie; to this day, communist North Korea counts itself as an arch enemy of the US.\nBy contrast, twice in the 90s, we confronted an enemy whom we were able to isolate and, therefore, decisively defeat. The first was Saddam Hussein, and the second was Slobodan Milosevic. In each case, Iraq and Serbia, we used diplomacy to surround the country with enemies—or at least non-helpful neutrals—and so it was easy to win, and win quickly. In the 1991 Gulf War, we might recall, George H.W. Bush persuaded all the other Arab countries—including neighbors Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia—to join in a grand coalition against Iraq. So the Iraqis had no chance: They folded within weeks. And so, too, a few years later, surrounded as they were, the Serbs surrendered without a single American KIA.\nUnfortunately, that basic lesson—Surround Them To Defeat Them—was lost on president George W. Bush. As we all remember, 43 went into both Afghanistan, in 2001, and Iraq, in 2003, without securing the surrounding countries as allies, or at least as non-participants. That’s why the rebels in both countries could be so effective; as in Vietnam, they were steadily resupplied by countries that were outright enemies (such as Syria and Iran) or “frenemies” that were happy enough to see us bleed (such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan).\nAs a result, as earlier in Vietnam, the bravery of US troops on the ground, and the effectiveness of US airpower, was mostly for naught. The enemy, drawing its forces from the general population, plus outside Islamist freelancers, could keep being replenished and, as a result, keep coming.\nIn addition, Russia and China were involved—once again, against us. So far as we know, Russia and China did not directly help either Al Qaeda in Iraq or the Taliban in Afghanistan, but it’s undeniable that those two superpowers provided diplomatic “cover” to the lesser countries that were helping the insurgents—mostly, Iran and Pakistan.\nWhat was missing from these recent wars, we can readily see, was a shrewd Nixon-Kissinger-like diplomatic strategy—the strategy of isolating the enemy. As a result, absent such a larger smart vision, US forces could still be fighting the terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan a full century from now.\nYes, it is a bit strange that none of the presidents and diplomats of the last 15 years have seen the situation as clearly as Nixon and Kissinger did nearly half-a-century ago: Namely, the road to victory in Kabul and Baghdad runs through Moscow and Beijing. Or, as Trump has said in his own inimitable way, “We are led by very, very, stupid people.”\nAnd because our leaders are—how do we put this diplomatically?—not as up to par as they could be, we have not only floundered in Afghanistan and Iraq, but are also up against a potentially calamitous crisis of overcommitment around the world. So let’s take a look at that overcommitment, because then we can see the beginning of a new and better plan.\n- The Quintuple Containment—Not Sustainable!\nToday, it is currently US policy to undertake the following missions of corralling our foes; the diplomatic term of art is “containment” In fact, we have undertaken to contain five different forces; we can call this the Quintuple Containment–more precisely, the attempted Quintuple Containment. Let’s take a look at each in turn:\nFirst, we seek to contain China, even if that means risking an armed confrontation in the South China Sea—or worse. We can note the red-letter headline atop The Drudge Report on May 19: “CHINA WARNS USA: MILITARY READY ‘IF PROVOKED.’” America should never back down from a necessary fight over vital interests, but we might step back and ask ourselves: Do really want to risk World War Three over the Spratly Islands? Yet today, that’s exactly what we’re doing.\nAnd yes, it’s all the more strange that even as we rattle our saber at China, we are, at the same time, running a $365 billion trade deficit with China. So we’re running the risk of going to war with a country from which we import large quantities of goods, including vital war materiel; the Pentagon, for example, uses Apple iPhones and iPads, made in China.\nSecond, we seek to contain Russia, even if that means risking an armed confrontation with the Russian military. In a series of aggressive actions, the Russians have been buzzing our Navy ships repeatedly, which is a reminder that we could find ourselves embroiled in a conflict with them, too.\nThird, we seek to contain Iran. Okay, maybe we’re not doing such a good job of crimping. As we have seen, they don’t hesitate to grab our Navy ships and humiliate our sailors, even as they continue to sponsor terror and probably, the recent treaty notwithstanding, continue to develop their nuclear arsenal. Yes, it would seem that Secretary of State John Kerry’s treasured nuclear deal with Iran is worse than worthless.\nFourth, we seek to contain terrorism, be it Al Qaeda, ISIS, etc. On that front, terrorism might seem to be contained—unless we count the recent terrorist attacks in California, Paris, Brussels, and, quite possibly, the May 19 crash of the EgyptAir passenger jet. We can observe, incidentally, that it would be easier to contain terrorism if we weren’t actively liberating terrorists, as we did in 2011, when we overthrew Qaddafi in Libya.\nFifth, we seek to contain carbon dioxide—that is, fight “climate change.” Yes, it’s the long twilight struggle against the CO2 molecule that seems most to engage the Obama administration. Indeed, amidst all the dangers of the world, Secretary of State John Kerry said in 2014 that “climate change” is “the greatest challenge of our generation.”\nIndeed, as Breitbart’s Jerome Hudson pointed out in 2015, the Obama administration has made that absurd claim no less than 22 times. And so if fighting “climate change” means shutting down the US economy, well, that seems to the Greens who have taken over the Democratic Party to be a small price to pay.\nWe can quickly see that the US, strong as it is, can’t succeed at all five of these attempted containments—plus, of course, the other hundred or so major goals that the State Department has set for itself, from human rights to refugee resettlement to cultural exchange to foreign aid. We can further see the obvious point: Seeking to do everything is really a plan for accomplishing nothing.\nOf course, while most Republicans would quickly dispense with goal #5, climate change, that still leaves four containment goals—China, Russia, Iran, and terrorism—which might be one or two too many.\nAfter all, America is powerful, but not that powerful. With four percent of the world’s population and about 21 percent of the world’s GDP, we find ourselves in a situation in which America’s credibility, including our nuclear deterrent, is on the line in a half-dozen flashpoints, from Europe to the Middle East to Asia—and this at a time when President Obama has been cutting the defense budget.\nYet even if we increase our defense budget, as Trump has said we must, it’s still plain to see that we don’t have the resources to be the world’s policeman. So we need a different approach, one that enables us to decide what our most urgent priorities are—and to focus on them.\nYes, the essence of a genuine strategy—as opposed to simply random, promiscuous overcommitment—is to decide what’s genuinely important and to focus on that. As Trump wrote in his 2011 book, The Midas Touch, “Focus is essential to success, and successful people are people who can focus.” True words.\nSo let’s get specific: What, precisely, might we be doing differently? And what, exactly, should we be focusing on?\nWe might start by thinking about who our real enemies are—that is, entities and countries that have sworn to kill us. And by that reckoning, the list of four serious “containees” shrinks down to just two: Iran and the terrorists. That is, if the official policy of Iran is “Death to America,” well, that’s a pretty clear signal—the Iranians are not our friends. That could change, of course, but it hasn’t yet: The Iranians have been consistent in their hostility since 1979.\nMeanwhile, as for ISIS, Al Qaeda, Al Shabab, Boko Haram, etc., well, they, too, are clear enough: They hate us, and they want us dead.\nSo that should clarify US thinking: If someone wants to fight us, well, one way or another, we have to fight them.\nBy contrast, China and Russia are in a different category. They are hardly friend, but they have never expressed killer-hostility. They are strategic rivals, to be sure, but they are not, at least as of yet, mortal threats. And let’s hope that they never become mortal threats, because they both possess massive nuclear arsenals.\nYet in the meantime, as we shall see, there’s much common ground between the three countries that could be productively furrowed for the benefit of each.\nRussia’s Vladimir Putin, for example, says all the time that he wants to cooperate with the US, starting with counter-terrorism. In January, for example, Putin said:\nWe are faced with common threats, and we still want all countries… to join their efforts to combat these threats, and we are still striving for this.\nNow, of course, some will say that Putin is not sincere. Yet it’s been well documented that the Russians were perfectly sincere when they warned us about the Tsarnaev brothers, the Boston Marathon bombers—but we chose not to listen.\nThe Russians, in fact, have a serious security threat from restive Muslim populations, both within their borders and nearby—and they know it. So maybe we can help each other—just as in World War Two, when the US and USSR teamed up to beat Hitler. A lot of American GIs survived the “Good War,” of course, because we had Russian help.\nTrump gets this potential for a US-Russian deal. As he said in his foreign policy speech to the Center for the National Interest in April, “Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism,” and so there’s the opportunity, he suggested, for an understanding that would both cool tensions and kill terrorists. As Trump also said, “Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility, must end and ideally will end soon.” If it did, he added, it would be “good for both countries.” And that, of course, is how deals are made—through mutual advantage.\nOf course, Trump still has his guard up:\nSome say the Russians won’t be reasonable. I intend to find out. If we can’t make a deal under my administration, a deal that’s great — not good, great — for America, but also good for Russia, then we will quickly walk from the table. It’s as simple as that. We’re going to find out.\nAs the wise Ronald Reagan said of the Soviets in the 80s, “Trust, but verify.”\nAnd the same holds true for China. The PRC also has a Muslim problem. It is home to more than 50 million Muslims, most of them ethnic Uighurs, who are a Turkic people, highly attuned to the jihadi currents rippling through the Middle East. And so China, too, has been the victim of repeated Muslim terrorist attacks. Moreover, as with the Russians, the Chinese have said, explicitly, that they would like to work with the US. Here’s a March 15 headline in China Daily: “China seeks US cooperation to counter terror.”\nOnce again, to make a statement is not the same as making it true, but the obvious reality, that terrorism is a major threat to all the major powers, is enough to inspire some confidence that a deal is possible.\nAs Trump also said in his speech last month:\nWe desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China. We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries. We should seek common ground based on shared interests.\n- A Vision for Victory\nSo thus we see the outlines of a deal that would let the US concentrate on its urgent enemies: The next US president would reach an accord with Russia and China on counter-terrorism. Such an accord would open up the prospect that the US could actually succeed in containing Iran and ISIS, and also, in addition, open up the prospect of paving the way to additional “confidence-building measures” between the major nuclear powers. The point here is not necessarily that the US, Russia, and China are ever going to be best friends; instead, the goal here is to deal with the greater crises first, and the lesser crises, later. As Trump says, focus means just that: you focus on what you really have to get done. That’s strong management, and it’s also strong leadership.\nAs we have seen, in 1972, President Richard Nixon was a strong leader. Ignoring the advice of the lesser minds that preceded him, he went over the head of the North Vietnamese enemy to reach a deal with China and Russia, thus ending the Vietnam War.\nAnd so, beginning in 2017, a President Trump might have the opportunity to meet with, once again, to China and Russia, this time to cut off the supply, aid, and comfort to the terrorist state of Iran, as well as to all the major terrorists of the world.\nThat’s peace, and peace with honor. That’s greatness.\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-MT), a former Navy Commander at SEAL Team Six before his election to the U.S. House, told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that he is throwing his full weight behind presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump for president.\nZinke wants to help Trump beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whom he infamously once called “the antichrist,” in November in any way he possibly can.\nZinke wants to help Trump beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whom he infamously once called “the antichrist,” in November in any way he possibly can.\n“The Democrats are besides themselves because they don’t understand Trump,” Zinke said. “They don’t understand, you don’t get between the American people—because Americans are upset. Absolutely.”\nZinke said he’s also open to being vice president or in any cabinet position if Trump asks him to serve, as well as from his current congressional seat.\n“I know my name has been thrown around, and I would be honored to the duty in whatever capacity that is,” Zinke said when asked about how he has been named by some as a potential vice presidential pick for Trump. “I’m honored to be a Congressman. I would be honored to be a part of the cabinet. I would be honored to be the vice president. I would be honored to do my duty. You know why? It’s about making America great again.”\nZinke is scheduled to appear with Trump in Montana later this week to formally endorse him. He appeared on Fox News Wednesday morning to endorse the GOP’s presumptive nominee and conducted this interview the previous evening.\nHe looks forward to helping Trump in any way he possibly can ahead of November.\n“I want to be a part of the team that’s making America great again in whatever capacity I can serve,” Zinke said.\nZinke’s role as a Congressman with solid relationships across Capitol Hill, and someone with a military leadership background, could get him on the short list as a potential vice presidential candidate—or as a cabinet pick down the road. His pugnacious style—he eloquently lambasted Clinton throughout the course of this interview, systematically tying together her old scandals from the 1990s and earlier with the ones she’s facing today—could land him a key spot on the Trump team.\nWhen asked about the clarity in choice heading into the general election, Zinke said that, for national security leaders like him, it could not be more clear. Zinke said:\nThere’s a few points: One is we need a commander in chief who supports our troops rather than abandoning them in Benghazi. I still remember in Benghazi because I lost friends there. Secondly, I think we need a commander in chief that honors the sacrifices of those in combat rather than lying about being there—and thirdly, we need a commander in chief that will hunt down terrorists rather than releasing them from GITMO. And lastly, we need a commander in chief that understands peace is only gained through strength rather than a policy of retreat and defeat. I watched as we all watched when Hillary Clinton disdained the uniforms of the Marines, she has lied on the tarmac in Bosnia when she said ‘I ran through sniper fire.’ I was there.\nZinke was actually there in Bosnia on the other side of the airstrip at that famous Hillary Clinton landing when she claimed she was taking sniper fire—while she clearly was not.\n“Yeah I was there. I was in a lawn chair on the other side of the runway,” Zinke said.\nHe said he finds that type of a lie disrespectful to the servicemen and women in uniform for the United States around the country and around the globe. He also finds it remarkably similar to lies Clinton has told about many other things, like the Benghazi terrorist attacks and the Whitewater scandal. Zinke went on to say:\nIt’s the same type of lies when she said the video was responsible for Benghazi. It’s the same type of lie when she had the cattle futures. It’s the same type of lie on Whitewater. It’s the same type of lie on Travelgate. It’s the same type of lie on Clinton Foundation. And the list goes on and on and on. As a president, we need a businessman who understands that business is not usual—someone who’s not going to put up with business as usual in Washington, D.C. Having a businessman who’s not going to put up with business as usual in Washington, D.C., is exactly what we need. I’m a first term Congressman—and man, you know, status quo is not working. America is smarter than the politicians. America is demanding a change and not more of the same cronyism, not more of the same deception, corruption and business. Washington, D.C., needs to be shaken up.\nZinke also took a swipe at one of Clinton’s key foreign policy advisers, Wendy Sherman, who was integral to President Barack Obama’s Iranian nuclear deal during her time at the U.S. State Department.\n“Look at it from a Commander in Chief side: Look at who one of her leading policy advisers is on national security. Wendy Sherman,” Zinke said. “This is the same person that navigated the Iranian deal. Look at when she was Secretary of State and, oh by the way, running the Clinton Foundation and soliciting funds for the Clinton Foundation while she’s the Secretary of State. How is that even possible?”\nWhen it comes to the Clinton Cash scandal, Zinke said that the Clintons’ behavior is so bad that even the Obama team—specifically, Valerie Jarrett—crafted a document that she had to sign distancing her official State Department actions from the Clinton Foundation.\n“She summarily ignored it,” Zinke said of that document.\n“These side deals she’s done with the Clinton Foundation I think are damning,” Zinke added. “The whole thing is unbelievable.”\nBehavior like that, he said, gives off the impression she believes she is above the law. She would, if her last name was not Clinton, be serving a prison sentence in Leavenworth right now, Zinke said, adding:\nJust like if you and I did the emails, if you and I did that, we would be in Leavenworth, Kansas. There is no question in my mind. As a Naval Commander, there is people that violated, all the rules of classified information—they’re in Leavenworth, probably now—and she walks with SAP, with Special Access Programs, Top Secret by definition that would do grievous harm to us and our allies and she once again covers up because she thinks she’s above the law. But once again in this country no one is above the law, but she has set a long pattern of that and as a Commander in Chief she was a disaster as a Secretary of State. As a president, we would risk the fall of our Republican because I think the corruption and the cronyism runs that deep.\nZinke also said that Hillary Clinton has a “disdain” for men and women in uniform—whether it be the troops of America’s armed forces or police officers or anyone else protecting American communities. When it comes to Trump, though, he sees someone who “respects” those who serve to protect America. He continued:\nWhen Hillary Clinton was in the White House, she had a disdain for the Marines in uniform. She didn’t like looking at a Marine in a uniform. It has continued. So I think we need to return to respect for service members, respect for our law enforcement, respect for our firemen, respect for civil order and those who protect communities. What I see with Donald Trump, I see that—I see a man that respects those who serve and I see also a man that understands the fundamentals of business in that you grow the economy by growing the private sector and not the public sector.\nOn the coal front—noting that his state of Montana has the “most coal reserves of any state in the country”—Zinke added that Clinton is going to come crush the American economy by shutting down coal mining, while Trump is going to rejuvenate America by opening up the industry. He said:\nYou know what you do is when she makes that statement, that she wants to put coal out of business? She’s going to put America out of business because unless you have energy that’s cost effective, abundant, then you can’t manufacture—and if you can’t be competitive in manufacturing, you won’t have any jobs. It’s that simple. So when Hillary says ‘I’m going to kill coal,’ what she’s really saying is ‘I’m going to kill American industry and going to kill jobs.’ And in Montana, I want a president that creates jobs and not kills them.”\nWhen it comes to refugees, Zinke said he agrees “wholeheartedly” with Trump that the whole program—and how Clinton wants to go even further than Obama— is a terrifying prospect for the country.\nIn a recent interview with Breitbart News in his Midtown, Manhattan, office in New York City’s Trump Tower, Trump said that Clinton “wants to allow the Syrians to come in in numbers far greater than even Obama.”\n“We have no idea who these people are,” Trump said. “They’re not documented. Nobody knows anything about them. I think it’s catastrophic for the country if that’s allowed to happen.”\nZinke responded to that quote, saying:\nI agree wholeheartedly—in fact, it was my bill that passed the House bipartisan with a veto-proof majority that ended the refugee program until the three agencies of jurisdiction could give us some assurance that they weren’t here to do us harm. That to me is just simply common sense and putting America’s interests first.\nUltimately, Zinke added, Clinton is such a “bad candidate” that she has had to “cheat” to get to the point where she will eventually beat Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a proud socialist, for the nomination.\n“It’s unbelievable that—number one, she had to cheat to beat Bernie,” Zinke said. “She cheated in Iowa. According to the Democrats, she cheated in Nevada. This should not come as a surprise given how weak of a candidate she is—even Democrats don’t like her.”\nThat, Zinke argued, means Trump is in great shape heading into the general election.\n“Mr. Trump has a wind at his back and fair seas ahead,” Zinke said.\nHe also said he could see lots of Sanders supporters backing Trump in November because of the way they have been treated by a rigged system in their party.\n“I think a lot of Bernie supporters will vote for Trump because they will rather have honesty than corruption,” Zinke said. “The Bernie Sanders folks are just as upset at what’s going on in our country as the Trump people, quite frankly. They’re expressing it differently, but I think a lot of Bernie Sanders people when they look at it objectively are going to vote for Trump.”\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"Fifth in a series\nMost of us recognize that America is being pulled apart, becoming more unequal. We can add that this is not just the old split between workers and non-workers; instead, increasingly, it’s a split among workers.\nYes, there’s a new elite, namely, those workers and owners connected to government-favored industries, such as tech and finance—and to the government itself. And then there’s everyone else, workers and owners involved in unfavored industries. If that seems like a lopsided numerical ratio, between favored and unfavored—well, welcome to the crony-ized America of 2016, where there’s only room for a few insiders.\nAnd yet at the same time, precisely because the skew is so large, one can see that this inequality will cause—already has caused—a substantial political backlash. As we can note today, the rising anger over this yawning gap has fueled the presidential campaigns of both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. Indeed, it takes the full righteous anger of just about everyone, in both parties, to bulk up the fury that we see in the pollsters’ “right direction/wrong track” numbers, which show an overwhelming, more than 2:1 negative outcome, 26:65.\nAnd so, too, this November, the political implications are likely to be staggering—that is, really bad news for incumbents. And perceptually, at least, it’s hard to think of anyone who is more of an incumbent than Hillary Clinton, she who has been in and around the top echelons of the federal government for a quarter-century. And it’s also hard to think of anyone who has benefited more from the “rigged” system than Bill and Hillary.\nMeanwhile, a new study from the Economic Innovation Group (EIG) reveals further numbers that are even more grotesquely startling. The EIG study, derived from Census Bureau data, did indeed uncover some astounding numbers. In the report, EIG got right to it, showing how economic growth through entrepreneurship was increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few: “The first and most unambiguously troubling [finding] is a collapse in the number of new firms in the economy”—that is, new-business startups, the essence of entrepreneurial energy. And the second, almost as troubling finding, the report added, is “the increasing geographic concentration of recovery-era businesses and jobs into a smaller number of more populous counties.”\nThe EIG report broke down data from three different economic recoveries, in three different decades: the 90s, the 00s, and the 10s. Figure 1 shows the drastic falloff in new business formations, by nearly two-thirds: from more than 420,000 in the 1992-1996 recovery, dipping down to 400,000 in the 2002-2006 recovery—and then a sharp crash, plummeting to 166,000 in the 2010-2014 recovery. Indeed, the total number of firms in the US economy today lags below the levels of 2004.\nIn addition, even these meager gains have been increasingly concentrated in only a few places, and the losses have been distributed far more widely. In the 90s, just 17 percent of counties suffered a net decrease in the number of businesses; by contrast, in the 10s, a full 59 percent of counties suffered a net loss. (If you’re curious as to how your county fared, take a look at Figure 5.)\nEqually startling is the concentration of economic activity in a handful of lucky-duck counties—just 20 of them, to be exact. According to the report, those 20 counties, accounting for about one-sixth of the total US population, garnered half of all the economic growth in the country. Figure 8 provides a list of those elite counties.\nHere we can note something interesting, if not surprising: the accelerating trend toward economic stratification. In the 1990s, it took 125 counties to add up to a total of half of all the economic growth in the country; in the 2000s, it took fewer, just 64; and today, as we have seen, it takes just 20 counties. That’s 20 counties, we might note, out of some 3131 counties, parishes, and independent towns across the breadth of America.\nSo undeniably, the benefits of growth are intensifying in a smaller and smaller number of areas—and dissipating everywhere else.\nYet why is this happening? The EIG report doesn’t attempt to answer that question definitively, but it makes a passing reference to the booming areas being more globally networked into the world, more “knowledge-based,” and thus more likely to attract immigrants. We might note that EIG, although headquartered in Washington, DC, is Silicon Valley-funded, so it shouldn’t be a surprise that its report includes a pitch for the Valley-favored policies of more immigration and more globalization.\nIn other words, the report sums up the Silicon Valley conventional wisdom: Globalism is not only good, but also inevitable. And thus the implicit message to the rest of the country: Don’t fight the power. Submit. Get with the program.\nPerhaps Heartland America, seeing that it is being economically bypassed, will decide to give up. That is, folks in the Heartland might conclude that they would rather switch than fight. That is, maybe Nevada, and Arkansas, and South Carolina, and Michigan—to name four “loser” states—might choose to capitulate, and decide that they need to globalize, no matter what. Would that work, economically, for these places? It seems doubtful, but maybe they’ll try anyway, and start the process by throwing themselves open to mass immigration.\nYet there’s another way of thinking about the economic trends described in the EIG report. Perhaps, instead of simply passively going along with the trends EIG describes, the rest of the country could choose to fight, not switch. Maybe folks on Main Street could demand their fair share.\nOf course, some will immediately insist that there’s nothing that can be done, that everyone in the country must bow down to the secular sacredness of the “free market.”\nBut what if the “free market” isn’t free? What if the economic conditions we have in America today were not the result of some “invisible hand,” but, rather, the result of the visible hand of political wheeling and dealing?\nIn fact, as we consider the policies that led to this sudden economic concentration, we can see that they were utterly deliberate, enacted with full awareness as to their impact. Yes, it was a conscious deliberation—the deliberate picking of winners and losers—that got us to this point.\nHow so? Let’s look at three policy clusters:\nFirst, globalism, the obvious fruit of NAFTA, the WTO, and a dozen other trade deals—deals which, of course, have aided the big port cities, such as Miami and Los Angeles (both of which are in EIG’s Top 20). Meanwhile, as for Indiana and Ohio—well, we know what happened to those states, and all their counties.\nSecond, financialism, made possible by the rampant deregulation of the financial sector in recent decades, culminating in the repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999, and subsequently bolstered by the multi-trillion-dollar policy of “quantitative easing” over the last decade. So obviously New York City made it into the Top 20, and now the rest of the country is owned, seemingly, by some hedge-funder “managing” his assets with a spreadsheet and an algorithm. Meanwhile, of course, the disappearance of locally-owned banks means the disappearance of locally-available capital for jobs and growth.\nThird, the phenomenal growth of the Internet and e-commerce, which was facilitated, of course, by many federal policies, including the FCC-mandated transfer of value from the phone companies to the Internet companies, and then to the decision to tax-shelter online purchases from sales taxes. So it’s no wonder that California’s Santa Clara and San Francisco counties are also listed in the Top 20.\nSo yes, life has been good for investment bankers, asset managers, and app-makers, even as it’s been hard for just about everyone else.\nYet there’s a flaw in this happy-yuppie-techie world.\nAnd that flaw is just this: The resulting politics are not stable, because so few are winning and so many are losing. And in politics, the majority rules.\nWe might consider: Those 20 winning counties are in just seven states—Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Nevada, New York, and Texas. Those are mostly big states, to be sure; in electoral-college terms, they add up to 189 electoral votes. That’s a lot, but as we know, America has 50 states. And those other 43 states possess a total of 349 electoral votes. So, to put it bluntly, the losers outnumber the winners. Thus we can see the makings of a Trump-ian, or Sanders-ian, majority coalition of the frozen-out, demanding justice.\nAt this point, we can pause to note two objections. First, some will protest that what’s happening in the economy today, like it or not, is just the workings of the free market, and the free market is sacrosanct. But as we have seen, it wasn’t the free market that did this—it was the unfree market. And even if it had been the workings of the free market, at some point, we must realize that the interests of the nation as a whole must come first. Contrary to what some ivory-tower dwellers might wish, America is not a theory; it is a nation of 320 million flesh-and-blood citizens who have the God-given right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. If you think America is just a theory, then please explain how Americans came to fight and die in such real-world places as Belleau Wood and Bastogne—and explain where their rifles and tanks came from.\nThe second objection is stronger. It argues, frankly, that even if the market is shafting ordinary Americans, well, there’s nothing to be done, because the government is too inept to do anything about it—and any attempt will only make things worse.\nAdmittedly, this is a strong critique. In fact, the US government, especially in the last half century, has been mostly grossly incompetent, sometimes even outright malevolent. There’s no excuse to be made for the total folly of, for example, the War on Poverty—or the War in Iraq.\nYet a longer look at American history tells us a different, and more hopeful, story. In the past, at least, the government has been a reliable engine of economic activity. We can cite, to name a few success-stories, the Erie Canal, the Transcontinental Railroad, the Tennessee Valley Authority, Hoover Dam, the Interstate Highways, cruise missiles, and, yes, the Internet. This author has even cited the US Department of Agriculture; today it might be the butt of jokes, but once upon a time, it was an effective agent for work-based uplift and empowerment.\nThe pattern, in other words, seems to be that the government is more effective at “hard” Hamiltonian projects that create work, as opposed to “soft” Great Society-type programs that create welfare. And while there’s never a guarantee that the promises of tough-minded Hamiltonianism won’t degenerate into promiscuous welfarism, we, the people, have the capacity to keep our eye on the ball if we want to. So it’s likely that we can succeed in keeping the economic-development effort robust if we really try: Just in the last few decades, for example, the federal government successfully introduced drones for the warfront, as well as GPS on the homefront. So it’s not hopeless. We can do better. Indeed, given the downward slope of the last few decades, if we want our country to continue, we had better do better.\nTo put it another way: It’s just common sense to have a plan to get everyone working and being productive. And if that violates the tenets of a precious ideology, well, then, it’s not, in fact, a very good ideology.\nYes, the American Dream should be open to all those who are willing to work for it. Just as the policies that led to the concentration of wealth were deliberate, there’s no reason why the policies that would lead to un-concentration couldn’t be just as deliberate.\nBut first, obviously, we will need new leadership.\n###\nPart One of this series.\nPart Two of this series.\nPart Three of this series.\nPart Four of this series.\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wants a re-instatement of the assault weapons ban after a terrorist killed 50 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.\nDuring an interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo, Clinton called for a reinstatement of the assault weapons ban.\n“We did have an assault weapons ban for ten years,” she said. “I think it should be reinstated.”\nDuring an interview with the Today Show, she added, “Let’s keep weapons of war off our streets like the one that was used in Orlando.”\nClinton criticized Florida’s gun laws, blaming legislatures for not regulating assault weapons, 50 caliber rifles, or large capacity ammunition magazines. She also blamed Florida for not requiring a permit to purchase a gun, not requiring gun registration, and not requiring gun owners to be licensed to carry a shotgun or a rifle.\n“We know the gunman used a weapon of war to shoot down at least 50 innocent Americans and, you know, we won’t even be able to get the congress to prevent terrorists or people on the no-fly list from buying guns,” she said.\nClinton demanded more gun control to stop mass shootings, reminding viewers that the mass shooting in Orlando was the worst in American history.\n“Yes, there is a right for law-abiding, responsible Americans to own guns and, yes, there are reasonable common sense measures to try to keep people safe from guns,” she said. “We have to figure out the best way to move forward on that. That’s what I’m committed to doing.”\nClinton condemned gun rights groups after they “scared the heck out of voting officials” on gun control.\n“We cannot fall into the trap set by the gun lobby that says if you can’t stop every shooting and every incident, you should not try to stop any,” she said. “That is not how laws work. it’s not common sense.”\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"At his Monday national security address, Donald Trump called for a common- sense, “mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values,” and denounced Hillary Clinton’s “radical immigration policy” that only benefits special interests.\n“What I want is common sense. I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values,” Trump declared. “That is the choice I put before the American people: a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America, or Hillary Clinton’s radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically-correct special interests.”\nTrump focused particularly on the impact that large-scale Muslim migration will have on the LGBT community:\nHillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn’t share their views. She can’t have it both ways. She can’t claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress them. How does this kind of immigration make our life better? How does this kind of immigration make our country better? Why does Hillary Clinton want to bring people here—in vast numbers—who reject our values? Ask yourself, who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with his actions, or Hillary Clinton with her words? Clinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country—they enslave women, and murder gays. I don’t want them in our country. Immigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn’t support our communities – all of our communities.\nTrump explained that it is radical and dangerous for Clinton to push to expand the nation’s already record high rate of immigration:\nEach year, the United States permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East, and many more from Muslim countries outside the Middle East. Our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our security. In fact, Clinton’s State Department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas. Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500% increase in Syrian refugees. This could be a better, bigger version of the legendary Trojan Horse. We can’t let this happen.\nTrump pointed out that the Orlando attack was only possible due to Muslim immigration. The gunman, Omar Mateen, was the child of Afghan migrants. Trump explained that there was no reason Mateen’s father should ever have been admitted to the United States in the first place– as he had expressed support for the Afghan Taliban and said he was running for President of Afghanistan. Trump said;\nImmigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five-fold in just one year. According to Pew Research, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law. Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you’d be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children… The media talks about “homegrown,” terrorism, but Islamic radicalism, and the networks that nurture it, are imports from overseas.Yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of the poor policies of the past. But the whole point is that it will be much, much easier to deal with our current problem if we don’t keep on bringing in people who add to the problem. For instance, the controversial Mosque attended by the Boston Bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot. This shooter in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on Earth. Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?\nTrump declared that the burden is on Clinton to explain why she wants to expand record-high immigration levels, which will transform American communities and jeopardize national security:\nThe burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in. The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans. The burden is also on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it. Her plan will cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term. Wouldn’t this money be better spent on rebuilding America for our current population, including the many poor people already living here?\nTrump observed that immigration is not simply an issue of national security, but also financial security:\nAmerica has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny. Not surprisingly, wages for our workers haven’t budged in many years. So whether it’s matter of national security, or financial security, we can’t afford to keep on going like this. We owe $19 trillion in debt, and no longer have options. All our communities, from all backgrounds, are ready for some relief. This is not an act of offense against anyone; it is an act of defense.\nYou can read the full text of Donald Trump’s speech here.\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"The terrorist attack in Orlando that ended 49 lives is another reminder of the threat we face from Radical Islam. There is a deadly element of Islam spreading like a cancer throughout our country and we must unite to confront it.\nDemocrats’ bludgeoning of Americans with political correctness has weakened our resolve. Their hesitation to confront Radical Islam, or even utter the term, has emboldened the jihadists – and not for the first time.\nDuring Bill Clinton’s presidency, Islamic terrorists perpetrated the following attacks against America: 1) 1993 World Trade Center bombing; 2) 1996 Khobar Towers; 3) 1998 Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania; 4) 2000 bombing of the USS Cole. Each attack was followed with little to no response. The terrorists felt victorious. They felt invincible. And even worse, they did not fear us. This of course culminated in the 9-11 attacks. Ironically, the day before 9-11, President Clinton told an audience that he “could have killed” September 11th mastermind Osama Bin Laden in 1998. The next day, 2,977 Americans were killed by Bin Laden’s Al-Qaeda terrorist group.\nUnder the Obama presidency we have endured attacks on Ft. Hood, Benghazi, Boston, Chattanooga, San Bernardino, and now Orlando. In 2009, President Obama referred to the massacre at Ft. Hood that killed 13 Americans as “workplace violence”. Benghazi was blamed on a “YouTube” video. At every turn, President Obama and Hillary Clinton have been soft on terror and refused to utter the words “Radical Islam” as the jihadist death march against America continues. President Obama even naively referred to the Islamic State as a “JV team”. Incredibly, he and Hillary Clinton are now calling for increasing Syrian refugees to America despite known ISIS pledges to exploit the program and universal agreement that we cannot vet these individuals – how delusional.\nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton have irresponsibly exploited terror attacks to further the agenda of Democrats by calling for things such as gun control. Maybe Secretary Clinton has never heard of suicide bombers. Perhaps she forgets that nearly 3,000 Americans were murdered on 9-11 without a single shot being fired. We cannot afford another terror denier as commander in chief.\nHistory repeats itself. Their political correctness and willful blindness leaves them talking in circles and Americans dead. In typical fashion, Hillary delivered a speech on Monday blaming the Orlando terror attack on gun control. There were some words about combating terrorism, but if Hillary is going to have credibility, the Clinton Foundation should stop accepting blood money from countries that export terror, oppress women and persecute gays.\nDonald Trump has promised to use every tool at our disposal to go after Radical Islam. He speaks to Americans with unequivocal clarity at a time when clarity is required. Americans know that Mr. Trump is right when he says we must “now get very tough, very smart and very vigilant.” His plan to temporarily suspend immigration from areas with a “proven history of terrorism” could not be any more common sense. I filed a bill to temporarily suspend the refugee resettlement program last December for the same reason.\nPresident Obama will say that rhetoric from some on the right is dangerous, but what’s more dangerous is sitting idle as Islamic Extremists slaughter innocent Americans. America cannot afford another four years of willful blindness in the fight against Radical Islam. President Obama and Hillary Clinton continue to endanger American lives with their politically correct assault on our common sense. We need a decisive leader who will act in the best interests of this country to keep Americans safe. We need Donald Trump.\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"When Donald Trump first proposed that the immigration of Muslims be halted temporarily, many suggested — perhaps almost reflexively — that any such move would be illegal.\nMore recently, when he suggested that being a Muslim might be a factor in decisions affecting national security and protection from terrorism, it was widely suggested — perhaps in some cases by people who think that anything new and different which they oppose must be unconstitutional — that any such policy would violate the U.S. Constitution.\nFinally, some have seemingly gone further, and suggested that either policy — or, indeed, any policy which considers religion as a factor — is somehow un-American.\nWhile I am not a supporter of Trump (or of any other politician) nor of any of his specific plans, it is clear to me that all of this labeling is unwarranted and probably incorrect.\nIndeed, as a law professor who has sat on the liberal seat on CNN’s Crossfire more often than on the conservative seat, and who has won over 100 legal actions against various different types of illegal discrimination, I write to say that:\nI. Limiting or even prohibiting immigration by Muslims is not illegal\nII. Considering religion as a factor in formulating anti-terror policy and tactics is not necessarily unconstitutional\nIII. Profiling — which is widely supported — can hardly be considered to be un-American\nI. Limiting or Even Prohibiting Immigration by Muslims Is Not Illegal\nCurrent federal law [Title 8, Section 1182 of the U.S. Code, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952] gives the President legal authority to suspend — by a simple proclamation, and without any action by Congress — the entry of “any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States [who] would be detrimental to the interests of the United States,” and to do so indefinitely. President Obama has in fact already used this power.\nThis existing statutory grant of authority to the President, and to those to whom he may delegate this power, is very broad, and a very recent Supreme Court decision held that he could withhold visas on national security grounds without providing any reason at all. Thus, even without any action by Congress to give him additional authority, it is likely that the President could at least temporarily ban immigrants who are Muslim.\nIf Congress were to back this proposal by enacting specific legislation to carry it out, the case for its legality would be even stronger. And there is clear precedent. Indeed, over a period of more than 100 years, Congress has repeatedly limited immigration by many different groups of people seeking admission. The 1924 Immigration Act (targeting those from Southern and Eastern Europe) and the Chinese Exclusion Act (aimed at Chinese) are only two examples.\nOne simple reason why our country has frequently singled out people by race, nationality, and perhaps even religion for immigration purposes is that we can; because not all the rights guaranteed by the Constitution apply to non-Americans outside the country. Here’s why:\nUnder what has been called the Plenary Power Doctrine, at least some of the protections guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution do not apply to non-citizens living abroad and seeking admission to the U.S. Law Professor Eric Posner of Chicago Law School described the doctrine this way:\n“The Supreme Court has held consistently, for more than a century, that constitutional protections that normally benefit Americans and people on American territory do not apply when Congress decides who to admit and who to exclude as immigrants or other entrants. This is called the plenary power doctrine. The Court has repeatedly turned away challenges to immigration statutes and executive actions on grounds that they discriminate on the basis of race, national origin, and political belief, and that they deprive foreign nationals of due process protections. While the Court has not ruled on religious discrimination, it has also never given the slightest indication that religion would be exempt from the general rule.”\nAfter quoting Prof. Posner, Law Professor Eugene Volokh, of the UCLA School or Law, adds that following: “I would add that, in Kleindienst v. Mandel (1972), the Supreme Court applied the ‘plenary power doctrine’ to the exclusion of people based on their political beliefs, despite the Free Speech Clause. The cases that Posner is referring to, together with Kleindienst, suggest that the exclusion of people based on their religious beliefs is likewise constitutional.”\nMoreover, the Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected claims that immigration statutes which discriminate on the basis of race, national origin, or political belief are unconstitutional. Therefore for these reasons, and for some additional ones cited below, it seems very clear — and something few legal scholars would doubt — that the immigration of persons who are Muslims can be halted, at least temporarily, without violating the Constitution.\nII. Considering Religion as a Factor in Formulating Anti-terror Policy and Tactics Is Not Necessarily Unconstitutional\nSo what happens when we try to move beyond the limited area of immigration, where virtually everyone agrees that non-Americans abroad are not entitled to the same constitutional guarantees, and seek to consider religion in making other decisions: e.g., added scrutiny by the TSA when boarding airline flights.\nThe answer appears to be the same, especially when we consider the crucial difference between racial or religious profiling (which is unconstitutional) and terrorist profiling (which can be constitutional). Failure to understand this crucial difference, and a tendency to think narrowly just in terms of phrases and labeling, is apparently what has led many to overgeneralize, and assume that any consideration of race or religion whatsoever is wrong and unconstitutional, at least when it occurs domestically.\nA classic example of unconstitutional racial profiling occurs when police, intent on making a dent in the drug trade, decide to primarily stop African Americans traveling down a major highway, based upon the assumptions that blacks are much more likely to be transporting drugs than whites. If Rastafarians rather than blacks were singled out, it would constitute religious profiling. Both would clearly violate the Equal Protection clause of the U.S. Constitution.\nBut the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Justice Department have recognized that there are exceptions to the general rule prohibiting decision making based upon factors like race or religion.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has held on several occasions that governments may take into account factors such as race (and presumably religion), provided that the decision serves a compelling governmental interest, and that the factor is only one of several considered.\nThat, after all, is the basis upon which, under so-called affirmative action, the Supreme Court has held that state colleges may discriminate on the basis of race in determining who is to be admitted. They may do so because achieving racial diversity in classrooms is, according to the Court, a compelling state interest. Thus, so long as other factors are also considered, and race is not the sole defining characteristic, it may be considered in making these important governmental decisions.\nHowever, because preventing mass murder by terrorists is at least as much a compelling governmental interest as achieving diversity in the classroom, courts have also recognized that the same exception which permits race or religion to be considered alone with other factors regarding college admissions also applies to preventing terrorism. In summary, while it would be unconstitutional to subject people to additional scrutiny to deter illegal drug sales solely because they happened to be African Americans or Rastafarians. it would not be unconstitutional to single out people for additional terrorism scrutiny based in part on their belief in Islam, provided that other factors were also considered.\nThis is hardly in doubt. For example, the Department of Justice [DoJ] under President Obama likewise publicly recognizes that, while so-called racial (and similar) profiling is illegal and probably unconstitutional in many situations, exceptions exist with regard to both preventing terrorist attacks, and in controlling who enters the country.\nConsider that its recent guidance provides that: “in conducting activities directed at a specific criminal organization or terrorist group whose membership has been identified as overwhelmingly possessing a listed characteristic, law enforcement should not be expected to disregard such facts in taking investigative or preventive steps aimed at the organization’s activities.”\nIn other words, since terrorists overwhelmingly (but not necessarily all) possess the characteristic of being Muslim, TSA and other law enforcement agencies can consider this factor, among others, “in taking investigative or preventive steps aimed at the organization’s activities.”\nIn addition, while Justice Department guidelines prohibit as unconstitutional any consideration at all of factors like race or ethnicity in routine police enforcement activities (e.g., traffic stops, drug interdiction, etc.), they did expressly provide that: “in investigating or preventing threats to national security or other catastrophic events (including the performance of duties related to air transportation security) . . . Federal law enforcement officers may not consider race or ethnicity except to the extent permitted by the Constitution and laws of the United States.”\nSo, since they may not consider race “except to the extent permitted by the Constitution and law of he United States,” there must be some extent to which such consideration is constitutional.\nAnother major federal agency which has not only recognized that terrorist- (as contrasted with racial-) profiling can be constitutional, but which has also actually engaged in it, is the TSA. It was not selecting for so-called secondary screening all passengers equally — i.e., treating a young Muslim male as presenting the same probability of being a terrorist as an elderly Asian female or a child — but rather deliberately selecting for secondary screening all citizens of 12 named countries. Aside from two communist nations, all of the others have large Muslim populations, including 8 which are at least 90% Muslim.\nSince this could hardly be just a mere coincidence, it provides still another example where Americans, believing that it was constitutional to do so, have engaged in religious profiling.\nIII. Profiling — Which Is Widely Supported — Can Hardly Be Considered to Be Un-American\nThe idea of profiling Muslims, at least to some extent, can hardly be considered to be un-American, especially when polls show strong support for it; when it is a centerpiece of a political campaign which allowed Trump to overshadow all of his opponents; and when so many other leading political figures generally regarded as mainstream also have expressed support for it.\nFor example, Governor Jeb Bush stated that the U.S. should “absolutely” be profiling in order to prevent Islamic terrorists from being admitted to the U.S. Senator Ted Cruz has said the U.S. should accept Christian refugees but not Muslims. Rep. Peter King, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, said “This is not profiling. This is common-sense policing we have to do.”\nEven Hillary Clinton, asked about profiling in the context of “How far do we go, for instance, on airline security?,” answered: “Well I think we have to do whatever it takes . . . . we are in a war situation, and we’re going to have to do things people do in times of war.”\nMoreover, President Barack Obama and Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer both said that NYPD’s Ray Kelly would make a good secretary of Homeland Security despite his extensive anti-terrorism programs which many said unnecessarily targeted Muslims and their mosques based solely on religion. So, at least by inference, both Democratic leaders seemed to be endorsing some profiling of Muslims as reasonably necessary to protect us from terrorist attacks.\nSomething which has widespread (albeit minority) support among both our general population and our political and other leaders can hardly be said to be un-American; a label properly reserved for those ideas or proposals which are so abhorrent that no reasonable American would dare advance them.\nReturning to slavery, seeking to exterminate Jews or American Indians, summarily executing anyone thought to be selling drugs, etc. are certainly ideas which properly deserve to be termed un-American. But executing convicted murders, performing abortions within current legal guidelines, possessing so-called assault rifles, hunting animals, etc. cannot rationally be considered un-American, even by those who most strongly oppose them.\nPerforming abortions is not un-American although many say it constitutes murdering the unborn; executions are not un-American just because many oppose them and consider them to be state-sanctioned murder; and although many would like to ban hunting which they see as barbaric and even bloodthirsty, all recognize that those on the other side have valid arguments, and are not necessarily un-American simply because of a strong disagreement of views on certain issues.\nThe same seems to be true with regard to restricting the immigration of Muslims and/or considering religion as one factor among several in making decisions regarding programs designed to protect us from terrorists. Those opposed can characterize the proposals as misguided, wrongheaded, and perhaps discriminatory and/or demeaning, but not as so far beyond the pale of rational discourse so as to be called un-American.\nIV. Practical Considerations and One Application — Airport Screening\nJust because a program or policy is constitutional does not mean it should be put into practice. For example, it may be seen as unfair and unreasonable, as going to far, as too expensive or extreme, or even as counterproductive — for example, many argue that any such policies would alienate American Muslims whose support we urgently need, upset many of our foreign allies with major Muslim population, etc. But is there room for reasonable compromise?\nFor example, while banning all Muslims from boarding all airplane flights, as a step towards limiting terrorist activity, would probably been seen as unreasonable, excessive, and overkill, making them somewhat more likely to be selected for secondary screening may not be. Both common sense, and a very careful mathematical study based upon the well established science of testing and selections, shows that the current policy of asking young Muslim men to go though secondary screening no more frequently than elderly Asian females — treating them as though both presented exactly the same theoretical or statistical risk — is nonsensical.\nSelecting for secondary screening those who have a statically higher probability of being terrorists — e.g., those who are Muslim and/or Arab and/or male and/or a young adult — would make the screening process much more efficient and effective: i.e., more likely to deter terrorists, and to utilize fewer resources and reduce delays.\nThose with a very low probability of being terrorists — e.g., elderly Asian females, young children, etc. — would still be subject to some occasional secondary screening, but at a lower rate. Older Muslims, especially females, would be selected somewhat more often, and young Muslim men would be selected the most often.\nFurthermore, not all young Muslim males — those whose probability of being selected would be the highest — would have to undergo secondary screening, but it would certainly happen more often that it does now when they are treated the same as elderly Asian females.\nFor what it’s worth, I at least don’t think such a policy would be unfair or unreasonable, embarrassing or demeaning, etc., and I ask you to consider the following hypothetical. Suppose I, a white person, was living and working in South Africa. Suddenly an extremist group of whites, intent on restoring the country to white rule, begins using suicide bombers to bring down airplanes, and threatens to continue the practice until whites are again in power.\nI, as a white person, would certainly hope that secondary screening would be concentrated on white passengers, including me. This would greatly reduce my chances of being blown up in flight. It would also significantly reduce the time I have to spend on security lines at airports because the authorities would not waste as much time on secondary searches of the majority of passengers who are black because there is a very low probability that they would be willing to blow themselves up for the sake of white power.\nV. Practical Considerations and a Second Application — Admitting Refugees\nIt may well be impractical and indeed overkill to ban all non-American Muslims from entering the country, even temporarily. Moreover, although refugees may present a much greater risk than other visitors because their papers and other documentation are more likely to be inconclusive and perhaps even unreliable, it may also be impractical to ban all refugees who are (or appear to be) Muslims, as some people have suggested.\nHowever, in cases where a refugee’s background and possible identity as a terrorist cannot be reliability determined, and their status as a Muslim creates enough anxiety such that they would ordinarily not be admitted, there might be an alternative to completely refusing them admission, or admitting them and thus taking a chance that they might be a terrorist.\nFor example, rather than barring such Muslims, or ignoring the risks posted by admitting Muslim refugees about whom there isn’t any conclusive evidence, some — especially young males with, for example, prior criminal convictions and/or who have recently visited Syria or other suspect areas — could be given a choice of not being admitted, or of agreeing to wear a ankle GPS-based monitor. Such a device would alert authorities to their location (both in real time, and retroactively during any subsequent investigations), or provide an immediate warning if the device were removed.\nSuch ankle monitors, which are already widely used in the U.S. for persons suspected (but not proven) of having committed a crime — would substantially reduce a problem law enforcement officials now face — both here and abroad – of lacking sufficient manpower and other resources to keep track of the movements of all persons who are under suspicion of possibly being terrorists, but where there isn’t yet enough evidence to act. The Orlando killer, as well as those in Paris, are clear examples of such situations.\nAn ankle bracelet which can be covered by trousers during most of the day isn’t terribly demeaning or embarrassing, and wearing it would seem preferable to being denied admission to a country because of suspicions which cannot be resolved. Indeed, in a slight modification of the hypothetical previously proposed, suppose I were a white person seeking to visit or even to settle in South Africa at a time when there was grave concern that any white person might engage in terrorist activities to further the aims of a white separatist group seeking to unseat the current black government.\nGiven that situation, and a choice of being denied admission to the country or of having to wear an ankle bracelet, I would be overjoyed to be able to choose the latter. Surely my new friends and colleagues in South Africa would understand and probably sympathize with the need to monitor the whereabouts of persons such as myself as to whom there might be any reasonable suspicion. As a law abiding citizen, I would not be greatly troubled if my whereabouts were known and even kept track of. Indeed, while I might much prefer to be admitted without any restrictions, I would probably see an ankle bracelet as a reasonable compromise — the lesser of two evils — that I could understand and live with.\nIn Conclusion\n1. There is little doubt that the U.S. could constitutionally limit immigration based upon religion.\n2. Precedents strongly suggest that considering religion as only one of several factors in dealing with the treat of terrorism would likewise not be unconstitutional\n3. Profiling based upon religion, although disturbing and objectionable to many, can hardly be considered to be so far beyond the pale as to be un-American, considering that it is supported by so many ordinary Americans, as well as many of their leaders and agencies.\n4. There may be compromises regarding this issue which would be acceptable to most Americans, and perhaps even to many Muslims.\nUPDATE: After this piece was submitted, the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed that it is constitutional to use race (and presumably also factors such as religion) to achieve important government goals. Since preventing terrorist attacks is far more important than increasing classroom diversity beyond that already achieved by the University of Texas in admitting all students who graduated in the top 10% of their high school classes (including overwhelmingly black schools), this decision appears to open the door even wider to considering factors such as religion when reasonably necessary to do so.\nJohn F.

"2008 Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin blasted supporters of the #NeverTrump faction from a stage Friday in Denver for fueling Hillary Clinton’s path to victory with “dynamite” as she called them on the carpet, “You’re either with us or you’re against us.”\nFormer Alaska Governor Palin spoke of the growing “movement” that picked Donald Trump as their champion. Palin’s opening message before presumptive GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump addressed the Western Conservative Summit took aim at “the GOP wing of the good ol’ boys club” and their plans to “throw in for Hillary against the will of the people in their own primary” or “stay home instead of vote because their guy didn’t win this time around.”\n“It doesn’t matter to the beltway bubble boys and girls which side actually wins elections as long as they get to keep their titles and their ratings and their power and their purses full, they win and we lose,” explained Palin. “Hillary thanks them because she cannot win without them.”\n“They call themselves the never hashtag … I just call them Republicans Against Trump, or RAT for short,” she quipped.\nPalin pointed to the resolute will of the movement, “We drove over those desperate darts flying at our frontrunner like the critics crying, “Trump’s not conservative enough!”\n“What would they know about common sense conservatism? What does handing Obama a blank check to run up trillion dollar deficits with no end in sight and pushing endless wars with no path to victory and inviting millions of unveiled illegals through our swiss cheese borders to replace American workers and wanting amnesty for millions of new Democrat voters, what’s that got to do with conservatism?”\nPalin pointed a finger at members of the party’s establishment for characterizing Trump supporters as angry:\n“The Establishment, those profiles in pudding, they bent over for all those things and now they fret about ideological purity? Well they got busted. So they panicked and then they started feeding the left this idea that, well all we had to fuel this movement was anger. Really that’s some gall that they’re lecturing us that we’re too passionate? About our country? Yeah they stomp on our neck and then tell us to just chill out? Well darn right voters are mad. It’s righteous indignation. But what the profession political class really can’t handle is knowing really that the movement is more than anger. It’s an optimistic, sensible, building up the people agenda. And that is good change, but to them it’s a threat. You know who’s threatened? Those GOPers who insist that they’ll never vote for their Party’s choice this time.”\nIndeed, while heavy aggression has manifested from leftist protesters outside of Trump rallies, the mood within the walls of Trump rallies has remained largely positive and enthusiastic.\nPalin continued further, emphasizing the pivotal nature of the presidential race:\n“Folks we’re talking about our sovereignty here, our solvency and security, our entire invaluable system of law and order in a republic bought with patriots’ and vets’ blood, sweat and tears,” she said. “This isn’t a game, nor some drama to be played out on the convention stage. No they’re playing with dynamite and arming those opposed to the planks in the platform upon which [President Abraham] Lincoln and [President Ronald] Reagan stood. We’re talking about the direction of our country, our children’s future, the direction of the Supreme Court, all of this hinging on the next election and at such a time as this, you cannot be lukewarm. We’re gonna take our country back and you’re either with us or you’re against us.”\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"If elected president, Hillary Clinton could permanently resettle close to one million Muslim migrants during the first term of her presidency alone, according to the latest available data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\nBetween 2001 and 2013, the U.S. permanently resettled 1.5 million Muslim migrants on green cards. However, under Hillary Clinton’s stated proposals, Muslim immigration would grow substantially faster, adding nearly one million Muslim migrants to the U.S. during her first term alone.\nBased on the most recent available DHS data, the U.S. permanently resettled roughly 149,000 migrants from predominantly Muslim countries on green cards in 2014. Yet Clinton has said that, as President, she would expand Muslim migration by importing an additional 65,000 Syrian refugees into the United States during the course of a single fiscal year. Clinton has made no indication that she would limit her proposed Syrian refugee program to one year.\nClinton’s Syrian refugees would come on top of the tens of thousands of refugees the U.S. already admits from Muslim countries.\nAdding Clinton’s 65,000 Syrian refugees to the approximately 149,000 Muslim migrants the U.S. resettled on green cards in the course of one year, means that Clinton could permanently resettle roughly 214,000 Muslim migrants in her first year as President. If Clinton were to continue her Syrian refugee program throughout her Presidency, she could potentially resettle as many as 856,000 during her first term alone.\nAnalysis from the Senate Immigration Subcommittee found that Clinton’s plan to expand refugee resettlement could cost U.S. taxpayers over $400 billion.\nAdditionally, once Clinton’s Syrian refugees are in the U.S. as green card holders, they will have the ability to bring over their family members through chain migration.\nWith regards to Middle Eastern migration, Clinton’s 65,000 Syrian refugees would be added on top of the roughly 96,000 Middle Eastern migrants the U.S. resettled on green cards in a single year. Based on the minimum numbers Clinton has put forth thus far, as President, she could potentially resettle approximately 644,000 Middle Eastern migrants during her first term alone.\nAccording to a September 2015 Rasmussen survey, women voters oppose Clinton’s Middle Eastern refugee plan by a remarkable 21-to-1 margin. Democrat voters oppose Clinton’s refugee plan by a 17-to-1 margin. Most remarkably, 85 percent of black voters oppose Clinton’s refugee agenda– with less than one percent of black voters supporting her plan.\nYet Clinton’s expansion to Muslim migration would be in addition to her expansion for immigration overall.\nU.S. Census data shows that if a President Hillary Clinton were successful in passing a Gang of Eight-style immigration expansion bill, the U.S. could permanently resettle roughly 9.4 million migrants throughout the nation during her first term alone. This figure does not include the additional 11 million illegal immigrants already here to whom Clinton has promised amnesty and U.S. citizenship.\nClinton’s desire to expand immigration is shared by GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan, who leads the pro-Islamic migration wing of the Republican Party.\nRyan has championed policies to expand Muslim migration into the United States. Ryan has repeatedly ruled out the possibility of curbing Muslim migration and has frequently chastised his party’s presumptive nominee for advocating policies to reduce immigration.\nAt times, Ryan has even echoed Clinton’s rhetoric in his efforts to denounce Trump and Trump’s proposals.\nIn recent weeks, Ryan has come under fire in his own Wisconsin district for continuing to support Islamic migration, and voting to expand Islamic migration, despite the fact that seven out of ten Wisconsin GOP voters would like a Muslim migration pause.\nPaul Ryan has a two-decade long history of supporting open borders immigration policies, even though, according to Pew polling data, 92% of GOP voters and 83% of American voters overall want to see immigration levels frozen or reduced.\nIn stark contrast to Paul Ryan and Hillary Clinton’s support for open borders, Donald Trump has called for a common sense “mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.”\n“That is the choice I put before the American people: a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America, or Hillary Clinton’s radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically-correct special interests,” Trump said following the Orlando terrorist attack, carried out by the child of Afghan migrants.\nTrump continued:\nClinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country—they enslave women, and murder gays. I don’t want them in our country. Immigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn’t support our communities – all of our communities… The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in. The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans. The burden is also on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it. Her plan will cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term. Wouldn’t this money be better spent on rebuilding America for our current population, including the many poor people already living here? […]\nAmerica has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny. Not surprisingly, wages for our workers haven’t budged in many years. So whether it’s matter of national security, or financial security, we can’t afford to keep on going like this. We owe $19 trillion in debt, and no longer have options. All our communities, from all backgrounds, are ready for some relief. This is not an act of offense against anyone; it is an act of defense.\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

House Majority Leader Paul Ryan (R-WI), Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) will also speak. View the full convention schedule here.\nAll times eastern.\n—\n11:01: Convention now adjourned.\n10:57: The founder of American Muslims for Trump Sajid Tarar asks the audience to pray for a strong America that fights terror.\n10:55: Brown says the “left wants to silence those they disagree with” in politics, on college campuses and in business. She says she has been attacked on social media since she was announced as a speaker. She says Trump is the most qualified man to turn around the nation. She says Trump is America’s best opportunity to return to greatness.\n10:51: Brown not talking about trade as an actress and an avocado farmer. She says she has seen TV and movie productions move out of the country because of high taxes and regulations that hurt sound techs and cameramen and others doing production work. She says when she was an actress she didn’t understand what the local union folks were talking about but now she does. She says as an avocado grower, she has seen the domestic market flooded with imports that have driven some farmers out of business. Brown says Trump raised these concerns before the elites and he’ll make trade deals that benefit working men and women and their families “right here in America.” She says there will be a time for a woman president, but let’s be clear–the Democrats offer up a woman who when she had a chance to stand up for women, did not do so.\nBrown says she personally know victims and they find Clinton’s “remarks and actions repulsive.”\n10:46: Kimberlin Brown says she’s offended when they are Democrats “typecast us as single-issue voters.” Brown speaking about how Obamacare has forced some of her employees off of their health care plans and onto Obamacare. She speaks about not going with paychecks to ensure her employees were paid and says that’s the story of small business owners across America. She says Obamacare has become a “wake-up call” to all of her young employees and they are all voting Republican this year.\nKimberlin Brown, former soap actress now avocado grower, is now speaking. #rncincle\n— Ted Johnson (@tedstew) July 20, 2016\n10:38: Carson says he has learned that one of Clinton’s heroes/mentors was Saul Alinsky. “This was someone she greatly admired… and that affected all of her philosophies subsequently.” Carson says Alinsky’s “Rules for Radicals”/Clinton’s hero acknowledges Lucifer. Carson says he is proud to support Donald Trump, whom he calls “the right leader for a time such as this.” He says now is the time to rise up and take America back as Thomas Jefferson said the people should do when they recognize what they were about to lose.\nBen Carson: Hillary Clinton's role model ""acknowledges Lucifer"" https://t.co/KjpeNheq0X #RNCinCLE https://t.co/L13dqVAmNN\n— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) July 20, 2016\n10:36: Carson says Clinton would appoint Supreme Court Justices and federal judges and that will have a “deleterious” effect for generations and continue an education system that harms young people, keeps them dependent so they can be “cultivated for their votes.”\n10:35: Carson says he is “not politically correct And I hate political correctness because it’s antithetical to the founding of the country… and the secular progressives use it” to get people to shut up and sit down. Carson says we must resist the narrative some people are pushing the Clinton will only impact America for eight years. Carson says American may never recover from eight years of Clinton.\n10:34: Dr. Ben Carson gets a tremendous ovation. “Don’t eat up my time,” he jokes to the audience.\n10:26: Sen. Shelley Moore Capito says Clinton has profited from closed-door speeches that paid her fees that would buy several houses in West Virginia while having the laws bend in her favor for the last 30 years. She says Clinton doesn’t realize her calculated policies impact real people. She says Clinton can’t be trusted with classified information or to play by the same rules as everyone else. She says nobody who has lost the trust of the American people should serve as our president.\n#WestVirginia delegates holding yellow 'Trump Digs Coal' signs while their Senator Shelley Moore Capito speaks #Gop pic.twitter.com/SAdhOPL19A\n— CBSDFW (@CBSDFW) July 20, 2016\n10:17: Donald Trump says his dad won’t use the highest office in the land for personal enrichment and has actually created job and signed the front of a paycheck and has people’s lives dependent on the success of his companies and does not need focused-grouped analytics to form a simple opinion.\n10:15: Trump Jr. is railing against Clinton’s vow to take away gun rights and asks how that’s working in Chicago. He says the city’s gun control laws failed because criminals don’t follow laws.\nDonald Trump Jr.: ""Hillary Clinton is a risk Americans can't afford to take"" https://t.co/KjpeNheq0X #RNCinCLE https://t.co/07g1Q44hzJ\n— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) July 20, 2016\n10:08: Donald Trump Jr. says his father didn’t hide behind a desk but spent time with workers and valued their opinions more than people from Harvard and Ivy League schools. He says his dad has promoted people based on work ethic and street smarts instead of paper credentials. He says some of the top executives in Trump’s organization are people who started out in blue-collar jobs but Trump saw potential in them. He says Trump sees potential in people that they don’t often see in themselves. He says other other executives ignore such qualities in favor of degrees from fancy schools. He says that is why he feels more comfortable in a Caterpillar tractor than a golf cart. Donald Trump Jr. says he learned more from people who go PhDs in common sense. He says our schools used to be an elevator to the middle class, now they are stalled on the ground floor. Trump Jr. says Dems. fear the free market because they care more about protecting the jobs of tenured teachers than serving students in desperate need of a good education. He says Dems. don’t understand their policies have caused poverty. Trump also says Sanders was right when he said immigrants drive down wages.\n10:04: Donald Trump Jr. wants to talk about the country our children will grow up. He says for too long, our country has ignored problems and punted them down the road. He says that’s why we need to elect a man who has a track record of accomplishing the impossible. He says Trump is motivated when people say something is impossible. He says they said Trump couldn’t go from Queens to New York and he ended up changing NY’s skyline. He says he saw that look in his eye when they said he couldn’t succeed in politics.\nGreat to see @DonaldJTrumpJr again today! #RNCinCLE #PAGOPinCLE pic.twitter.com/g5hecadwAH\n— PA GOP (@PAGOP) July 20, 2016\n360 view of the #RNCinCLE floor as Donald Trump Jr speaks. #nbc2016 #decision2016 https://t.co/5anfO8aXAc\n— Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) July 20, 2016\n10:00: Kerry Woolard speaks about how Trump revived the Virginia winery.

LOCK HER UP!”\nHe denounces Clinton for failures in Libya and creating ISIS. Christie says Clinton fought for two years to keep an Al-Qaeda affiliate off of the terrorist watch list in Nigeria. He said these terrorist abducted hundreds of school girls and they are still missing today. He says the Obama/Clinton team’s solution was a “hashtag campaign.”\n“She fights for the wrong people,” he says.\nChristie says Clinton was so desperate for Chinese r that she promised to oppose the “buy American” provision in the stimulus bill. She put Chinese financiers ahead of good-paying jobs for Americans.\nHe’s now blasting Clinton for calling Syria’s Assad a “reformer” and “different kind of leader.” He says there are now 400,000 dead at the hands of the man Hillary defended.\nChristie attacks Clinton for the Iran deal.\nChristie: Clinton guilty or not guilty as inept negotiator of worst nuclear arms deal (Iran)?

He says Republicans believe in an America that only works when “we put your interests above the special interests.”\n9:18: House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) thanks Cleveland for looking after them this week. He also wants to thank the men and women from law enforcement who are here for your service. Ryan says “it all has a familiar feel” standing on stage. He says it was a great honor to be the VP nominee in 2012 even though things didn’t work out well. He says he will be right at the rostrum with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence during the next State of the Union address. Ryan says the Dem. convention will be four days of “moralizing” and it is a reminder of all that is at stake this election. He says 2016 is the year America moves on from the Obama/Clinton years. Ryan also says “progressives deliver everything except for progress.” He is not talking about a “contest of ideas” and says when it’s about ideas, the “advantage goes to us.”\n[Ryan sounds like he is checking off a list of things to read. He has a tough time not coming off as impersonal.]\nRyan says Republicans can show poor American a way beyond persistent poverty, a way that shows poor Americans a world behind “liberal warehousing” and “check-writing.” He says it’s “all on the line” this election.\n.@SpeakerRyan: Watch the DNC next week, that four day infomercial of politically correct moralizing. #RNCinCLE pic.twitter.com/Ou1D2ptuNG\n— FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) July 20, 2016\n9:12: Mitch McConnell (some boos) points out Clinton lied about her email server, lied about Benghazi and even lied about why her parents named her Hillary. He says Trump will bills Republicans pass unlike Obama, who has vetoed things like the Keystone Pipeline.

He says today has been a “very special day” and is something he will never, ever forget. He says this stage of the presidential process has come to a close “and together we’ve achieved historic results.” He says “this is a movement” but “we have to go all the way.” Trump says he looks forward to sharing his thoughts on Thursday. He says it’s an honor to run on a ticket with Gov. Mike Pence. Trump vows to win Ohio and win the presidency and bring “real change” and “leadership” back to Washington. He says he will put American people first, rebuild our depleted military, take care of veterans, bring back jobs, have strong borders, restore law and order, and get rid of ISIS.\n9:03: LPGA superstar Natalie Gulbis (great choice as a character witness) wants to speak about a man she admires and found to be gracious, generous and inspiring. Gulbis says that when she earned her tour card 16 years ago, she was told there were only two things you shouldn’t talk about in public–politics and faith. She says she is going to violate that rule today at the RNC as a Christian woman. Gulbis says she has always wanted to own a Boys and Girls Club and felt that she was treated unfairly as a woman. Trump helped her open up her own Boys and Girls Club. Trump, she says, encouraged her to be “fearless” and to think of herself as a businessperson instead of a female athlete.\nGulbis, who defended Michelle Wie back in the day when people were piling on her, says Trump remains a consistent voice who reminds her to stand up to gender injustice and lean in to any challenge that comes her way.\nIn #RNCinCLE arena: #NatalieGulbis: ""#DonaldTrump remains a consistent voice to stand up to gender injustices."" pic.twitter.com/DfSPOoMka7\n— Kelly Petryszyn (@kelly_pet) July 20, 2016\n8:57: The NRA’s Chris Cox says Clinton says the Supreme Court is wrong about the Second Amendment and after Justice Scalia’s death, a Clinton presidency “means your right to own a firearm is gone.” He says this election is about the “next forty years” and sitting it out is “not an option.” He says Clinton has been protected by a good guy with a gun for the last 30 years and she has never had to dial 9-1-1 when in danger. Cox says American women are the fastest-growing group of gun owners.\n8:52: Sen.

He says the Constitution requires that the President swears to faithfully execute the office and preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. He says Clinton took a similar oath when she became Secretary of State and violated it.\n8:37: Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge says that Clinton is still “poor” in all the ways that count–poor judgement, poor policies, and poor decisions. She says Clinton is a lawyer but she acts like the law doesn’t apply to her. She says, as her dad would say. “Hillary would lie even when the truth would server her better.”\n8:35: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson says “strength” and “new energy” are things not associated with Hillary Clinton. He says if you liked the last eight years, Clinton will give you double trouble.\n8:30: UFC President Dana White says he wants to tell the audience about the Donald Trump that he knows. He says nobody took him seriously except for Trump. White says Trump encouraged him to build his business and saw UFC’s potential and got in the trenches. He says he stands with Trump tonight because he stood with UFC before it was a success. White says Trump has great business instincts, is a hard worker, and is a loyal and supportive friend. White says you can tell a lot about someone like Trump by how happy they are when others succeed.\nUFC Pres. Dana White: ""I will always be grateful"" to Donald Trump https://t.co/A6r3ywA8Si #GOPConvention #RNCinCLE https://t.co/9c9m5ROlkw\n— CNN (@CNN) July 20, 2016\nHe says he knows fighters and Trump will fight for this country.\n8:25: RNC Co-Chair Sharon Day asks the audience to wonder what it would like to have Clinton as president. She says businesses would suffer and industry would be destroyed. She says honesty, ethics, and integrity would be taught in history class because the values of this country would become history. She slams Clinton for hypocritically playing the gender card when as Senator she paid women less than men and then as Secretary of state lied to the mothers, wives, and daughters of those who died in combat. She slams her foundation for accepting donations from country’s that oppress women. She also slams Clinton for viciously attacking the character of “women who were sexually abused at the hands of your husband” as First Lady.\n8:22: House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) formally declares Donald Trump and Mike Pence the GOP nominees for President and Vice President of these United States.\nJUST IN: @SpeakerRyan formally declares @realDonaldTrump and @mike_pence the GOP nominees https://t.co/NWqPgwj3q3 https://t.co/YdXlAtM8aF\n— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) July 20, 2016\n8:12: Indiana Lieutenant Gov.

He says it was lonely for a bit but “no more.” He says the “sleeping giant of the American spirit has been awakened.” He says Trump is a remarkable man of “uncommon strength, uncommon determination, accomplishment, and vision.” McMaster says “there’s something happening here. What it is precisely here. We are going to make America great again with Donald Trump. Thank you and God bless you.”\n5:59: Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY) thanks Sessions for standing with him in support of Trump. He says Western New York has been devastated by “unfair trade deals” that have allowed Mexico and China to “steal our jobs.” He says we have been losing under Barack Obama. Collins says the federal government is trampling on our rights while our country has no borders. “Enough is enough,” he says. “It’s time to take back our country. The great United States of America.” He says Trump is not just a candidate but a “movement.”\n5:58: Sessions says it is his distinct honor and great pleasure to nominate Donald Trump for the office of the presidency of the United States of America.\n5:53: Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) says Americans love our country “like no other people on earth. But we have gotten off course. And the American people know it. Our political system is not working.” He says good Americans want the political games to end. Sessions slams Obama for blaming the police while crime is rising. He blasts the political, corporate, and media establishments for being politically correct. He says Trump was not intimidated and “he would not be silenced. He spoke the truth. He gave voice to the people’s concerns.” He mentions Trump’s opposition to bad trade deals and support for law and order and police officers. Sessions says voters reward Trump’s courage.

It’s not Bernie’s. It’s not Warren’s. It’s not Clinton’s. And Obama’s not on the top of the ticket this fall.]\n11:34: Obama ripping Trump, saying that’s why anyone who threatens our values–“whether fascists or communists or jihadists or homegrown demagogues, will always fail in the end.” He says Hillary Clinton is a “fighter” and “stateswoman” and “patriot” gets this and “that’s the America she’s fighting for.”\n[Obama paying Bill back for what he did in 2012 with interest with this speech.]\n11:32: Obama says his grandparents from the heartland taught him people didn’t like bullies and braggarts but valued honesty [The problem is Americans don’t think Hillary Clinton is honest or trustworthy.]\nFirst time Obama has allowed us to see hives all over his neck. The intelligence briefing must be really bad. #DemsInPhilly\n— MATT DRUDGE (@DRUDGE) July 28, 2016\n11:28: Obama, referencing Teddy Roosevelt, says Clinton is that person “in the arena” and voters need to get in the arena with her. He says democracy isn’t about “yes, he will” but is about “yes, we can.” [thunderous roars.]\n11:18: Obama says “America is already great” and “our greatness doesn’t depend on Donald Trump.” Obama says Ronald Reagan called America a “shining city on a hill” while Trump calls America a “divided crime scene.” Obama (who enacted executive amnesty), speaking of Trump, says “we don’t look to be ruled.” Obama now says we can “honor police” and “treat every community fairly.” Obama says Clinton knows that acknowledging problems that have been “festering for decades” is not making racism worse. He says Clinton also will push amnesty because the dreams of illegal immigrants is “quintessentially American.” “And the American Dream is something no wall will ever contain,” he says.\n[Obama didn’t get the message to be boring so Hillary could have a low bar to jump over.]\n11:10: “Don’t boo, vote,” Obama says after crowd boos Trump. Obama says Trump calls himself a business guy and says he knows plenty of businessmen and businesswomen who have succeeded without leaving a trail of lawsuits. Obama asks if anyone believes someone who has spent 70 years not caring about working people is going to be the voice of working Americans. Obama says Hillary Clinton is respected around the world. “People outside of the United States do not understand what’s going on in this election,” he says. “They really don’t.” [Democrats sounding too “global”again. Americans don’t care what people in other countries think.] Obama claims Clinton is “fit” and “ready” to be the next Commander-in-Chief. He blasts Trump for calling “our military a disaster.”\n[Erickson Thanks Obama.]\nAnd thank you Mr President for noting Donald Trump is neither Republican nor conservative.\n— Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) July 28, 2016\n11:00: Obama says no matter how daunting the odds and no matter how much people try to knock her down, she never ever quits. [Perhaps because she has wanted to be president all her life.] Obama again says there has never been someone more qualified to serve as president of the United States than Hillary Clinton. “I hope you don’t mind, Bill,” he says. “I’m just telling the truth.” Obama says Tim Kaine is as good as man as anyone he knows and will make Clinton a better president like “brother” Joe has made him a better president.\n.@POTUS: ""There has never been a man or a woman, not me, not Bill, nobody more qualified than HIllary Clinton"" https://t.co/e02P4b5sjL\n— ABC News Live (@ABCNewsLive) July 28, 2016\n11:06: Obama says Hillary Clinton is the only candidate in the race who believes in the future he described. Obama says he was “worn out” when he fought Clinton for the nomination in ’08. He says she was doing everything backwards and in heels like Ginger Rogers. Obama says he realized Clinton was in this for everyone who “needs a champion.”\nThis is as much an ""I'm With Her"" speech as it is a ""Damn, I wish I could run a third term"" speech. #DNCinPHL\n— Jerome Hudson (@JeromeEHudson) July 28, 2016\n11:02: Obama says it’s fair to say “this is not your typical election.” Obama says this election is a choice about “who we are as a people.” Obama said what we heard in Cleveland wasn’t “conservative” or “Republican.” He speaks about the fanning of resentment, hate, and anger. He says the America he knows is full of optimism and courage and decent. He says as he has traveled across the country, he has seen “what is right with America.” [Obama, unlike Bill Clinton (who may have purposefully been boring), is going to make it tough for Clinton to follow his speech tomorrow.]\n10:59:\nIf there ever should be anti-TPP signs, it would be at this moment.

Obama says he addressed this convention for the first time 12 years ago in Boston. Obama says he’s more optimistic about the future of America than ever before after two terms in the White House. “How could I not be?” he asks. “After all that we’ve achieved together…”\n[How vigorously will the media fact-check his claims?]\n10:45: President Barack Obama getting ready to close out day three. Obama enters to his U2 campaign music. It seems like he would have liked to have run against Trump.

His speech is similar to the one he gave on Saturday. He says he trusts Clinton with his son’s life. He mocks Trump for saying “believe me” after all of his promises. He is blasting and mocking Trump for not releasing his taxes. “Hey Donald, what are you hiding?” Kaine says we must battle against the “dark force” that is Trump. “You cannot believe one word that comes out of Donald Trump’s mouth,” he says. “NO TPP” signs seen in audience as Kaine speaks as anti-TPP Dems interrupt his speech.\nSign battles: When anti-TPP signs go up, so too do Clinton-Kaine signs pic.twitter.com/JFYorAZjO5\n— Joseph Spector (@GannettAlbany) July 28, 2016\nLots of anti-TPP signs in the crowd pic.twitter.com/PDICBWL7Of\n— Shane Goldmacher (@ShaneGoldmacher) July 28, 2016\nKaine calls Trump a “one-man wrecking crew” and quoting Barbara Bush and other Republican establishments to make the case against Trump.

Biden says Clinton’s life story is of someone who has “always been there. And so has Tim Kaine…. and that’s not Donald Trump’s story.” He tells the crowd to listen to him without “booing or cheering.” He slams Trump’s “lack of empathy” and compassion. “How can there be pleasured in saying, ‘you’re fired?'”… Biden says it’s a “bunch of malarkey” that Trump cares about the middle class. Biden says Trump has “no clue” about the middle class or what makes America great. “He has no clue, period.” He says no major party nominee in the country’s history has known less and been less prepared re: national security.\n9:12: Joe Biden:\n.@VP Joe Biden on Pres., Michelle Obama: ""We're now family"" https://t.co/mJYW1jxVBi #DemsinPhilly https://t.co/5ljrvWSWZ9\n— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) July 28, 2016\nWATCH NOW: VP Biden recalls his late son Beau, receives standing ovation from #DemsInPhilly https://t.co/tyoJ9W5h2L pic.twitter.com/Vb8p83TcTr\n— Yahoo News (@YahooNews) July 28, 2016\n.@BernieSanders applauds during @VP Joe Biden's #DemsinPhilly speech https://t.co/UiyaOtDWR0 #DemsinPhilly pic.twitter.com/DX5b0XpV66\n— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) July 28, 2016\n9:10: Dems. trying to bring order to disunited convention:\nNo more war chanters holdings up iPhone lights to protest DNC cutting their lights pic.twitter.com/WVLxEELOvV\n— Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) July 28, 2016\nDNC has turned off the stage lights in the chanting sections to make them less visible on TV\n— Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) July 28, 2016\n9:09: Yikes.\nCrowd chanting ""USA!

The America I know is decent and generous. Sure, we have real anxieties – about paying the bills, protecting our kids, caring for a sick parent. We get frustrated with political gridlock, worry about racial divisions; are shocked and saddened by the madness of Orlando or Nice. There are pockets of America that never recovered from factory closures; men who took pride in hard work and providing for their families who now feel forgotten. Parents who wonder whether their kids will have the same opportunities we have.\n“All that is real; we’re challenged to do better; to be better. But as I’ve traveled this country, through all fifty states; as I’ve rejoiced with you and mourned with you, what I’ve also seen, more than anything, is what is right with America. I see people working hard and starting businesses; people teaching kids and serving our country. I see a younger generation full of energy and new ideas, unconstrained by what is, and ready to seize what ought to be.”\n—\n“You know, nothing truly prepares you for the demands of the Oval Office. Until you’ve sat at that desk, you don’t know what it’s like to manage a global crisis or send young people to war. But Hillary’s been in the room; she’s been part of those decisions. She knows what’s at stake in the decisions our government makes for the working family, the senior citizen, the small business owner, the soldier, and the veteran. Even in the middle of crisis, she listens to people, and keeps her cool, and treats everybody with respect. And no matter how daunting the odds; no matter how much people try to knock her down, she never, ever quits.\n“That’s the Hillary I know. That’s the Hillary I’ve come to admire.

"JANESVILLE, WI — Wisconsin businessman Paul Nehlen blasted House Speaker Paul Ryan for his “repeated betrayals” of both Republican nominee, Donald Trump, and the American electorate, who “who want a leader that will put the interests of America and her citizens first.”\n“Paul Ryan’s repeated betrayals of the GOP nominee is beneath the dignity of the Speakers’ office and is morally disqualifying,” Nehlen declared.\nNehlen’s statement follows Ryan’s decision to join “Hillary Clinton and the establishment media in rebuking Trump’s common sense immigration proposals” with his Sunday statement regarding the Khan family. Ryan then chose to “attack Trump’s trade policies” at an “elite donors retreat” hosted by the Koch brothers.\n“Paul Ryan has shown more passion in attacking Trump than he has ever shown in defending Americans,” Nehlen wrote.\nIn particular, Nehlen highlighted Ryan’s refusal to even acknowledge the victims of his open borders immigration agenda — such as the “angel moms” whose children were murdered by illegal aliens.\n“Speaker Ryan only cares about the deaths of innocent Americans so long as their deaths comport with donors’ desired narrative,” Nehlen said. “Paul Ryan took an oath and swore to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, but his only loyalty is to money, his only allegiance to his donors, and the only issue that he’s ever cared about is the expansion of his own personal power.”\nNehlen added that, “Throughout this election cycle, the American people made themselves resoundingly clear. In nominating Mr. Trump, they voted for borders, they voted for trade deals that protect American jobs and wages, and they voted to defend national sovereignty. On all of these issues, Paul Ryan finds himself firmly against the American people… on these critical issues, Paul Ryan sides with Hillary Clinton and his corporate donors.”\nEarlier on Tuesday, Donald Trump announced that he is “not quite” ready to endorse Speaker Ryan in his primary election.\n“I like Paul, but these are horrible times for our country,” Trump said in an interview with the Washington Post. “We need very strong leadership. We need very, very strong leadership. And I’m just not quite there yet. I’m not quite there yet.”\nTrump noted that Nehlen is “running a very good campaign”.\nAs Breitbart News has previously reported, Nehlen is running on a pro-America platform arguing, in contrast to Ryan, that the needs of American citizens should be a Congressman’s first priority. If elected, Nehlen would likely join the pro-America wing of the GOP Congress led by Sen. Jeff Sessions and Congressman Dave Brat.\nBy contrast, Speaker Ryan is the ideological leader of the globalist wing of the Republican Party. Ryan emphasizes that the needs of foreign citizens are equal to the needs of American citizens. In fact, Ryan has previously suggested that U.S. lawmakers must put themselves in the shoes of foreign citizens and then put forth legislative proposals that would best serve the interests of these foreign citizens. Ryan’s view, which is dominant among the GOP establishment, reflects the belief that Americans are only part of many interest groups that a Congressman ought to consider when crafting legislation—even as he negotiates with other countries, which always put their citizens first.\nAlready, Speaker Ryan has massively outspent Nehlen. Indeed, Ryan has nearly $10 million at his disposal in his campaign war chest.\nRyan has used these funds to flood the district with, what Nehlen has described as, “dishonest” ads designed to convince voters that Ryan is committed to securing America’s borders and curbing Islamic migration. In reality, Ryan has a two-decade-long record of supporting expansive immigration policies. Ryan is, in fact, the leader of the anti-borders movement in Congress.\nNehlen has managed to significantly close the gap in polls despite virtually no national or local media coverage, sabotage by the state party, and nearly no support from Washington conservative media figures like Mark Levin.\nDespite all of these significant obstacles to Nehlen’s insurgent campaign to unseat the Republican House Speaker, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has described Ryan’s campaign against his pro-America primary challenger as potentially Ryan’s “toughest fight yet.”\nNehlen’s statement on Ryan’s “repeated betrayals” can be read in full below:\nRepublican House Speaker Paul Ryan has spent months working against his Party’s nominee and the American people, who want a leader that will put the interests of America and her citizens first.\nPaul Ryan’s repeated betrayals of the GOP nominee is beneath the dignity of the Speakers’ office and is morally disqualifying.\nPaul Ryan has shown more passion in attacking Trump than he has ever shown in defending Americans.\nWhether you are a Republican or a Democrat, it’s hard to disagree with the fact that Ryan’s efforts to undermine the Republican nominee—while pretending to have endorsed the nominee— is the kind of two-faced dishonest politics that has caused Americans of all political stripes to come to loathe Washington D.C.\nFollowing his statement on the Khan family— in which Ryan joined Hillary Clinton and the establishment media in rebuking Trump’s common sense immigration proposals— Ryan then opted to use the Koch brothers’ elite donors retreat to attack Trump’s trade policies in order to push his own globalist economic agenda, which is wildly out of step with voters across party lines in Wisconsin’s first Congressional District.\nPaul Ryan took an oath and swore to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, but his only loyalty is to money, his only allegiance to his donors, and the only issue that he’s ever cared about is the expansion of his own personal power.\nWisconsinites are entitled to honest and principled leaders— not politicians who will say anything, do anything, or lie about anything to deliver for their wealthy financial donors.\nThroughout this election cycle, the American people made themselves resoundingly clear. In nominating Mr. Trump, they voted for borders, they voted for trade deals that protect American jobs and wages, and they voted to defend national sovereignty.\nOn all of these issues, Paul Ryan finds himself firmly against the American people.\nPaul Ryan has spent two decades championing his donors’ open borders agenda, opposed by the American electorate. On these critical issues, Paul Ryan sides with Hillary Clinton and his corporate donors.\nBeltway and media elites have praised Paul Ryan for his statement regarding the Khan family, in which he denounced Donald Trump’s immigration policies. But where was Paul Ryan’s statement rebuking Hillary Clinton after grieving parents, whose children were killed by murderous illegal aliens, said that Clinton-backed policies were to blame for their children’s deaths?\nWhen four “angel moms” came to Ryan’s guarded estate and stood in front of his personal border wall to tell their stories, Paul Ryan ignored them.\nIn fact, Paul Ryan fled from these mothers. Why? Because their families’ tragedies did not comport with Ryan and his donors’ open borders immigration agenda.\nAs these angel moms explained in a letter they tried to deliver to Speaker Ryan, if “Paul Ryan only cared as much about us as he cares about his donors” we might “have been spared” from our loss.\nApparently, Speaker Ryan only cares about the deaths of innocent Americans so long as their deaths comport with donors’ desired narrative.\nThe stakes of Wisconsin’s August 9th election cannot be more clear.\nOne week from today, the voters of Wisconsin have the chance to take back their government and reclaim the people’s house. On August 9th, with one vote, Wisconsin voters can stop amnesty. With one vote, Wisconsin voters can save the lives of countless innocent Americans. With one vote, Wisconsin voters can stop TPP. With one vote, Wisconsin voters can save the entire nation from globalism. With one vote, Wisconsin voters can take back our district from the special interests who own Paul Ryan. With one vote, Wisconsin voters can stop Ryan’s lies, his disdain, his deceit and his betrayals.\nAugust 9th is Wisconsin’s Independence Day.\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"Hillary Clinton has tried to save herself from her latest email scandal with rhetoric that poses a dangerous threat to our democracy and even world peace.\nThis new email scandal is the Wikileaks release of a gaggle of DNC emails that prove the Democrat primary race was rigged in establishment Hillary’s favor. She’s tried to make herself the victim once again, blaming the Russians and—bizarrely—Donald Trump for the hack that set the emails free.\nI have some news for Hillary and Democrats—I think I’ve got the real culprit. It doesn’t seem to be the Russians that hacked the DNC, but instead a hacker who goes by the name of Guccifer 2.0. The original Guccifer famously hacked Hillary’s home email server, you might remember.\nHere’s Guccifer 2.0’s website. Have a look and you’ll see he explains who he is and why he did the hack of the DNC.\nNow, ask yourself: Why is Roger Stone the guy showing you this? This website isn’t hidden but of course our pathetic press patsies haven’t reported it; they just keep repeating Hillary’s spin.\nBefore I tell why Hillary’s dishonest blame-casting is so dangerous, let me explain a little more about why it seems like Guccifer 2.0 is the real deal. He seems to have set up a Twitter account back in June and then a WordPress blog to let the world know that he’d hacked the DNC.\nHi! I'm on Twitter now! this is my official account! #Guccifer2https://t.co/6aN2WqCnRL\n— GUCCIFER 2.0 (@GUCCIFER_2) June 20, 2016\nA month before Wikileaks released any info, Guccifer 2.0 put up a bunch of documents to prove that he’d really done the hack.\n#Guccifer2 New docs from #DNC: financial reports, donors' personal data. Here you are! https://t.co/P9yEt9qOOa pic.twitter.com/JcjjzPadVA\n— GUCCIFER 2.0 (@GUCCIFER_2) June 20, 2016\nWanna know more about #Guccifer2 ?\nSend ur questions via DM & you'll see answers in my bloghttps://t.co/bPyJJlsA3R\n— GUCCIFER 2.0 (@GUCCIFER_2) June 22, 2016\nFAQ from #Guccifer2 Here u can find answers to the questions & some new docs as a bonushttps://t.co/SOWWu9uAI5 pic.twitter.com/JGCd18YPb0\n— GUCCIFER 2.0 (@GUCCIFER_2) June 30, 2016\nThen Guccifer 2.0 even did an interview going into detail about how they had done the hacking and tried to get some media traction but the media wasn’t biting. Someone from The Hill did a piece, but that was about it. For some strange reason, the establishment press didn’t want to take on the establishment Democrat machine.\nSo then, his Twitter feed tells us, Guccifer 2.0 made a fateful and wise decision. He went to Wikileaks with the DNC files and the rest is history. Now the world would see for themselves how the Democrats had rigged the game.\n@wikileaks published #DNCHack docs I'd given them!!! #HillaryClinton #DonaldTrump #BernieSanders #Guccifer2 https://t.co/TXFAySUKWw\n— GUCCIFER 2.0 (@GUCCIFER_2) July 22, 2016\nWe all know what happened at the Democrat convention — the anger, the outrage and the ouster of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was promptly hired by Hillary.\nHillary and her team were desperate to change the conversation … and never forget, her team includes most of the media.\nHillary didn’t deny what this new email scandal plainly showed. The story about the rigged Democrat machine wasn’t going to help Hillary and Trump was starting to overtake her in the polls. Clinton and her minions needed SOMETHING.\nInspiration stuck: ignore Guccifer 2.0. The DNC being hacked by one person didn’t look sinister enough. Time for the victim card! Blame the Russians! Blame Putin! Blame Trump!\nNo, it didn’t make any sense. Yes, the evidence about Guccifer 2.0 was already out there. But it’s good to the be the Queen.\nNow, common sense would inform most sane people that if Russia were dong what Hillary says they were doing they simply would have gone straight to Wikileaks. However, common sense didn’t fit Hillary’s narrative and so the press went all in with her fable.\nIt’s not shocking that Hillary would try to deflect after the fiasco at the Democrat National Convention.\nIt’s not shocking but it is incredibly dangerous. Let me explain.\nRemember when the Clinton’s close family friend Anthony Weiner pulled this same exact trick when Andrew Breitbart nailed him for sending a photo of his bulging underwear to a young lady who was not his wife? (And his wife is Hillary Clinton’s top aide, Saudi-raised Huma Abedin, you’ll recall.)\nAnthony was caught red-handed (double entendre intended) so he played the victim card and found someone else to blame. The Democrats are following the Weiner playbook, trying to cast doubt and lay the blame anywhere they can. They have even announced an FBI investigation.\nThey should save the money for the charade. I just told you about Guccifer 2.0.\nOf course, the mainstream media is once again playing along with the Democrat’s blame game, just like they did with Anthony Weiner. Of course. That’s why they didn’t tell you about Guccifer 2.0.\nUnfortunately, this time the stakes are much, much higher. You see, what Hillary is doing is downright dangerous.\nThink about it. While Weiner tried and ultimately failed to cast blame on Andrew Breitbart, Hillary is actually increasing international tensions by blaming a whole COUNTRY in addition to her Presidential rival.\nHow bad could it get? Very, very bad.\nIf I said that Hillary was making a mistake of nuclear proportions, the media haters would accuse me of trying to start World War III.\nSo because I am by nature a shy and humble man not given to brash statements, I won’t say that Hillary seems to be taking us down a road to nuclear confrontation with Russia with her politically motivated shenanigans.\nInstead, I’ll let an expert say it for me.\nFor the sake of you and your family’s safety, I implore you to take five minutes to listen to the sober, serious words of Professor Stephen Cohen, an acclaimed author and expert who teaches Russian history and politics at York University and Princeton.\nProfessor Cohen has no connection to either the Clinton or Trump campaign, which is why his statement against Hillary and her lapdog media is so throughly blistering.\nCohen says that Obama and Clinton have started a new Cold War with Russia. You can see it in places like Syria and the Ukraine. Cohen sees a potential bright spot, one that the media doesn’t want to admit:\nThen along comes, unexpectedly, Donald Trump who says he wants to end the New Cold War, and cooperate with Russia in various places and –astonishingly– the media is full of what only can be called neo-McCarthyite charges that he is a Russian agent, that he is a Manchurian candidate, and that he is Putin’s client.\nCohen continues, astounded that in an election year the media has completely abdicated on their professional duties.\nWe’re approaching a Cuban Missile Crisis level nuclear confrontation with Russia and there is absolutely no discussion, no debate, about this in the American media.\nThen the Professor delivers the death blow, pointing out the false narrative that tries to brand Trump a “Russian agent” with Professor Cohen pointing out “most of it is coming from the Clinton campaign. And they really need to stop.”\nThe media is too busy trying to get Hillary Clinton elected to present the facts to the American people.\nDue to his lies and deflection, Weiner was forced to publicly apologize. Frankly, with the pickle she’s put America in, Hillary Clinton needs to go a few steps further than that. She’s the least qualified person ever to seek the Presidency and a woman whose political career is due almost entirely to having been married to Bill Clinton.\nThe stakes are just too high for Hillary’s dangerous foolishness. And it really needs to stop.\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"Jonathan Easley writes at the Hill:\nDonald Trump hammered Hillary Clinton on trade and immigration at a rally in Michigan on Friday, as he made the case that Democrats’ policies have failed the black community.\nThe speech was notable in that Trump used a teleprompter – something he’s done in the past for major policy addresses, but has rarely been seen at his massive rallies. He also used a prompter at Thursday’s rally in Charlotte, N.C., and the GOP nominee seems to be growing more comfortable reading from a screen.\nSome of Trump’s earlier speeches were stilted or stiff, but on Friday he was smoother and at times he left the script to improvise without going too far off track.\n“Hillary Clinton is a legacy of death, destruction and terrorism,” Trump said, reading from prepared text. “America deserves a better legacy. All of you deserve a better future. I am the change agent.”\nThe GOP nominee then broke from the teleprompter to personally address the crowd.\n“I am your messenger … nothing more than your messenger,” he said. “It’s a message of strong defense, common sense, take care of our vets, great education, get rid of Common Core, great healthcare, get rid of ObamaCare, save our Second Amendment, which is under tremendous siege. Hillary Clinton is the defender of the status quo, or what we have.”\nTrump was dressed down at the rally, wearing a white “Make America Great Again” hat and no tie, noting that he was fresh off a plane from Louisiana where he and running mate Mike Pence had toured devastation from flooding in the state.\nRead the rest of the story here.\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"The media is suddenly full of stories on Trump’s “Mormon problem.” According to the mainstream media, Trump’s call for “extreme vetting” of Muslim immigrants in his foreign policy speech kicked open a hornets’ nest of Mormon concerns about “religious tolerance.”\nThe truth is more simple, as is often the case in politics, and it has nothing to do with religious freedom as practiced by Americans under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\nIt is an open secret in Washington, D.C. that the Mormon church supports open borders and lax enforcement of immigration laws. Many Mormon politicians have been supporting amnesty and open borders for decades. When I was in Congress I had a confrontation with former Utah Senator Robert Bennett over his sponsorship of an amendment to exempt religious institutions from a Sanctuary City bill establishing penalties for harboring illegal aliens. It turned out he did it at the request of his church leaders. Mormon church support for John McCain in his Arizona Republican primary race is also due in large part to his open borders record and his challenger’s strong criticism of McCain’s hypocrisy on border security.\nSo, no one should be surprised that Trump’s call to build a wall on the southwest border and his plan for putting the war on Islamist terrorism above open immigration has encountered resistance among some Mormon politicians. What is surprising is the dishonest way even some Republicans have framed that disagreement as opposition to infringement on religious liberty.\nISIS leaders must be rolling in the mosque’s aisles in uncontrolled laughter over the Mormon concern over Muslim immigration, considering that religious liberty is the first casualty wherever radical Islam and Sharia are enforced.\nUnder Sharia law enforced by orthodox Muslims wherever they have the power to do so, religious liberty is defined as giving Christians and Jews and other “infidels” a choice: either convert to Islam, pay the “Jizya” tax, or die. That is religious liberty under Islam, and it bears no resemblance to the religious liberty guaranteed by the US Constitution.\nTrump is advocating a new policy of vigorous, effective screening of Muslim refugees and immigrants to identify likely Islamist terrorists and bar their admission to our country. So, how did a ban on admission of likely terrorists become a war on religious liberty? Once you find a good answer to that question, my friends, you will have discovered the answer to the riddle of political correctness run amok.\nImmigration restrictions based on national security concerns are not new. Maybe liberals and progressives do not want to remember it, but during the cold war against international Communism, America had laws restricting immigration from the Soviet Union and a dozen communist nations. Why is a ban on admission of Islamist terrorists any different?\nWhy is it suddenly an affront to religious liberty to say with Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson, “The Constitution is not a suicide pact”? Justice Jackson’s famous phrase was in dissent to a 1949 Supreme Court ruling striking down a Chicago ordinance prohibiting incitement to riot. But the same common sense sentiment was expressed by a Supreme Court judge appointed by President John Kennedy, Arthur Goldberg, when he said in 1962, “Congress has broad power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact legislation for the regulation of foreign affairs. Latitude in this area is necessary to ensure effectuation of this indispensable function of government.”\nThe truth is that not only does the Constitution NOT prohibit immigration restrictions on persons holding beliefs hostile to public safety and national security, there are several US Supreme Court decisions upholding Congress’s and the President’s powers to put the nation’s safety and security ahead of any alleged universal right of foreign nationals to enter the United States. Suggestions to the contrary, whether expressed by Sharia advocate Khizr Khan addressing the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia or Mormon Senator Jeff Flake stirring up opposition to Donald trump in Arizona, is pure demagoguery and ought to be called by its right name no matter where it occurs.\nA clear-eyed look at the current presidential campaign suggests to me that the extent of Mormon opposition to Donald Trump is being exaggerated by the hostile media and some “Never Trump” opponents. The recent announcement by an ex-CIA agent of the Mormon faith, Evan McMullin, that he will wage a candidacy as an independent candidate for president, is not generating a tidal wave of support in Utah or anyplace else.\nNonetheless, the statements of some Mormon leaders raising the specter of religious persecution if immigration of radical Muslims is banned, is poisonous to intelligent debate over immigration policy. But then again, this is not new: the open borders lobby has never wanted to allow intelligent debate on the issue and has always tried to slander proponents of border controls.\nGovernor Herbert of Utah has been pouring kerosene on the smoldering fire by trying to link immigration policy to religious persecution. The former LDS missionary recently said, “I am the governor of a state that was settled by religious exiles who withstood persecution after persecution, including an extermination order from another state’s governor. In Utah, the First Amendment still matters. That will not change so long as I remain governor.”\nThe clear implication in the Governor’s message is that Trump’s plan to bar Islamist jihadists from entering our country is somehow akin to proposals 150 years ago to bar Mormon immigration. Most likely, the average Mormon citizen in Utah or Nevada or Ohio will make that same connection when it comes to Muslim jihadists: No, barring jihadists is not religious persecution.\nIndeed, most Mormon Republicans are lining up in support of Trump despite the frenzied effort to slander him as proposing religious persecution. Utah Governor Herbert, the Utah state Republican party chairman, and Senator Jason Chaffetz have all said they intend to vote for Trump. Out west, only Nevada Senator Dean Heller is waging an open jihad against Trump.\nWill the “Mormon issue” be a major obstacle for Trump’s campaign? The answer is, not unless sheer demagoguery triumphs over common sense. Mormons worship the US Constitution and its guarantee of religious liberty. Radical Islam is the number one enemy of religious liberty in the world today. Probably 99% of Mormon citizens and voters can make that logical connection — even while their church leadership suffers an episode of moral incoherence.\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will participate in NBC’s “Commander-in-Chief forum” tonight. Matt Lauer, who was a prominent member of the Clinton Global Initiative, will moderate the event. Trump, who has a commanding 19-point lead among military voters, won the coin toss and elected to go second.\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for live updates.\nAll times eastern.\n—\n9:32: Priebus: Hillary “angry” and “defensive” because “she was caught wrongly sending our secrets.”\n@HillaryClinton was angry + defensive the entire time – no smile and uncomfortable – upset that she was caught wrongly sending our secrets.\n— Reince Priebus (@Reince) September 8, 2016\n9:17: Seems very petty that Clinton’s rapid response team is criticizing Trump for saying that 22 veterans commit suicide a day as opposed to 20. Trump pointed to the higher number to highlight the seriousness of the issue.\n9:08: On MSNBC, a corporal says he was satisfied with Trump’s answers. But he says he wishes that both candidates would have addressed the homelessness among veterans. He points out that we send billions to Iran and send millions on Syrian refugees, and some of that money could be better spent on ending homelessness among veterans.\n8:55: Trump says he Clinton has a “happy trigger” and there will be “no greater burden” than possibly sending American troops into war. Trump says we have to make America great again but we have to make America “strong again.”\n8:52: Lauer says nobody would have expected Trump to take “deep dives” into these issues. He asks what types of things Trump is reading and what kind of homework he is doing now. Trump says he has “a lot of hats right now”and he is “studying” and meeting constantly with generals and other experts. He says he has learned but has a lot of common sense to deal with these issues. Trump insists he will be prepared to handle these issues and cites Clinton’s mistake on Libya. “She made a terrible mistake on Libya,” Trump says. Trump says he has “great management talent” and points out that he has found these subjects to be of “tremendous interest” all throughout his life.\n8:50: Trump is asked what he would do to support all victims of sexual assault in the military. Trump says it is a “massive problem” and the “numbers are staggering.” He says “we have to come down very, very hard on that” and wants to keep the court system within the military. He says right now, the court system “practically doesn’t exist.” Lauer conveniently has opposition research/follow-up question with Trump’s Tweet from years ago.\n8:49: Trump is asked what he will do to stop 20 veterans from killing themselves daily. Trump points out that it is 22 veterans a day, showing some substance. He says he will create a great “mental health division” and the VA is a “corrupt enterprise.” Trump points out that the VA can’t even fire the people who were caught stealing in Arizona.\n8:45: Trump is now asked about his remarks about Putin [Trump must be careful not to let his insecurity and his desire for affection from anyone show here]. Lauer asks if he wants to be complimented by a former KGB officer. Trump says he will “take it” if Putin calls him brilliant. Trump says the fact that Putin calls him “brilliant” will have “zero impact” on him. Trump says “if he says great things about me, I’m going to say great things about him.” He says Putin has been a better leader than Obama. He cites Putin’s high approval rating.\nTrump on Putin: ""If he says great things about me I'm going to say great things about him."" Seconds earlier said complements had no impact.\n— Benjy Sarlin (@BenjySarlin) September 8, 2016\n8:42: Questioner asks Trump if an “undocumented person” who serves in the military will be allowed to stay. Trump says the military is a “very special” thing and it would be a “special circumstance.”\n[Trump needed to prepared to answer this question better. Should be a wake-up call to him and his team for the debates. It isn’t rocket science to figure out the types of questions that will be asked in these settings.]\n8:38: Lauer presses Trump on his plans–or lack thereof. Trump says he has a “significant chance” of winning and doesn’t want to broadcast to the world his plan for defeating ISIS. He says Obama telegraphs when we are going to leave Iraq and he won’t make the same mistake.\n8:36: Questioner, a Democrat, asks Trump what is next if we defeat ISIS so another group doesn’t spring up. Trump points out that Iraq was “somewhat stable” before Obama took over and led to the formation of ISIS. Trump says Iran will be taking over Iraq now and he says that he has always said that we shouldn’t be there but we should have taken the oil. Trump says ISIS would not have come into power if we had taken the oil.\n8:35: Lauer asks Trump whether he knows more about ISIS than the generals. He says the generals “have been reduced to rubble” under Clinton and Obama. Trump says he has great faith in the military but he has not faith in Hillary Clinton and the current leadership. Trump points out that Clinton has been in the system for 30 years and “we need change.”\n8:33: Lauer asks whether a Commander-in-Chief should keep saying stuff that he later regrets. Lauer says Trump could spark conflicts, destabilize regions, and put American lives at risk and asks if Americans can afford to take that risk with Trump.\n8:32: Lauer asks Trump what he has experience in his personal or professional life that has prepared him to be Commander-in-Chief. He cites his experience building companies and dealing with nations that are ripping America off. He talks about Russian planes and Iranian boats taunting the U.S. Trump says he has a history of good judgment and says that was against the Iraq War despite Clinton’s claims. Trump says the Iraq War was a “disaster” and how Obama pulled out of Iraq was also a disaster.\n8:30: Trump now on stage with Lauer. He gets a warm applause that Clinton did not receive.\n8:25: Clinton says she will do everything in her power to make sure people will be safer in Boston and San Bernardino after her presidency. She talks about taking on ISIS in the “arena of ideas” and engage them in the air, on the ground, and in cyberspace. She now uses the opportunity to push gun control by saying people on the terrorist watch list should not be able to buy guns without going over what happens if someone is mistakenly put on that list. She uses the time to attack Trump on her Muslim ban. Lauer never reminds voters that she vowed not to attack Trump at the beginning of the forum.\n8:23: Questioner asks Clinton how she will determine whether American troops should be sent into combat missions. She says we will not put ground troops into Iraq and Syria and will defeat ISIS without ground troops in the region. She says there were 200,000 troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan when she was Secretary of State and is glad we have brought “most of those” home.\n8:21: When asked about the high rates of suicide among veterans, Clinton says she has put forth a “robust agenda” to prevent veterans from committing suicide.\n8:19: An undecided Sergeant asks Clinton about the VA scandal her comments that it was not “widespread.” Clinton uses the opportunity to say that she will not let the VA become privatized. She says that will be “disastrous for our military veterans.” She says she will have a meeting every week in the Oval Office re: VA issues.\n8:17: Lauer asks Clinton what would happen if Iran cheats on the nuclear deal. Clinton says she wants to put it into context because it is one of the most important strategic questions we face. She claims Iran was on a “fast track” to get nuclear weapons when she became Secretary of State. She gets testy when Lauer tries to get her off of her talking points and claims the Iran deal put a “lid” on the nuclear program. Clinton says Iran is not playing us on the nuclear deal in response to Lauer’s question.\n8:15: Clinton claims she views force as a “last resort” when a progressive questioner asks her about her “hawkish” foreign policy. Also keeps claiming we didn’t lose a single American life in Libya.\nClinton defended her support for 2011 Libya intervention. Most people have no idea what happened in Libya. So she can re-define it.\n— Marshall Cohen (@Marshall_Cohen) September 8, 2016\n#Hillary backs away from Libya very quickly but here's how gung-ho she was #NBCNewsForum: pic.twitter.com/DXOk5VEsAB\n— Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) September 8, 2016\nClinton again says “we did not lose a single American” in Libya intervention. Not sure why she keeps saying this.\n— Blake Hounshell (@blakehounshell) September 8, 2016\nReally? @HillaryClinton said we ""didn't lose a single American in Libya"". She does know #Benghazi is in Libya right? #NBCNewsForum\n— Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) September 8, 2016\n8:11: Clinton now asked about her Iraq vote. She says the decision to go to war in Iraq was a “mistake.” She says she also believes that it is “imperative that we learn from the mistakes” like after-action reports are supposed to do. She says we must learn what led us down that path so that it never happens again and claims she is in the best position to do that. Clinton claims Trump was for the war in Iraq after promising Lauer she wouldn’t use the time to attack Trump. She says Trump refuses to take responsibility for his support. [Lauer doesn’t call Clinton out. Will he call Trump out if he uses some of his time to attack Clinton?]\n[Clinton sounds like a bureaucrat instead of a leader.]\n8:09: Questioner asks how he could have confidence in her when she compromised national security. Clinton robotically tries to explain that “classified material is designated” and marked so that “there is no dispute at all” that what is being communicated is classified. She says “what we have here is the use of an unclassified system by hundreds of people” in out government to send information with no markings. She claims she communicated about classified materials on a separate system. She also says she went into tents on foreign travel to view classified information and took it “very seriously.” She claims she did exactly what she should have done re: handling classified information.\n8:08: Clinton claims there is no evidence that hostile actors hacked into her email account despite FBI Director Comey’s insistence that her private email server was vulnerable to hacking.\n8:05: Lauer asks Clinton about her email scandal. He asks her why her email scandal is not “disqualifying.” Clinton robotically repeats that it was a “mistake” to have a personal account. She says the real question is the handling of classified material. She says she has a lot of experience dealing with classified materials. She says classified materials have headers that say “secret” or “top secret” or “confidential.” She claims that “none of the emails sent or received by me” had such a header. But she admits there were emails involving America’s “covert drone program.”\n[Clinton not even winning over her friends in the mainstream press.]\nClinton on private server: “I make no excuses for it” // except she DID make excuses\n— Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) September 8, 2016\nOh, no, back to ""headers."" It's like Gore's ""no controlling legal authority."" Too much parsing.\n— Roger Simon (@politicoroger) September 8, 2016\n8:00: Hillary Clinton on stage with Lauer as the forum kicks off. Lauer asks Clinton not to use the forum to attack Trump and says he’ll ask Trump to do the same. When asked what is the most important characteristic a commander-in-chief can possess, Clinton answers “steadiness.” She says a Commander-in-Chief must listen and be able to sort out the different options being presented. Clinton keeps talking about “judgment” and “temperament.”\n7:30: Chelsea Clinton accuses Trump of making “misogynistic” remarks about her mom.\n7:11: On MSNBC, Andrea Mitchell again cheerleads for Clinton, claiming that she has proven that she could answer the 3 AM phone call despite the Benghazi debacle.\n7:05: Mainstream media pundits who spent a year lowering the bar for Trump are now complaining that Trump has a lower bar to jump over tonight than Clinton.\n7:00: Some pre-game reading. Joel Pollak on the five things Lauer probably will not ask Clinton.\n6:55: Even the nasty left-wing Esquire columnist Charles Pierce is worried that, “Politically, I think it is entirely possible that the event may be a net plus for Donald Trump.”\n6:45: Trump (he has plenty of stamina to be at a campaign event before his first showdown with Clinton): Hillary not a “real” New Yorker:\n""Hillary, she's not a New Yorker,"" Trump tells NY Conservative Party. ""I'm a real New Yorker.""\n— Candace Smith (@CandaceSmith_) September 7, 2016\nTrump's full quote when he said Clinton's not a New Yorker: pic.twitter.com/jargWU4rYv\n— Ashley Killough (@KilloughCNN) September 7, 2016\n6:40: Very interesting. The New York Times asks readers, “Have You Done Something to Support or Oppose Trump’s Brands?”:\nDonald J. Trump’s presidential campaign has elicited strong emotions.

She claims that Trump believes Obama is not a true American even though her campaign was the one that amplified the birther accusations against Obama.\n7:08: Clinton talks about “translating love into action.” She says she will ban the box and combat systemic racism. After blasting Trump for his comments about unemployment in African-American communities, she admits that youth unemployment for African-American youth is twice as high as that of white Americans.\n7:00: In Kansas City, Clinton says that people who look at the African-American community and only see “poverty, crime, and despair are missing so much.” She speaks about having taught Sunday school and that we are commanded to love. She says that’s a tough commandment to obey. “Sometimes, it’s really hard for me,” she says.\nShe also speaks about the epidemic of gun violence “ravaging” our communities and pushes gun buyback programs and more gun control.\n6:30: Never Trump candidate fails to qualify for Wyoming ballot.\n6:20:\nWheels down Kansas City.

He says this has to be a “shared national mission” to bring hope to every child. He vows to use the pulpit of the presidency to campaign for more school choice.\n2:43: Quinnipiac state polls:\nQuinnipiac: Clinton+5 in PA, Clinton+4 in NC, Tie in Fl, Trump+4 in Ohio in the four way https://t.co/iOBL6OXne8\n— Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) September 8, 2016\n2:40: Trump says it’s time to “rebuild America” and “take out ISIS.” He says Clinton is clueless about job creation. And he says that too many in the inner cities have not been included in the American Dream. He says his goal as president will be to ensure that every child be placed on the ladder to success. He says the ladder rests on a fundamental foundation–“we need safety. There’s such danger in our inner cities.” Trump says every kid must be able to grow up in a safe community because “you can’t have prosperity without security.” He is also blasting the government-run education bureaucracy that is protecting high-paid bureaucrats. Trump says he wants every child in the inner cities to attend the school of their choice. Trump says it’s a matter of putting “students first” and not the “education bureaucracy.”\n2:32: Trump says Clinton believes in “globalism” and “not Americanism.” He blasts Clinton for saying no American died in Libya and says the biggest difference in the race is Iraq–Clinton supported it while he opposed it. Trump also points out that Clinton used her time in the State Department to give up much of the country’s uranium to Russia, do favors for UBS bank and give contracts to friends and family in Haiti.\n2:30: Trump is slamming Clinton for endangering the country’s national security with her private server. He points out that the FBI discovered that foreign agents hacked into the accounts of those with whom she regularly communicated. Trump says this is why Clinton is “unfit” to become president. He also says Clinton failed to take responsibility for her Middle East policy that has unleashed radical Islam terrorists across the world.\n2:20: Pence is asked what is the biggest misconception about Donald Trump.

Someone is finally listening to American and legal immigrant families!”\n1:56: Pence says when Trump sees huge crowds, he tells him, “this is a movement. And it’s bigger than us.” He says Trump is running against one of the “most dishonest candidates ever.” He says the American people picked a bold truth teller in 1980″ and they will elect a bold truth teller in 2016.\n.@realDonaldTrump will nominate justices to the Supreme Court in the mold of the late Justice Antonin Scalia\n— Mike Pence (@mike_pence) September 8, 2016\nThere are more than 7 million Americans living in poverty today than when @BarackObama took office\n— Mike Pence (@mike_pence) September 8, 2016\n1:52: Pence says Trump and Reagan have different styles but there are fundamental similarities. They are honest, tough, and believe in the what has always made America strong, he says. Pence says Reagan’s bluntness ushered in a GOP landslide because “he meant it. And so does Donald Trump.” He compares Reagan Democrats to “Trumpocrats.” Pence says Trump has the “toughness to rebuild our economy and command the respect of the world.”\n1:48: Pence reminds the audience that Reagan wanted to be President in 1976 so he could meet with the Soviet leader and ask him what it would take for America to get along with the Soviets… and then whisper in his ear, “Nyet!”\n1:47: Pence points out that the “smart set” dismissed Reagan as a “simpleton” and an “entertainer who entered politics late in life.” He says union members and working-class Democrats leaned in and listened to Reagan’s eloquence and the common sense of the uncommonly talented man. He says Ronald Reagan spoke the truth to the American people just like Donald Trump has.\n[Trump is no Reagan, but the same types of people on both sides of the aisle who initially hated Reagan are the same types who dislike Trump.]\n1:45: Pence says he always say Reagan as a “solutions conservative.” He says Reagan’s principles still work when you put them into practice. Pence says “it’s exactly the kind of leadership Donald Trump is going to bring to Washington, D.C. when he is elected president.”\n1:42: Another campaign theme that would be much more productive than “I’m so flattered that Putin may have called me brilliant.”\nMy father has created REAL jobs.

Pence remembers telling his wife that Reagan was the reason he became a Republican. He shook Reagan’s hand and felt like he was talking to Mount Rushmore. Pence thanked Reagan for inspiring his generation to believe in his country again and Pence believes that Reagan blushed and said, “well, Mike, that’s a nice thing to say.”\n1:35: She seems to concede that the public perceives her as a “cold” and “unemotional” person who lacks empathy.\n""I don’t view myself as cold or unemotional.""

All Trump needed to say was that nice comments from foreign leaders will in no way influence any of his decisions. The less Trump speaks (like someone who is just winging it, Trump often seems like he has to fill up time when it may be best to just give short, succinct answers and not talk as much) the better it may be for him in the debates. Clinton keeps turning the ball over to Trump. Imagine if Trump would stop throwing it back to her on the next play.\nHillary Clinton repudiates Trump's praise for Putin as ""unpatriotic, insulting, scary, and dangerous"" https://t.co/MgO0GgUQcA\n— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 8, 2016\n1:10: “Sources” slamming Lauer as a “disaster” would only happen if Clinton performed poorly.

She says she has a “special plan” for Historically black colleges and universities. She says voting rights are “under attack” in North Carolina.

"CANONSBURG, Pa. — Donald Trump Jr. defended Pennsylvania’s coal industry from former President Bill Clinton in a Wednesday appearance in southwestern Pennsylvania.\nIn an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, the son of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump praised energy production jobs, which have kept the state afloat since the country’s late-2000s recession, as important to national security as well as economic growth.\nTrump lit into Bill Clinton’s recent comments mocking coal workers. The former president called them “coal people,” said they believe global warming is a “Chinese hoax,” and taunted their work as outdated and obsolete. Breitbart News’ Charlie Spiering reported on Clinton’s remarks at a Pennsylvania rally last week:\nHe argued that coal workers should realize that the industry was dying and that it was time to focus on solar panels and windmills.\n“Coal employment peaked in 1920, coal production peaked in 1950,” he said, adding, “Climate change is real and we’re going to have to change our energy source.”\nTrump defended the relevance of coal workers: “When we talk about ‘electric cars,’ hey guys, they’re coal-powered cars,” he said.\n“If there’s been a boom in Pennsylvania, it’s because of natural gas. Your Democratic governor wants to take credit for that, but guess what? Hillary Clinton wants to shut those things down. She wants to be beholden to Saudi Arabia, who writes her $25 million checks.”\nTrump continued this line of attack, arguing that preserving the U.S. energy industry is a “national security” issue.\n“That’s not just common sense, it’s not just energy independence, it’s not just jobs and tax base, it’s national security,” he said. “To be able to take care of ourselves and make sure we’re utilizing the resources that we’ve been blessed to have — I mean, we’re the natural gas capital of the world. And yet, she’d want to shut that down so that we can write checks to countries that hate our guts and hate our values and hate everything about us. That’s not gonna happen on our watch.”\nAsked about his father’s chances of winning Pennsylvania — which has not gone to a Republican presidential candidate since 1988 — Trump touted local efforts like the Southpointe office celebrating its grand opening on Wednesday. He said a strong get-out-the-vote effort would come from “people on the ground speaking to the union voters. Yes, the union bosses, they’ve been bought and paid for by the DNC for generations. But the actual workers, the working-class men and women of this country, those are the people who are going to break party lines.\n“They’re gonna come and vote for Trump, because, you know what? They want to see common sense infused back into politics, back into government. They’re sick of seeing everyone around DC and all the zip codes around DC being the richest in the country while they suffer.”\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

Trump says maybe he’ll bring it up at the next debate. Trump says Clinton doesn’t have what it takes to make America great again. Trump says he thinks the debate went “better” than he thought.\n10:58: John Hayward spot-on: Trump had golden opportunity to potentially win the election tonight.

Dana Bash on CNN is now grilling Trump about accusing Clinton’s former campaign manager for ginning up birtherism. Trump says he was proud to have gotten Obama to release his birth certificate and Clinton failed. He says he is “proud” that he got Obama to release his birth certificate.\n10:52: Trump could have won the election tonight. He didn’t. Huge opportunity lost. But he didn’t lose it either.

Trump says he wants to make America Great Again and if Clinton wins, he will “absolutely support her.”\nLove Lester, but how is Trump questioned about his baggage (tax returns, birther, etc) but Clinton gets nothing about emails, Libya, etc?\n— Bill Melugin (@BillFOX46) September 27, 2016\n10:32: Trump says we “cannot be the policemen of the world” and defend countries all over the world. Trump says Clinton doesn’t have the stamina to be president of this country. He says you also have to be able to negotiate good trade deals. After Clinton says Trump can talk to her about stamina after he travels to 128 countries, Trump says Clinton’s experience is “bad experience” and the country can’t afford four more years of “bad experience.” After Holt sets up Clinton by asking Trump about his comments about looks, Clinton now accuses Trump of calling a woman in beauty contest “Miss Piggy” and “Miss Housekeeper” because she was Latina. Clinton says that Latina is an American citizen who will be voting against Trump. [Clinton gets her soundbite for Hispanic media in.]\n10:30: Clinton now speaking about standing up to bullies “abroad and at home.”\n10:29: WTF?\nNotice Trump sniffing all the time. Coke user?\n— Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) September 27, 2016\n10:24: Clinton defends the Iran Deal, says she got a deal “without firing a single shot.” Clinton says Trump doesn’t have the “judgment” or “temperament” to be Commander-in-Chief. She is now attacking Trump for his comments re: proliferation of nuclear weapons. Trump answers, “wrong.” Clinton says Trump’s “cavalier attitude” about nuclear weapons is “so troubling.” Trump says Clinton has been “cavalier” re: Russia and nuclear weapons.\n10:22: Trump says he has a better “temperament” than Clinton and says his strongest asset is his “temperament.” He says he has a “winning temperament.”\nClinton: I've been practicing this ""Whoo! OK"" for weeks, and damn it I'm going to use it.\n— Jonathan Bernstein (@jbview) September 27, 2016\n10:21: A potentially record audience is watching this debate, and Trump has FAILED to put Clinton on the defensive re: Clinton Foundation and how her use of a private email server endangered America’s national security.\n10:19: Trump says “that is a mainstream media nonsense” when Holt says he supported the Iraq War. Trump says Clinton’s top ally is the mainstream press. Trump now defending his opposition to the Iraq War.\n10:17: Trump says Clinton started to Iran Deal, which he says is “another beauty.” Trump says he has common sense and talks about his suggestion that NATO nations need to pay their fair share. Trump now accuses Obama/Clinton of creating a vacuum that allowed ISIS to grow.\n10:16:\nFYI, there are sitting Members of Congress on the ""no fly"" list #debates\n— Gov. Gary Johnson (@GovGaryJohnson) September 27, 2016\n10:15: Clinton says we have to have an “intelligence surge” to prevent homegrown terrorist attacks. Clinton hammers Trump for insulting Muslims because they have to be on the front lines to help law enforcement.\n10:14: Clinton says she hopes the fact-checkers are “turned up” and “turning up the volume” and says Trump supported the Iraq War. “Wrong,” responds Trump.\n10:13: Trump is failing to successfully pivot and attack Clinton on her foundation, email scandals, Benghazi, etc. These are things voters who are tuning into the election for the first time need to hear. He talks about the the hackers could be people weighing 400 lbs. sitting their bedrooms. [Lack of preparation and poor game-planning.]\n10:09: Trump says he was endorsed by admirals and ICE. He says the Border Patrol agents endorsed him as well. He says he will take the admirals and the generals over the political hacks. Trump says ISIS is beating us at our own game while Clinton is talking about how we can do more with tech companies to prevent ISIS from making gains.\n[Trump should have pointed out that Clinton’s use of a private email server endangered the country’s national security.]\n10:06: Lester Holt asks Clinton about cybersecurity WITHOUT mentioning that Clinton’s use of a private server put our country’s national security at risk. Clinton says Putin is playing a “long game” by hacking into the personal files of government officials. She says she was “so shocked when” Trump asked Putin to “hack into Americans.”\n10:05: Spot-on point:\nEvery @LesterHoltNBC question is a setup for @HillaryClinton to attack @realDonaldTrump. Exactly as the left & media demanded. #debatenight\n— Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) September 27, 2016\n10:04: Trump says Clinton treated Obama with terrible “disrespect” during the debates. Trump says “when you try to act holier than thou, it really doesn’t work.” Trump says he settled the lawsuit with the Justice Department with “zero admission of guilt.” Trump talks about integrating his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach.\n10:02: Clinton says Trump tried to put the birther/racist “lie” to bed. Clinton accuse Trump of “starting his political activity” based on this “racist lie that our first Black President was not an American citizen.” Clinton brings up that the Justice Department sued Trump twice for discriminating against prospective tenants. She says the “birther lie” was a “hurtful one” because Obama is a man of dignity. She says it bothered Obama and quotes Michelle Obama, who said, “when they go low, we go high. And Barack Obama went high despite Donald Trump’s best efforts to bring him down.”\n10:01: Trump says he thinks he has developed very good relations with the “African-American community” and he says he thinks he has done a great job/service for the country/and the president to get him to release his birth certificate.\n9:59: Holt brings up the birther controversy. Trump says Clinton confidante Sidney Blumenthal and former campaign manager Patty Solis Doyle failed to get Obama’s birth certificate. He says he succeeded in getting the birth certificate and he wants to get on with fighting ISIS and securing the border. Holt says the birth certificate was presented in 2012 and he continued to express doubts. Trump is blaming Clinton’s allies for starting the controversy.\n9:58: Trump says the African-American community has been let down by politicians who “abuse and use” them to get votes. Trump says he’s been all over while, looking at Clinton, “you decided to stay home. And that’s okay.” Clinton says she thinks Trump criticized her for preparing for this debate. She says she also has prepared to be president, and that’s a good thing.\n9:57: Trump’s Twitter ad:\nWhat is Hillary's Worst Lie? Vote Now! https://t.co/vb1K34lAI8\n— Donald J.

Called the whole country racist. #debatenight\n— Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) September 27, 2016\n9:55: Trump says we have to “look strongly” at no-fly lists and watch lists re: gun control. He doesn’t mention that Americans can easily lose their Second Amendment rights due to bureaucratic errors. [Again, another example of Trump not being able to finesse a complex issue. Shows lack of preparation re: basic questions.] Trump defends stop and frisk after slamming Clinton for calling black criminals “super predators.”\n9:54: When asked about implicit biases against black people, Clinton says implicit bias is a problem not just for police but for everyone. She says everyone needs to ask hard questions about “why am I feeling this way?”\n9:47: Clinton now pushing gun control. She says police are often outgunned by people with “militaristic” weapons.\n9:45: Trump says we need “law and order” or we’re not going to have a country. He says “we have a situation” where African-AMericans and Hispanics in our inner cities are “living in hell” because “it’s so dangerous.” He mentions the thousands of shootings in Chicago and says “we have to stop the violence” and “bring back law and order” in a place like Chicago. Trump now talks about illegal immigrant gang members roaming the streets and says we have to be “very vigilant.” He says our police are afraid to do anything right now and “we have to protect our inner cities” because “African-American communities are being decimated by crime.” Holt says stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York because it was a form of racial profiling. Clinton points out that stop and frisk was found to be “unconstitutional.” Clinton talking about mandatory minimums and ending the privatization of the prison system. Clinton says she believes strongly that “commonsense gun measures should assist us.”\n[Trump should have better answers and pivots to these very predictable questions.]\n9:43: Debate turns to race relations. Holt says “one of you will have to bridge” a bitter divide. Clinton says race determines where people live and what kind of education people get and how they are treated in the criminal justice system. Clinton says “we’ve got to do several things at the same time.” She says we have to “restore trust between communities and police” and police are well-prepared to use force only when necessary.\n9:41: Trump says “it’s all words and soundbites.” Trump, now defending the bankruptcy filings, says he used certain laws four times. He says he has taken advantage of the laws of the nation and his obligation is to do well for himself, his family, his employees, his companies.\n9:40: Clinton says she has met tons of small business folks who were stiffed by Trump. When Clinton says thousands of people were stiffed, Trump says “maybe they didn’t do a good job.” Clinton says she is relieved that her late father never did business with Trump. Clinton says sometimes there is not a “direct transfer of skills from business to government.”\n9:36: Clinton says she made a “mistake” using a private email server. She says she is “not going to make any excuses.” Trump says “that was more than a mistake.” He accuses Clinton of “purposefully” setting up a private email server. Trump says “you don’t learn that much from tax returns” and says her use of a private email server was “disgraceful.” Trump now claims he is severely “under-leveraged.” Trump now pivoting to infrastructure, saying our country’s infrastructure is like a “third-world country” while spending trillions of dollars in the Middle East. He blames “politicians like Secretary Clinton” for causing these problems. Trump says we don’t have the money to rebuild our country because politicians like Clinton have squandered the country’s money. Clinton accuses Trump of not paying income taxes and not contributing to the treasury.\n9:33: Trump says he will release his tax returns against his lawyers’s wishes as soon as Clinton releases here 33,000 deleted emails. Some cheers in the audience. Holt admonishes the audience. Clinton says you’ve seen another example of “bait and switch here.” She says everyone running for president has released tax returns. “You gotta ask yourself–why won’t he release his tax returns? she says. Clinton says maybe Trump is not as rich as he says he is. She says maybe Trump is not as charitable as he says he is. Clinton says maybe he doesn’t want the American people to know that he has paid nothing in federal taxes. She also suggests Trump may owe money to Wall Street and foreign entities. Clinton trying to provoke Trump. She says “it must be something important” or “terrible” that Trump is trying to hide.\n[Holt doesn’t bring up Clinton’s emails. Trump had to do that.]\n9:32: Holt asks Trump about his tax returns. Trump says he doesn’t mind releasing his tax returns but he is under a “routine audit” and he will release his return once the audit is complete.\n9:31: Trump says Yellin and the Fed are doing “political things.” He says the Fed will raise interest rates and “very bad things will happen” and the Fed is “being more political than Secretary Clinton.”\n9:30: [To use a football analogy, not an offensive showdown here. This is like two teams getting to the 40-yard line and punting, which is what often happens in low-scoring first halves of Super Bowls.]\n9:29: Clinton seems to be getting under Trump’s skin a bit by talking about the “Trump loophole” and “trumped-up trickle-down economics.”\n9:24: When Clinton falsely claims she will also cut a lot of regulations, Trump shakes his head. [Good visual for Trump.] Trump says Clinton will raise $1.3 trillion worth of taxes. Trump ridicules Clinton for having a plan to fight ISIS on her website and Clinton says “at least I have a plan.” Trump says Clinton has been fighting ISIS for her entire adult life because she telegraphs her plans to the enemy. Clinton says she has a feeling that she will be blamed for everything that has gone wrong. Trump says “why not?” Clinton mocks Trump for saying “crazy things” and Trump says it’s not crazy to talk about his plans for repatriation.\n9:23: Trump says Clinton will tax and regulate businesses out of existence. Trump says when he travels around the country, people like that he has proposed to cut unnecessary regulations. He says he is going to “cut taxes big league” and “you’re going to raise taxes big league. End of story.”\nClinton promotes the home page of her website as a real-time fact-checking site. Trump asks voters to take a look at his home page as well.\n9:21: Trump says Clinton was “totally in favor” of the TPP and only changed her position when Trump’s opposition to the trade deal was resonating. Clinton, sounding lawyerly says she was against it once the terms were negotiated. Clinton says, “Donald, I know you live in your own reality” but those are not the facts. “Secretary, you have no plan,” Trump says. Clinton says she has a book of plans and says you can pick one up at the airport. She says “we have a very robust set of plans.” [Clinton sounding like the know-it-all student who always sits at the front of the class and brings the teacher an apple.]\n9:19: When Clinton says her husband did a great job, Trump says he approved NAFTA, which is one of the worst deals ever. Trump’s first “excuse me” of the night when he corrects Clinton, who is on the defensive over trade deals.\nFlip-Flop @HillaryClinton Has Demonstrated Her Position On Trade Is Purely Political #Debates https://t.co/PdOO9dqLJ8\n— Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) September 27, 2016\n9:17: Clinton accuses Trump of believing that the Chinese created the climate change hoax. Trump interrupts and says that’s not true. Trump seems to bring up Solyndra as an example of the Dems’s failed green energy policy. Trump says Clinton cannot do what she is proposing to do when the country is $20 trillion in debt. Trump says we have to give companies better incentives to grow at home. He says you only have to look at Ohio and Michigan to see where all of the factories have left. Trump asks Clinton why she has just been proposing solutions on trade now when she has been in this for 30 years. Trump says he can bring back jobs and she can’t.\n9:13: Trump must be in this to win it. He does NOT take the bait that Clinton threw out about his father having loaned him $14 million and re-litigate the matter endlessly.\n9:12: Trump says we don’t know what we’re doing re: devaluation. He says we have to renegotiate our trade deals. Trump asks why hasn’t Clinton made trade deals better? He says Secretary Clinton should have been opposed to these trade deals years ago. Trump says we owe $20 trillion and “we can’t do it any longer.”\n[Clinton is vulnerable on this issue because of her support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.]\n.@realDonaldTrump on calling @HillaryClinton ""Secretary Clinton"": ""Is that okay?…I want you to be very happy."" https://t.co/6iC87pjJWd\n— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 27, 2016\n9:11: Clinton accuses Trump of supporting “trickle-down” economics. She says Trump was “very fortunate” in his life with “$14 million” borrowed from his father. She accuses Trump of believing that the more you help wealthy people, the better the country will be. [Clinton is baiting Trump with the $14 million figure. Will Trump bite?]\n9:08: Trump says “our jobs are fleeing this country” and going to China and Mexico. He says they are using “our country as a piggybank” to rebuild China. He says while Mexico is the “eighth wonder of the world” by building so many factories, America is not building new factories. He says “Hillary and I” agree on child care though they may disagree on numbers. He says we have to stop jobs being “stolen from us” and companies like Carrier from leaving the United States. He says that under his plan, he will be “reducing taxes tremendously” for small and big business. “That will be a job creator like we haven’t seen since Ronald Reagan,” Trump says. He says we must renegotiate our trade deals and stop these companies from stealing our companies and jobs.\n[Very good opening from Trump.]\n9:06: Clinton says today is her granddaughter’s second birthday and talks about “investing in you.” She talks about jobs and infrastructure in addition to clean energy and small businesses. She says “we have to make the economy fairer” and talks about raising the minimum wage, pay equity, and profit sharing.\nShe wants the “wealthy to pay their fair share” and more corporate taxes.\n9:05: Holt says central to the “Achieving Prosperity” section of the debate is jobs.

"FARMVILLE, Virginia — Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the GOP’s vice presidential nominee, dominated his Democratic counterpart Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) in the only debate between the two before the election at Longwood University.\n“Gov. Pence was flawless,” Jason Miller, the senior communications adviser to Pence’s running mate Donald J. Trump, told Breitbart News. “Tonight showed the strength of the Trump-Pence ticket and that our ideas are better for America. And ultimately, it showed the good judgment Donald Trump has in selecting such a strong number two in Gov. Pence.”\nPence’s win came on a night where the Democratic presidential ticket of Hillary Rodham Clinton and Kaine were set back significantly after a smooth past week since the first of three Trump-Clinton debates at Hofstra University last Monday. Trump, under fire from Clinton and her allies in the legacy establishment media since the last debate, has clawed his way back from the brink yet again with a series of successful rallies during the weekend, culminating with a major pair of appearances in Colorado on Monday evening. But it was Pence’s performance at the vice presidential debate, moderated by CBS News’ Elaine Quijano, that has put new spring in the Trump camp’s step heading into the next all-important debate on Sunday evening in St. Louis.\nPence took command of the stage from the outset. After both Kaine and Pence gave satisfactory answers to a fundamental question about readiness for the presidential job should that need ever arise, the first real question of the debate to Kaine from Quijano set the tone off the bat.\n“Senator Kaine, on the campaign trail, you praised Secretary Clinton’s character, including her commitment to public service, yet 60 percent of voters don’t think she’s trustworthy. Why do so many people distrust her? Is it because they have questions about her emails and the Clinton Foundation?” Quijano asked Kaine.\nIn his answer, Kaine refused to defend Clinton at all on the Clinton Foundation—the source of controversy for perhaps the Clinton political dynasty’s biggest scandals, the Clinton Cash narrative—and wouldn’t defend her use of a private email server either.\nInstead, when trying to explain why he trusts Clinton when so many Americans do not, he quickly pivoted the answer into an attack on Donald Trump instead—without giving any substantial evidence for why anyone should trust his running mate. When Pence got a similar question as a follow-up, he seized the moment to frame Kaine and Clinton as simply hurlers of insults running a policy-free campaign.\n“Let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult-driven campaign,” Pence said, calmly and coolly, directly challenging Kaine. “It really is remarkable.”\nAs Pence proceeded to detail the many failures of Hillary Clinton’s time in government, Kaine interrupted him many times with what seemed to be petty interjections. All told, all evening, Kaine would interrupt Pence or the moderator Quijano scores of times—70 in some counts.\nAs Kaine unsuccessfully attempted to steal the momentum from Pence, the Indiana Governor joked playfully, “I must have hit a nerve here.” Kaine would spend the next minute or so continually trying to talk over Pence and failing, as Quijano eventually cut him off and told him he would eventually get a chance to respond.\nAt one point in this early exchange, in one of his many interruptions, Kaine declared it was his turn to talk. “Okay, now I can weigh in,” Kaine said, before Quijano held him back again: “Senator, you have an opportunity to respond.”\nWhen he finally got a word in, Kaine claimed all was rosy on planet earth—claiming the status quo as his and Clinton’s campaign mantlepiece.\n“Governor Pence — Governor Pence doesn’t think the world’s going so well, and he, you know, is going to say it’s everybody’s fault,” Kaine implored, to which Pence simply retorted, “Do you?”\nKaine then tried to take credit—on Clinton’s behalf—for killing Osama bin Laden, the 9/11 mastermind and al-Qaeda leader, even though she was not responsible for taking down bin Laden.\n“Let me tell you this: When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Governor Pence, did you know that Osama bin Laden was alive?” Kaine said.\n“Yes,” Pence replied.\nAfter that rocky start, Kaine never recovered—and Pence toyed with him all night while speaking directly into the cameras for the millions at home watching to hear his policy-focused agenda.\nWhen the conversation turned to the economy, Pence delivered perhaps his best lines of the night—where he clearly laid out the success of his conservative economic policies as Indiana’s governor while subtly, but pointedly, undermining Kaine’s weaknesses from his time as Virginia’s governor.\n“I think the fact that — that under this past administration of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we’ve almost doubled the national debt is atrocious,” Pence said. He added:\nI mean, I’m very proud of the fact that — I come from a state that works. The state of Indiana has balanced budgets. We cut taxes, we’ve made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank. That’s a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia. He actually — he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion. He left his state about $2 billion in the hole. In the state of Indiana, we’ve cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor.\nBut I think he’s a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same. It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that. You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful. But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare. They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start.\nLook, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy. We can get America moving again. Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that’ll put the American worker first, and you’ve got a prescription for real growth. And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that’s when you can deal with the national debt. When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth, which Donald Trump’s plan will do, then we’re going to have the resources to meet our nation’s needs at home and abroad, and we’re going to have the ability to bring down the national debt.\nIn his answer, Kaine started with a canned catch line that did not go over well.\n“On the economy, there’s a fundamental choice for the American electorate,” Kaine said. “Do you want a ‘you’re hired’ president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a ‘you’re fired’ president in Donald Trump? I think that’s not such a hard choice.”\nFrom there, Kaine struggled to detail his and Clinton’s economic plans—then admitted that there’s tax hikes in them—before spending the rest of, and the majority of in total, his answer attacking Trump, rather than telling the audience about their own plans.\nWhenever Kaine or Quijano tried to shift the conversation back to Trump’s tax returns, as they often did throughout the night, Pence handled them with ease.\n“Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine. And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine — God bless you for it, career public servants, that’s great — Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician. He actually built a business,” Pence said when Quijano pressed him on the matter for the second time, specifically about Trump’s illegally obtained tax documents from 1995 that The New York Times had published during the weekend.\n“Those tax returns that … came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago. But like virtually every other business, including The New York Times not too long ago, he used what’s called net operating loss. We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country.”\nAfter more back and forth on the taxes—during which Pence swatted away attack after attack— and a brief exchange on Social Security, Quijano moved the conversation to the issue of community-police relations. Pence hit another home run.\n“You know, my uncle was a cop, a career cop, on the beat in downtown Chicago. He was my hero when I was growing up. And we’d go up to visit my dad’s family in Chicago. My three brothers and I would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform, sidearm at his side,” he said, before broadly defending police officers:\nPolice officers are the best of us. And the men and women, white, African American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day. And let me say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea. It’s worked in the Hoosier state. And we fully support that.\nDonald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation. It’s probably — probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next President of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them. They see his commitment to law and order.\nBut they also — they also hear the bad-mouthing, the bad-mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as — as a reason to — to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of — of implicit bias or institutional racism. And that really has got to stop.\nI mean, when an African American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith — Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy. I mean, I — we — we mourn with those who mourn. We — we grieve with those who grieve. And we’re saddened at the loss of life.\nBut Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where — where she used — when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there’s implicit bias in everyone in the United States.\nNext up was immigration, and it was here where Pence delivered the best line of the night—but first Pence, in depth, detailed exactly what Donald Trump’s immigration plan is:\nDonald Trump’s laid out a plan to end illegal immigration once and for all in this country. We’ve been talking it to death for 20 years. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to continue the policies of open borders, amnesty, catch and release, sanctuary cities, all the things that are driving — that are driving wages down in this country, Senator, and also too often with criminal aliens in the country, it’s bringing heartbreak.\nBut I — Donald Trump has a plan that he laid out in Arizona, that will deal systemically with illegal immigration, beginning with border security, internal enforcement. It’s probably why for the first time in the history of Immigration and Customs Enforcement their union actually endorsed Donald Trump as the next President of the United States because they know they need help to enforce the laws of this country.\nAnd Donald Trump has laid out a priority to remove criminal aliens, remove people that have overstayed their visas. And — and once we have accomplished all of that, which will — which will strengthen our economy, strengthen the rule of law in the country and make our communities safer once the criminal aliens are out, then we’ll deal with those that remain.\nBut I have to tell you, I just — I was listening to the avalanche of insults coming out of Senator Kaine a minute ago.\nKaine, attempting again to interrupt Pence, was stopped by the Indiana Governor who reminded him it was his time to speak. Quijano confirmed Pence still had the floor, and then Kaine apologized for interrupting yet again.\n“I apologize. It’s your two minutes. I apologize,” Kaine said.\n“Thanks. I forgive you,” Pence replied.\nThat’s when Pence, sensing a Kaine weakened from overextending throughout the debate to this point, stuck the knife in his opponent.\n“He says ours is an insult-driven campaign. Did you all just hear that? Ours is an insult-driven campaign?” Pence said, adding:\nI mean, to be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all of the things that you’ve said he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn’t have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables. It’s — she said they were irredeemable. They were not American. I mean, it’s extraordinary. And then she labeled one after another “ism” on millions of Americans who believe that we can have a stronger America at home and abroad, who believe we can get this economy moving again, who believe that we can end illegal immigration once and for all. So, Senator, this — this insult-driven campaign, I mean that’s small potatoes compared to Hillary Clinton, calling half of Donald Trump’s supporters a basket of deplorables.\nKaine, in his rebuttal, falsely claimed that Clinton retracted and apologized for calling Trump supporters “deplorables.”\n“Hillary Clinton said something on the campaign trail, and the very next day, she said, you know what: I shouldn’t have said that,” Kaine claimed.\nPence quickly corrected him: “He said she shouldn’t have said half.”\nThen, after Kaine commenced rattling off a series of progressive complaints with Trump, the Virginia Senator shifted the conversation back to immigration by attacking Trump’s reform plan.\n“Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents,” Kaine said. He continued:\nAnd both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship. So if you’re born here, but your parents don’t have documents, they want to eliminate that. That’s another 4.5 million people. These guys — and Donald Trump have said it — deportation force. They want to go house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people.\n“That’s nonsense. That’s nonsense,” Pence corrected Kaine again.\n“I cannot believe that Governor Pence would sit here and defend his running mate’s claim that we should create a deportation force to — so that they’ll all be gone,” Kaine trudged on.\n“Senator, we have a deportation force. It’s called Immigrations and Customs Enforcement,” Pence explained to Kaine. “And the union for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for the first time in their history endorsed Donald Trump to be the next President of the United States of America.”\nAfter Pence further explained Trump’s common sense immigration reform plan, he delivered yet another zinger against Kaine.\n“Senator, I’ll work with you when you go back to the Senate, I promise you. We’ll work with you to reform the immigration system,” Pence told Kaine, an implicit dig at him since the only way he goes back to the Senate is if he and Clinton lose in November.\nKaine was clunky in his reply again, playing into Pence’s game once more. “I look forward to working together in whatever capacities we serve in,” Kaine said.\nLater, on cybersecurity, Pence landed the jab on Kaine again. “I look forward if I’m privileged to be in this role of working with you in the Senate to make sure that we resource that effort,” Pence said about the cybersecurity issue.\n“We will work together in whatever roles we inhabit,” Kaine shot back.\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is targeting what he calls Hillary Clinton’s “corrupt criminal syndicate.”\n“‘I am a victim of one of the great political smear campaigns in our country,” Trump told a crowd of supporters in Charlotte. “They are coming after me to try and destroy what is considered by even them (points to the media section) the greatest movement in the history of our country. There’s never been anything been anything like this.”\nAs the crowd cheered, Trump added:\nBill O’Reilly and others have said it’s the single biggest political phenomena in his lifetime, and others have said the same thing. The political establishment is trying to stop us, because they know we are a threat to their totally corrupt control. It’s true.\nNo one is more corrupt than crooked Hillary Clinton. Nobody. In fact, she’s the most corrupt person to ever seek the presidency of the United States of America. And her specialty, if you look over the years, has been character assassination, and really, personally, just going after people. That’s her specialty. She’s been doing it her whole career.\nThe only force strong enough to smash Clinton’s corrupt criminal syndicate is you, the American voter.\n“After many, many years, even decades, without complaint, the media and the Clinton campaign have brought forward false allegations less than a month before the most important election in modern times,” he said. The crowd booed. “These allegations are one hundred percent false, as everybody—I think you know. I think you get it.”\n“They’re made up. They never happened. When have you met tens of thousands of people as I have?—and I’ve met thousands and thousands and thousands of people—know them, know them well. It’s not hard to find a small handful of people willing to make false smears for personal fame,” he said. “Who knows, maybe for financial reasons. Political purposes. Or, for the simple reason they want to stop our movement. They want to stop our campaign. Very simple.”\nThese claims defy reason, logic, common sense. They’re made without supporting witnesses. No witnesses. Twenty-eight years ago. Ten years ago, 14 years ago, 12 years ago. Not me. Believe me, not me, not me. You would be very impressed, actually, with my life in so many regards, including that regard. Not a single shred of evidence. Eyewitnesses have already debunked the wild and ludicrous allegations of a magazine article that appeared, and I’ll tell you what, it was just incredible. It was People magazine, and the article appeared, and a statement was made. But if it’s true, they would have put it in the article. They would have had to put it into the article. But they didn’t do that. And they didn’t do that for a simple reason: Because it never happened, twelve years ago. Never complained, never talked to the bosses.\n“All of a sudden, two nights ago, we get a call, and the call is from People magazine,” he continued. “They didn’t even want a quote. I think maybe what we should do is boycott that issue of People magazine.”\nSo that’s the way it is. I just want to tell you folks, it is a campaign that’s amazing, and I’m not going to be talking about it much because we’re talking about other things, and we have to talk about other things. But if affects five percent, or two percent, or ten percent, or—it’s all false stuff. It’s all a concerted effort. And I think it’s the only way they’re going to stop us. The only way. And I don’t think that’s going to happen.\nAt that point, the crowd booed as demonstrators were escorted out of the rally.\n“That’s the only way we get the cameras to turn!” Trump said as newsmen panned the rally, looking for the protesters.\nOn Thursday, Trump targeted the leftist press in a blistering speech for rolling out women who sought to accuse him of inappropriate touching less than a month before election day.\nThis election will determine whether we are a free nation or whether we have only the illusion of democracy, but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system, and our system is rigged. This is reality, you know it, they know it, I know it, and pretty much the whole world knows it. The establishment and their media enablers will control over this nation through means that are very well known. Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe, and morally deformed,” Trump said in West Palm Beach, Florida. “They will attack you, they will slander you, they will seek to destroy your career and your family, they will seek to destroy everything about you, including your reputation. They will lie, lie, lie, and then again they will do worse than that, they will do whatever is necessary. The Clintons are criminals, remember that. They’re criminals.\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook. Visit Breitbart's Facebook Page.",[],1191,1,0.01191,3e-05,0.011940000000000001
"Lynne Patton, vice president of the Eric Trump Foundation, writes that black voters are flocking to presidential candidate Donald Trump much more than previous Republicans because of the Democrats’ “broken promises.”\nFrom The Hill:\nNo racial group has suffered more from illegal immigration than Black America. Yet the question remains: Will large numbers of African-Americans finally vote Republican and help Donald Trump build his wall and rebuild America? In our opinion, the answer is a resounding yes.\nBlacks represent 31 percent of the population in Georgia, 22 percent in North Carolina, 20 percent in Virginia, 16 percent in Florida, 14 percent in Michigan, 12 percent in Ohio, 11 percent in Pennsylvania, and 10 percent in Nevada. These are critical swing states where the black vote could very well turn out to be the swing vote.\nAt 15 percent (IBD/TIPP), Donald Trump has nearly double — some polls place him at triple — the African-American support of the last two Republican nominees for President combined. Something you’ll never hear, nor read, in the mainstream media. We credit this record-breaking support to his sharp business acumen and the fact that he is not a career politician, but rather a candidate with common sense solutions to fix the failed policies that have plagued the minority community for far too long. Above all, we credit it to the fact that minorities are tired of the same broken promises every four years.\nRead the rest of the story here.\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"ERIE, Pennsylvania — Indiana Governor and Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence took the stage at Penn State Behrend for his final solo rally of the 2016 presidential election cycle on Monday, where he urged the crowd to “ensure, here and now, in Pennsylvania, that Hillary Clinton will never be elected president of the United States of America.”\nThe crowd chanted, “lock her up!” a reference to the FBI investigation into the former secretary of state’s private email server and the Clinton Foundation. At one point, Mike Pence said, “we cannot have four more years apologizing to our enemies and a abandoning our friends.”\nCrowd goes wild as @mike_pence and @firstladyIN step onto stage @PSBehrend for last solo rally of election cycle #Election2016 pic.twitter.com/eJlWVUNUrQ\n— Adelle Nazarian (@AdelleNaz) November 7, 2016\nSomeone shouted, “Justice for all!” from the crowd.\n“We’ve got a basket of the American people that are saying enough is enough,” Pence said.\nHe focused his final solo talk on fixing taxes, implementing regulations, revitalizing American energy, trade, and the Supreme Court.\n“From the man who wrote The Art of The Deal, trade is going to mean jobs. But trade is going to mean American jobs first,” Pence assured. “We are going to renegotiate NAFTA, we are going to get out of this trans-Pacific thing, and hold all our trade partners accountable for the commitments they make to all our partners all around the world.”\nPence arrived in Pennsylvania, fresh off the plane from another rally in Traverse City, Michigan.\nThis crowd in Traverse City, #Michigan is tremendous. #Panorama pic.twitter.com/0ZpY3XTVaw\n— Adelle Nazarian (@AdelleNaz) November 7, 2016\n“We are leading in every national poll after another and we are going to win this thing,” Pence said at the airport at Michigan’s Cherry Capital Airport. “This election is not just a choice between two people. It’s a choice between two futures,” Pence said.\n“I choose the stronger America. I choose a more prosperous America. I choose an America that chooses and upholds our highest Constitutional liberties, so I choose to stand with Donald Trump.”\nIn Pennsylvania, Pence said that Clinton wants to raise taxes by a trillion dollars, whereas “Donald Trump will lower taxes,” so that families and businesses can thrive. “We’re going to use American energy to power an American comeback.”\nThe crowd cheered.\n“We’re gonna drain the swamp,” he said. “We’re gonna put our common sense, conservative principles into practice and we’re gonna get this economy working for everyone.”\nAccording to polls, Pennsylvania is leaning Democrat, and Clinton has an approximately a 4-point lead over Trump in the Keystone State, which brings 20 Electoral College votes with it.\nPence recalled how he received an 11 p.m. phone call from Trump, whose voice he described as “familiar,” and that he said, “‘Mike, it’s gonna be great.’ And it has been. And it will be when we elect Donald Trump as president of the United States.”\nBefore ending his final solo rally, he invited his wife Karen — Indiana’s First Lady — up on stage. His voice sounded filled with pride and emotion as he told the crowd, “we’ve done it together.” Their daughter Charlotte has also been traveling the campaign trail with them.\nPence completes Monday evening with two other rallies in New Hampshire and Michigan.

"The organized outrage over President-elect Trump’s plans to deport up to 2,000,000 criminal aliens has the look and smell of identity politics.\nHow and why convicted criminals became a privileged political constituency instead of over law abiding legal immigrants remains a mystery.\nThe identity politics behind “sanctuary cities” failed Hillary Clinton miserably, and it may yet prove to be the Achilles heel of big city Democrat mayors as well.\nThere’s a new sheriff in town, and he has both the law and public opinion on his side. Sanctuary city advocates in Los Angeles, Denver, Atlanta, New York and other cities are about to be confronted by a Congress and federal law enforcement agencies united in a simple mission: to enforce the law.\nNews bulletin: Deporting criminal aliens is not a new concept.\nIt was accepted policy across the nation until Political Correctness replaced common sense. Are citizens in rebellion against deporting the 6,000-plus criminal aliens currently serving jail terms in Colorado’s local jails and state prison facilities? No, only the political establishment finds the idea repugnant.\nMemo to Governors Brown, Hickenlooper and Cuomo: Your political stupidity is no longer protected by the Obama White House and Justice Department. You will soon experience the full force of federal law enforcement backed by congressional funding prohibitions and public outrage over your criminally negligent behavior.\nThe Trump administration and Congress understand that sanctuary city policies have nothing to do with protecting children and families. Obstructing the legitimate enforcement of federal immigration law is about protecting convicted criminals from the consequences of their criminal behavior. Urban politicians will soon learn there are consequences for their criminally negligent behavior as well.\nThere is considerable hypocrisy in the statements issued this past week by mayors and governors proclaiming, “We will not help federal officials enforce federal immigration law.”\n- The 2012 US Supreme Court case arising from Arizona’s attempt to supplement federal penalties against illegal aliens affirmed not only the supremacy of federal law over state law, it also affirmed state responsibilities as a full partner in the enforcement of immigration law.\n- It is grossly contradictory for any state official to celebrate federal supremacy in immigration law — as sanctuary advocates did following the 2012 Arizona ruling — while simultaneously refusing to help enforce those same federal laws that have preempted state law. The last governor to defy the enforcement of legitimate federal law was George Wallace, and that did not work out very well.\nAs to the arguments heard every day in defense of sanctuary city policies, they are hollow and unpersuasive to most Americans.\n- Can “immigrant family unity” be disrupted by the conviction and eventual deportation of a criminal alien? Yes. But please ask your local Social Justice Warrior this question: why is that more unfortunate and unacceptable than the consequences suffered by the family of a citizen or legal immigrant who is convicted of auto theft, assault, murder, or selling heroin or methamphetamines?\n- When did “family unity” become an escape hatch only for illegal aliens but not for anyone else? Is it because any proposal to adopt it as a legal principle applicable to all criminal defendants would be laughed out of town?\nThe inconvenient truth is that ending sanctuary city policies is a step toward equal justice for all, citizen and illegal immigrant alike. Criminal aliens are not deserving of additional protections not available to citizens and legal immigrants.\nEnding criminal aliens’ exemptions from federal law enforcement will mean removing tens of thousands of dangerous felons from our communities. Why is that goal even controversial? Ask the Service Employee International Union (SEIU), whose membership and treasury have ballooned under sanctuary policies.\nWhat are the real numbers? How many criminal aliens will be affected by the unobstructed enforcement of federal immigration law?\n- A 2011 report by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that in 2010 there were 55,000 illegal aliens in federal prisons and in 2009, there were 296,000 in state and local facilities.\n- ICE documents reveal that there are over 925,000 criminal aliens who have exhausted their appeals and been ordered deported by a court of law but not yet processed for deportation.\n- The federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) in 2014 estimated there are 1.9 million deportable criminal aliens under current federal law.\nAs everyone knows, President Obama restricted the list of crimes that trigger deportation to a small number of violent felonies, not all felonies. As a result, since 2010 annual deportation numbers declined dramatically.\nPresident Trump may decide to simply tell ICE agents, “Enforce the law as written by Congress.” In that case, ICE might well start deportation processing for all 1.9 million criminal aliens deportable under current law. Or, Trump could decide to limit initial deportations to all felons. The point is that Trump wants to enforce the law instead of ignoring the law. What a novel concept!\nHow many criminal aliens does each state have? That information is not readily available but can be found through diligent sifting through government documents, especially the annual reports by the US Department of Justice on reimbursement grants to state and local jails under the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). It is astonishing how many newspaper reporters have never looked at those annual reports and reported on the number of criminal aliens in local jails.\n- To take the example of Colorado, which ranks about tenth nationally in the number of criminal aliens in local jails, the Colorado Department of Corrections (CDOC) publishes an annual count of criminal aliens held in the state prison system as defined by the federal SCAAP guidelines.\n- In 2015, Colorado held 1,893 “ICE eligible’ criminal aliens and received a federal reimbursement grant of $1,170,973 — or about 2% of the actual annual cost of incarceration — $36,892 per inmate or $69,836,556.\n- Thus, in 2015 alone, the taxpayers of Colorado were out over $68 million in unreimbursed costs for those 1,893 criminal aliens.\n- Colorado has received a total of $64,596,162 in federal reimbursement grants since 1995. CDOC determined in 2008 that the federal reimbursement was only 8 cents on the dollar, so we have to multiply that $64 million figure by 12 to get the true, cumulative cost to state taxpayers. That amount is $774 million in cumulative unreimbursed costs to Colorado taxpayers.\nWhat the state CDOC data do not reveal is that local jails in Colorado also receive annual SCAAP reimbursement grants for partial reimbursement of the costs to county taxpayers. In 2015 that total was $1,408,900 — more than the state prison system’s grant.\n- Since the jail terms of inmates in local county jails are typically 30 to 90 days and always less than a full year, that $1.4 million figure suggests that the number of criminal aliens held in local jails in 2015 was over 5,000 statewide.\n- Adding those two numbers together, 1,893 in state prisons plus at least 5,000 in local jails stateeide, we find that Colorado in 2015 had over 6,500 criminal aliens recycling through its penal institutions.\nIn 2016 across the nation, the total number of criminal aliens in our jails and prisons is more than 300,000.\nNow, ask yourself — what is the difference in how those convicted criminals are treated in Sanctuary cities and states compared to places where federal law is being enforced? What happens to those 300,000 convicted criminals when they are released from jail in 2016 or 2017? Under sanctuary policies, how many would be turned over to ICE and deported? The answer: only a small fraction.\nIt is not public opinion that stands in the way of deporting all criminal alien felons. Even in progressive California, a large majority of citizens support deportation policies. A University of California survey in 201 5 discovered that 74% of Californians oppose sanctuary policies — including 71% of Democrats and 65% of Latinos.\nAmericans are tired of identity politics, tired of releasing criminal aliens back into the community, and tired of excuses by politicians who put political correctness ahead of public safety.\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"2ndVote, a conservative watchdog group for corporate advocacy, is launching a campaign — #AnywhereButTARGET — ahead of Black Friday and the holiday shopping season.\nAccording to 2ndVote’s press release, the campaign is meant to allow communication between Target and conservatives based on Target’s restroom policy, which allows individuals to use any restroom based on gender identity rather than biology.\nThe #AnywhereButTARGET campaign is also meant to provide alternative retailers for conservatives.\n2ndVote Executive Director Lance Wray issued a statement saying this campaign will “send a clear and direct message to Target,” which Wray describes as a company “that seems to care more about a radical political agenda than common sense and safety of its own customers.”\nWray continued:\n2ndVote is calling on conservative consumers to engage the country’s second largest retailer on its company-wide policy that allows and encourages individuals to choose restroom and changing room facilities based on gender identity rather than biological sex. Immediate pushback from conservatives forced Target to spend $20 million to add gender neutral bathrooms to its stores shortly after announcing the policy earlier this year.\nThe #AnywhereButTARGET campaign comes at the beginning of the busiest shopping season when major retailers, like Target, expect to bring in over 30% of their annual revenue.\nConcerned Women for America President and CEO Penny Nance is also encouraging the members of her organization, which promotes biblical principles, to shop elsewhere this holiday season.\n“At Concerned Women for America (CWA), we know we can’t just vote with a ballot, we must also vote with our wallets. Our hope is that Target will hear our vote loud and clear this holiday season,” Nance explained in a statement to Breitbart News, adding:\nTarget’s decision to open their restrooms to transgendered individuals, who are only 0.3% of the population, is not an issue of inclusivity, it’s an issue of public safety. There are 293,066 victims of rape each year, and the fact that more than 33% of these sexual assaults happen in public places like restrooms should be of concern to Target. My concern is the hundreds of thousands sexual offenders who take advantage of opportunities such as the one Target is presenting. Target has endangered the safety and privacy of women and children in their stores, so CWA and its hundreds of thousands of members will be taking our business elsewhere.\nTarget has not yet responded to a request for comment about #AnywhereButTarget from Breitbart News.\n“Conservatives have many other options to Target this season and that’s why we’re choosing #AnywhereButTARGET,” Wray added about 2ndVote’s campaign. “When a company as large and well-known as Target chooses to insert itself directly into such a radical movement that seeks to ultimately destroy religious liberty and completely goes against our conservative values, it’s our role as an organization to give conservatives a way to communicate directly with the company.”\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"Donald Trump won’t be president for another two months, and yet already he is scoring successes for American workers, as the deal to keep a thousand or more jobs at the Carrier Corporation reminds us.\nOn November 30, a jubilant Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, tweeted out, “1000 Families will have a better Christmas & future because @realDonaldTrump cared enough to fight for them.” And then he added this apt jibe: “Where was @BarackObama—Useless.”\nThe following day, December 1, the President-elect visited the Carrier plant in Indianapolis. In his visit, thronged by grateful workers, Trump took time to highlight the good news: that is, not only the jobs saved, but also the $16 million in new investment that Carrier will make—which will, of course, ultimately create more jobs. As Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on Thursday, “Today America won and we have Donald Trump to thank.”\nOf course, any success for Trump is a defeat for the MSM. And so The New York Times struck back, packing such loaded phrases as “frenetic activity,” “impulsive gestures,” “compulsively theatrical,” and “headline grabbing” into one of its myriad of anti-Trump stories.\nFor its part, The Washington Post was equally eager to undercut Trump’s triumph, suggesting that it was somehow un-presidential for Trump to roll up his sleeves and actually fight for American jobs; evidently, the Post prefers President Barack Obama’s “what me worry?” attitude of aloof indifference. Indeed, in June of this year, Obama, asked about the jobs that have gone overseas during his presidency, pronounced to an audience that “Those jobs of the past are just not going to come back.”\nOh, but wait, there was one time when Obama personally tried to get something done for the American people: That was his 2009 trip to Copenhagen, Denmark, to pitch Chicago as the site of the 2016 Olympics. As we all remember, he failed; in fact, Chicago was eliminated in the first round. As Hannity said of him, useless.\nReturning to the present day, the Post insinuated this nitpicking commentary on Trump’s job-keeping success into the fourth paragraph of its “news” story:\nExperts said no modern president has intervened on behalf of an individual company, a move that amounts to the nation’s highest office choosing winners and losers in the economy. Conservatives have long decried such incentive packages as distorting free markets, while liberals have characterized them as corporate subsidies.\nFor his part, Trump took time not only to rebut the quibbling, but also double down on his activism. That is, he promised to do it again if need be:\nI think it’s very presidential . . . We’re going to have a lot of phone calls made to companies when they say they’re leaving this country because they’re not going to leave this country.\nTo be sure, a few media outlets recognized Trump’s achievement: The New York Post headlined, “Donald Trump is already helping the working class,” adding:\nSure, it’s unusual for a president-elect to interject himself in the economic mechanizations of a specific company—let alone the economy writ large—but everything about Trump being the next president is unusual.\nYes, that’s a fair statement: Trump is unusual. But he just won a presidential election, carrying 30 states and more than 300 electoral votes—and in recent decades, that’s been decidedly unusual for a Republican.\nIndeed, Trump can now be thought of as the opposite of a “lame duck”—that being a politician, still in office, who has lost his mojo. Instead, Trump has demonstrable clout even before taking the oath office.\nIn the meantime, it’s a safe bet that the average American is thinking to himself or herself: If it takes “unusual” to save my job and other Americans’ jobs, too, then please, let’s have more unusual!\nSo, even though his inauguration is nearly eight weeks away, we are learning more about how Trump will lead and govern as our 45th president. Specifically, we can identify a quintet of key characteristics:\n- He will keep his promises and keep in close touch with his supporters, as well as all Americans. And if that means bypassing the MainStream Media, well, the MSM will have to deal with it.\n- As befits the author of the classic book, The Art of the Deal, he will be a hands-on, deal-making activist on behalf of jobs and growth.\n- He will adopt an inclusive, even magnanimous, approach to governing, befitting a leader who has pledged to be president for all Americans. And that means making room, at least a little, for even “Never Trump” Republicans.\n- He will govern in a common-sense spirit, however politically incorrect.\n- He will uphold center-right American nationalism, even if the liberal elite hates it.\nIt’s all starting to add up to something big—something that might soon be known as the Trump Deal.\nLet’s look at each in turn:\n1) Keeping promises, keeping in touch. Immediately after the election, the much-reviled TransPacific Partnership, which Trump had vociferously denounced, was tossed out the window. This defeat for “America Last” globalism came as a painful shock to Obama and also to his establishment Republican allies, such as Ohio Governor John Kasich, who visited the White House in September, as part of an obvious attempt to undercut Trump’s candidacy. Indeed, Kasich has been doubly pained; in November, Trump carried the Buckeye State by more than eight points over Hillary Clinton.\nMeanwhile, the President-elect is on his post-election “Donald J. Trump USA Thank You Tour 2016,” emphasizing, yet again, that he is serious about keeping his campaign promises. For example, as he said in Indiana, “Trust me, we are going to build that wall.”\nAt the same time, his social-media machine continues to churn, leaving the MSM to spin its wheels. In a revealing November 29 Breitbart piece headlined, “Under the Hood: How Donald Trump Has Cut Around Corporate Media to Reach Millions Directly Online,” reporter Matthew Boyle summed up the efforts of Trump social media director Dan Scavino: During the campaign, Scavino oversaw an operation that generated 21 billion Facebook impressions, 1.3 billion video views, and nearly 50 million “likes.” Meanwhile, on Twitter, Trump’s posts, beaming out to 16.2 million followers, enjoyed nearly nine billion impressions. All in all, 36 million people were within his personal social media reach.\nYet the heart of this social-media cornucopia was Trump himself. As Scavino put it,\nThe success to our social media platforms comes directly from then-candidate, and now President-elect of the United States of America, Donald J. Trump. It is all Mr. Trump and his messaging. Whether Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram platforms, Mr. Trump is directly involved with our social media messaging. He loves communicating with the American people, and he loves seeing what is going out.\nWhich is to say, any curious American, fan or foe, can click on “All Trump, all the time.” Of course, Trump’s instant accessibility is bothersome to the MSM, which has enjoyed its “gatekeeper” function for so long. To which millions of Americans might say, “Too bad!”\nIndeed, some are even willing to take this new-media reality to the next level. As Sean Hannity, a leading Trump ally, has boldly suggested, perhaps Trump doesn’t need the MSM at all anymore. Hannity says of the press:\nThey lie. They’re corrupt. They’re dishonest. They collude. They’re all in this hyperventilating mode about “fake news” now, but they are fake news. That’s them. It’s now on display for the world to see.\nThen the Fox man added this bombshell of a recommendation:\nI suggested the other day that if any of these organizations were involved in collusion with the Clinton campaign, why do they get a seat in the White House press office? Why does Donald Trump need a White House press office?\nThese are, indeed, provocative questions. The rest of us can observe: If the MSM is relentlessly hostile, and if Trump can reach the American people without the MSM, then the logic of Hannity’s argument starts to come into focus.\n2) Deal-making activist. Already, since the election, the stock market is up, hiring is up, consumer confidence is up to the highest level in nearly a decade, surveys of Wall Street analysts show widespread optimism, and the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development has raised its growth forecast for the US economy.\nStill, it’s worth recalling that Trump isn’t even president; he hasn’t had a chance, yet, to implement the promises he made at Gettysburg, PA on October 22, including, “lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion worth of job-producing American energy reserves.” That is, energy resources currently strangled by government red tape. Yet even now, investors are factoring Trump’s pro-growth policies into their bullish projections.\nWe might note that Trump will not be the only big-thinking deal-maker in his administration. As Politico reported on November 30, Trump’s choice of Steven Mnuchin as the next treasury secretary comes with Mnuchin’s declaration that new investments in infrastructure will be a “high priority.”\nIn addition, Mnuchin strongly praised Trump’s work to keep Carrier in Indiana, labeling it “terrific,” recalling,\nThe president-elect and the vice president-elect picked up the phone and called the CEO of the United Technologies and told them we want to keep jobs here. Can’t remember the last time a president did that and this is going to be a terrific opportunity.\nMoreover, Mnuchin suggested that more such deals would be in the making. To be sure, the Carrier deal is “only” 1000 jobs, in an economy that employs 124.7 million. So yes, of course, America not only needs better deal-making, it also needs better policy-making. And the Trump-Pence administration pledges just that: tax reduction and reform, deregulation, and more energy production, just for starters.\nAs Trump said on December 1, his mission is to “reverse the stagnation and usher in a period of prosperity and growth.” Then he added:\nWe’ll compete in the world, we want to compete in the world, but we’re going to compete in the world where it’s a two-way road, not a one-way road. The advantages are going to come back to our country, and they haven’t for many, many years.\nAnd once again, political hope is on its way to becoming an administration-wide policy reality. Here’s the front-page headline in The Washington Post: “Trump nominees map out plans for tax cuts, trade and Carrier-style negotiations.” As Mnuchin also noted:\nIt starts with an attitude of this administration. This president, this vice president-elect is going to have open communications with business leaders.\nNeedless to say, Trump’s deal-making for jobs and profits horrifies ivory-tower ideologues and Trump haters. Here, for example, is a tweet in response to the Carrier deal from Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI), a hardcore libertarian:\nNot the president-elect’s job. We live in a constitutional republic, not an autocracy. Business-specific meddling shouldn’t be normalized.\nAnd The Wall Street Journal editorial page—long a hotbed of Never Trump globalism—also chimed in with a critique. Reading their words, an ordinary American might fairly conclude: These libertarian ideologues care more about their intellectual abstractions than flesh-and-blood workers. And we might further note that such intellectual abstractions have a funny way of always serving the interests of Wall Street globalists.\nMeanwhile, many on the left also criticized the deal, including Binyamin Applebaum of The New York Times:\nIt is impossible to assess the merits of the Carrier deal until we know why the company changed its mind–and at what cost to taxpayers.\nAnd Ralph Nader, too, tut-tutted.\nIn addition, bitter-ender Never Trumpers, such as Amanda Carpenter —now happily ensconced at CNN—will never miss a chance to trash Trump, even when he saves US jobs.\nYet even so, some practical-minded Democrats are climbing on board the Trump Express. Here are the words of Virginia’s Democratic governor Terry McAuliffe, a longtime supporter of Bill and Hillary Clinton:\nDefense spending, infrastructure—if we can work together on those things, we’re gonna have a good, healthy relationship. The elections are over. Politics is done. Let’s get to work.\nOne needn’t be fond of McAuliffe nonetheless to recognize this reality: When leaders work together on behalf of job-creating projects, well, it’s more likely that jobs indeed will be created.\nIndeed, one can see an emerging political model of, yes, Putting America First. As Trump said on his trip, “Companies are not going to leave the United States anymore without consequences.” And that means that the breezy assumption—so dominant during the Clinton, Bush 43, and Obama administrations—that outsourcing and offshoring are inevitable, even desirable, is over.\nIn fact, across the country, it’s likely that vulnerable American workers are delighted: Finally, a president who remembers the Forgotten Man, and the Forgotten Woman.\n3) Inclusive approach to governing. Here we can start by recalling Trump’s selection of Mike Pence as his running mate; Pence, of course, is not only from the heartland, but also straight from the heart of the GOP. And there was the choice also of another insider, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, to be White House chief of staff.\nMost recently, we can note Trump’s selection of Elaine Chao—a presidential appointee in the last three Republican administrations—as his secretary of transportation. (Chao, of course, is also the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.)\nAnd then there’s the case of Mitt “Never Trump” Romney. If Trump can forgive him, and even share a cozy meal, then obviously he has the capacity to forgive, and perhaps include, anyone.\nOnce again, not everyone will appreciate every last one of Trump’s personal, or personnel, choices. But our purpose here is not to praise what Trump does but, rather, to inventory the early clues we are seeing about his governing style. And mixing in GOP insiders is definitely a part of that style.\n4) New spirit of common sense. As George Orwell once put it, “The heresy of heresies is common sense.” As for Trump, his entire campaign has been about common sense, starting with such obvious goals as closing the border to terrorists, standing up for law and order, and rebuilding America’s infrastructure.\nIndeed, the post-election evidence indicates that Trump’s approach is winning people over, despite the polarization and hard feelings of the last year. And that seems to be a testament to the gut appeal of his commonsensical approach.\nOf course, with Trump, a lot of it starts with Twitter. And that’s wise, because as we know, the MSM hasn’t gotten any friendlier.\nAnd so, operating outside of the MSM’s onetime monopoly, Trump has gotten to work. On November 21, for example, he placed a condolence call to the family of slain San Antonio police officer Benjamin Marconi. (Not only did Obama not call, but it’s a safe bet that nobody in the White House even thought to suggest it.)\nMore recently, Trump has taken up the issue of burning the American flag: He’s against it, and he thinks flag-burners should be punished. Of course, the President-elect’s stance on basic patriotism has evoked much pearl-clutching among establishmentarians; they declare that even the most odious anti-American behavior is “protected free speech.”\nYet what these pearl-clutchers don’t say is that burning Old Glory has only been “protected speech” since a 1989 Supreme Court decision. And as we all know, the Court can reverse itself at any time—and perhaps a Trumpified SCOTUS will do just that.\nIn addition, Trump undoubtedly spoke for the vast majority of Americans when he tweeted out, in the wake of the latest incident of domestic terrorism, at Ohio State University on November 28, that the Somali refugee who committed the attack “should not have been in our country.” We can add: There aren’t enough NPR reporters in the country to talk the average American out of agreeing with Trump on that one.\nAs Trump said in Cincinnati on December 1, our current immigration and asylum policies have been “stupidly created by our very stupid politicians.” And he further pledged, “We will suspend immigration from regions where it cannot be safely processed.” We can add that this paradigm-shift is especially urgent since the Obama administration is in the process of admitting thousands of potentially dangerous refugees that have been rejected by Australia. That’s right: Under current policy, we are now taking an allied country’s rejects.\nNow let’s look at another f’rinstance that illuminates how Trump thinks, on the one hand, and how the MSM thinks, on the other. Here’s a headline from the left-wing magazine, The New Republic, on November 30: “What Will Happen to Chelsea Manning Under President Trump? Trump has threatened to review the military’s transgender policies, putting the whistleblower’s future at risk.”\nWe all recall the case of Chelsea Manning, aka Bradley Manning, the Army soldier who leaked hundreds of thousands of classified documents in 2010. Manning was prosecuted under the Espionage Act and sentenced to 35 years in prison.\nAnd once in prison, Manning declared that he was a she. And so, bolstered by a slew of ACLU lawyers, Manning demanded a sex-change operation, as well as associated hormone treatments. That’s right, a criminal demanded such a remarkable medical dispensation, with, of course, the insistence that Uncle Sam pay it. Not surprisingly, the Obama administration quickly agreed.\nThus we can step back and see: The left has slipped into the dialogue the silly notion that gender-reassignment surgery—which costs $30-50 thousand, not including hormone treatments, etc.—is just another worthy form of “healthcare.” And so, of course, as with Obamacare, the government should pay for it.\nNow we can pause for a moment to recall that Trump himself has zero anti-gay animus. Indeed, in his Cleveland acceptance speech, Trump carefully articulated the words, “LGBTQ” as he recalled the terrorist attack in Orlando, FL. And he also invited Peter Thiel, the gay Silicon Valley mogul, to speak for him to the conventioneers.\nYet still, Trump has kept his perspective, distinguishing between basic human rights and foolish liberal boondoggles. And so during the fall campaign, Trump challenged the “politically correct” Obama policy of “social engineering,” adding that instances such as the Manning case were “ridiculous.”\nYet as The New Republic sobbed:\nIt took Army officials nearly 18 months after she sought treatment for gender dysphoria to approve her for hormone treatments, but she is still required to conform to male military dress standards.\nAnd the magazine further worries that under a Trump administration, “She would probably be the first person to lose care”—care being defined, of course, as including costly gender-reassignment surgery. Meanwhile, the rest of us can say: Manning is a criminal, and maybe this is what a true punishment looks like.\n5) Uphold center-right American nationalism. It wasn’t so long ago, 2008, to be exact, that Obama traveled to Berlin to address his worldwide audience as “citizens of the world.” To which the proper response, of course, is that to be a “citizen of the world” is to be a citizen of nowhere.\nTrump, of course, has always seen things differently from Obama: As he also said in Cleveland, “Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.”\nIn the meantime, we are starting to see, more and more, that pro-American philosophy translated into personnel. It’s been obvious for a long time that Trump admires generals; indeed, on December 1, he picked another one, Marine Gen. James Mattis, to be his secretary of defense.\nSo what might the rest of us conclude from Trump’s choices so far? This much is obvious: Trump respects the military uniform, and those who made the conscious choice, decades ago, to don that uniform on behalf of the nation, thereby assuming the greatest possible personal risk.\nIndeed, we can go further, and make a larger point about American nationalism: It’s hard to think of any category of American that more epitomizes the patriotic, nationalist spirit than the man or woman who volunteers to shoulder the burden of our national defense.\nOf course, not everyone agrees: According to the MSM and most professors, nationalist sentiments are to be deemed only as “racist,” or “xenophobic.”\nYet here’s a dissenting view from a self-declared gay liberal, Jonathan Haidt of New York University, writing in The American Interest. Haidt maintains that nationalism is, ultimately, an expression of affection, even love, for one’s own fellow citizens—nothing more, and nothing less:\nNationalists see patriotism as a virtue; they think their country and its culture are unique and worth preserving. This is a real moral commitment, not a pose to cover up racist bigotry. Some nationalists do believe that their country is better than all others, and some nationalisms are plainly illiberal and overtly racist. But as many defenders of patriotism have pointed out, you love your spouse because she or he is yours, not because you think your spouse is superior to all others.\nThanks to the hard work and heroism of Gen. Mattis, Gen. Mike Flynn, and all the other military officers in Trump’s orbit—along with, of course, the efforts of all other active-duty personnel and veterans—those who don’t agree with Haidt are free to express their contrary opinion.\nYet in the meantime, those who agree with Trump, Mattis, Flynn, et al. are equally free to express their opinion. (Except, of course, on PC college campuses.)\nAs Trump said on December 1:\nWe are going to bring our country together, all of our country. We’re going to find common ground, and we will get the job done properly.\nGod bless Donald Trump for seeking to bring the country together. And yet here we can say, with all due respect, that perhaps the President-elect was being a bit, shall we say, aspirational. That is, do we really think that George Soros, Al Sharpton, and their legions of paid and unpaid protestors are ever going to clasp hands with Trump?\nYet as we have seen, Trump is ready, if need be, to do battle—and he has the tools he needs, including a social-media army, a pro-growth action agenda, a basic common sense, and an instinctive pro-American patriotism. And so the battle of is to continue, and it probably will, Trump is well-equipped. In other words, this tweeting and deal-making commander-in-chief will be governing in his inclusive, commonsensical, center-right style.\nYes, the Trump Deal is emerging—and the MSM and the Democrats will just have to deal with it.\nComment count on this article reflects comments made on Breitbart.com and Facebook.

"During his Sunday night interview with Charlie Rose on 60 Minutes, former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon finally said out loud what many of us already knew: that Hillary Clinton is “not very bright.”\nThis was actually my favorite part of the interview because nothing is healthier for our culture than the truth, most especially a truth no one dares to speak out loud.\nFor 25 years, Madam Clinton has been in the public eye, and for 25 years we have been told time and again and again and again two whoppers: 1) Hillary is brilliant. 2) When you get to know her, Hillary is a warm, funny, vibrant real person.\nWe expect Democrats and leftwing activists to tell us this. What else are they going to say? My problem is that it has been the national media, those who pose as objective truth-tellers, who have been spreading and cementing this fable. It is those who wear the uniform of journalists who keep telling us that this bumbling, fumbling, tone deaf, two-time failure is, when you really get to know her, a dazzling personality wrapped around a super-smart brain.\nGranted, I do not know Hillary Clinton. I’ve never met her, nor have I even seen her in person. Nevertheless…\nCOME. ON.\nWe are talking about 25 years in the public eye here, twenty-five freakin’ years of gaffes, whiffed opportunities, serial-humiliations, absurdly transparent lies, needless scandals, and epic fails.\nThe Hillary Clinton who clown-shoe’d her way on to the national stage 25 years ago with, “I’m not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette” (even though time has proved that is exactly who she is), is the exact same stunted-woman who, 25 years later, thought it was smart politics to attack half the country as a “basket of deplorables.”\nHillary Clinton’s public career has been one defined only by stepping on rakes.\nFrom Whitewater to Benghazi.\nFrom cattle futures to uranium.\nFrom Travelgate to Emailgate.\nFrom the “missing” Rose Law Firm billing records to 33,000 deleted emails.\nFrom the speaking fees to the secret server.\nFrom rape-denier to looting the White House.\nFrom the Clinton Foundation to the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation.\nFrom “sniper fire” to “vast rightwing conspiracy” to “stayed at home and baked cookies” to “with a cloth” to Gandhi “ran a gas station” to “I ain’t no ways tired” to “dead broke” to, well, this.\nThis is not partisanship on my part. I’ve seen Bill Clinton’s brilliance. There is no question Chuck Schumer has plenty going on. Barack Obama is not the genius everyone says he is, but Barry’s still plenty smart. Even Nancy Pelosi has shown some true savvy.\nHillary Clinton is just dumb. Plain dumb. Not once during the quarter century that I have suffered under the oppression of her voice, her condescension, her awkward fumbles at being real, have I witnessed her porch lights come on. Not once have I said, There it is!\nAnd all it would take is once.\nI know what the rebuttal is: that dumb people don’t almost become president of these here United States. Let me respond to that in three ways…\n1) No intellectually honest person will tell you Hillary Clinton would be where she is had she not married Bill. That is not a slam on women, plenty of whom have emerged from their husband’s shadow to distinguish themselves: Katharine Graham, Arianna Huffington, Eleanor Roosevelt, Abigail Adams, etc. Given a change of fate, we can see each one of these women succeeding in some way all on their own.\nHillary? No.\nSenator Hillary Clinton? No way. New York has way too much political talent to waste on a stiff, awkward, brittle politician with zero people skills.\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton? All she did was log miles. Five years later no one, and I mean no one, not even her biggest supporters, can name a single accomplishment.\nDemocrat Presidential Nominee Hillary Clinton? Don’t make me laugh.\n2) If you trust me on nothing else, trust me on this. Having now served time in the worlds of entertainment and media, the dirty little secret of both is that naked ambition, driving persistence; unbridled, unscrupulous, shameless scraping and grasping allows many, many, many, too many marginal people to fail upwards.\nHillary Clinton might be a few clowns short of a circus, but she is pantsuited ambition personified. There is nothing she will not do to get what she wants, no person she will not destroy, no humiliation she will not suffer, no indignity she will not dignify. And going back to ancient Rome, the quality of naked ambition has always made up for so many others, including smarts.\n3) The media. Hillary is a leftwing Democrat loathed by the media’s numero uno enemies: Republicans and everyday Americans. So of course the Sisterhood of the Andrea Mitchells and all those media metrosexuals who bow to feminist politics have propped her up over the years.\n—\nTo be clear, I am in no way saying that Hillary is a stupe. There is no question that in the same way Rain Man can count toothpicks, Hillary can booklearn. But native intelligence? Common sense? Being able to grasp a room, a situation, a people, a country? Yeah, no. She’s an idiot.\nWithout Bill, without the media, I think we all know where Hillary Clinton would be right at this very moment… Forever-tenured Professor Rodham sitting in a cluttered, smelly, Womyn’s Study office deep within the bowels of some Ivy League university; a bitter feminist still clinging to her one claim to fame, her time with the Watergate committee (before she was fired). In other words, she would be no one and nowhere , and even among like-minded colleagues, she’d be something of a joke…\nJust like she is today.\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

"Over the past decade, advertisers have spent untold millions trying to turn Talia Kocar and her peers in the millennial generation into loyal customers. But on a recent afternoon in Santa Monica, Calif., in a kind of consumer torch-passing, Ms. Kocar, 25, watched a focus group of teenagers drink free Snapple and suck Doritos powder off their thumbs while answering questions about their smartphones.\nMs. Kocar works on Wishbone, a social networking application full of breezy polls about pop culture, prom dresses and other fixtures of teenage life. Users — most of them girls — post side-by-side pictures that compare rappers (Lil Wayne or Tyga?), celebrities (Kim Kardashian or Beyoncé?) and the like.\nLike most social media apps, Wishbone users achieve status by amassing friends who vote with a thumb tap. There is a bonus, however, which is that twice a day, Ms. Kocar and her team send a “Daily Dozen” of the best and most popular polls to every Wishbone user. This is somewhat like being named “funniest” or “most clever” in a yearbook: Featured polls are guaranteed a lot of votes, and votes, similar to likes on Facebook, are the coin of Wishbone’s realm.\nMs. Kocar said her first attempts at market research began with trips to Starbucks stores and nail salons, where she would find Wishbone users and ask them what they did and did not like about the app. She got lots of information, but wanted more. Hence, the focus group.\nTeenagers being teenagers, the room was full of angst and contradictions. They love Instagram, the photo-sharing app, but are terrified their posts will be ignored or mocked. They feel less pressure on Snapchat, the disappearing-message service, but say Snapchat can be annoying because disappearing messages make it hard to follow a continuing conversation. They do not like advertisements but also do not like to pay for things.\nAt one point a questioner asked the group when they were least likely to be online. “When I’m in the shower,” a girl responded.\nNobody laughed, because it was barely an exaggeration. About three-quarters of United States teenagers have access to a mobile phone, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center. Most go online daily and about a quarter of them use the Internet “almost constantly.”\nThose numbers have created a growing advertising market and fortunes for apps like Snapchat and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. This year companies are projected to spend $30 billion on in-app advertising in the United States, roughly double what they spent in 2014, according to eMarketer, a research company.\nBut even though these services all have the same core functions — find friends, post pictures, send messages — teenagers juggle them constantly, developing arcane customs for what to post where and ditching one app for another the moment it becomes uncool.\nThat churn leaves an opening for upstarts like Wishbone, which is about a year old and already has about three million monthly users. Since July it has ranked among the top 30 most-downloaded social media apps in Apple’s App Store, according to App Annie, a data and analytics company. But staying there will be tough. Mobile apps are a hit or miss business in which a handful of top players get most of the users and money.\nHoping to get their app in that elite few, people like Ms. Kocar pore through data and turn to focus groups for insight on how to get new users to sign up and old users to stay. Their efforts are a window into how teenage lives are documented on mobile screens.\n“They have immediate social validation or lack of validation at the touch of a button,” said Michael Jones, chief executive of Science Inc., which owns Wishbone. “So if you thought that the immediate gratification generation was two generations ago, you haven’t even seen what immediate gratification looks like until you start spending time with, like, a teen on a phone.”\nA Daily Rotation of Apps\nOne hot afternoon last summer, Leila Khan and Lucy Nemerov, two eighth graders from Palo Alto, Calif., cruised their local mall, scoring free samples at See’s Candies and dropping into Brandy Melville to look at clothes, but not buy. Lucy is an avid Wishbone user, but the app is just one among several that she and her friends rotate through each day.\nTo manage their identities in and obligations to this world in their pockets, they adhere to rules that have somehow been absorbed and adopted by their peers. For instance, that afternoon, since nothing particularly special happened, Lucy posted a few videos to Snapchat — including a clip of me interviewing her — but nothing on Instagram.\nWhy the distinction? Because Instagram is special, Leila explained. On Snapchat, where messages disappear, you can be less selective because there is a lower bar for quality. On Instagram, you have to be careful not to clog your friends’ feeds with a barrage of low-quality pictures that might annoy them.\nThey also regularly delete their Instagram photos so that their profiles never have more than a handful at a time. For comparison, I’m a medium-level Instagram user and have several hundred. They reacted to this information as if it were the smell of warm garbage.\n“I have zero right now,” Lucy said.\n“Yeah, ’cause I’m like, ‘Oh wait, I look stupid in this one,’ ” Leila said.\nSome of Leila’s rules for Instagram include never posting more than one photo a week, avoiding photo filters (too fake) and hashtags (too desperate). She tries to find a timely occasion to post — such as National Watermelon Day — and is so concerned about having the right caption that she keeps a running list of ideas on her iPhone. Neither girl had any such rules for Facebook, because they hardly use it.\nApp makers fear this kind of juggling the way TV networks fear DVRs. Each time someone leaves one app for another, there is a chance that user will never come back. And since apps make money only when users are plugged in and absorbing ads, the number of monthly users is less important than how many users they get each day — and how long they stay.\nSocial media apps and messaging services — Wishbone included — tend to get an outsize portion of their ad revenue from a handful of mobile game makers and other app download ads. But Wishbone is making the not-terribly-crazy bet that as people spend more time with their phones and advertisers become comfortable with the medium, more brands and money will follow.\nFor now big advertisers remain focused on the millennial generation, who, at about 18 to 35 years old, are old enough to buy cars, homes and other big-ticket items. But an early wave is starting to think about the next group, said Erna Alfred Liousas, an analyst at Forrester Research, who said the firm had a number of financial services and media companies ask for studies on the under-17 group.\nAs with coffee and newspapers, the key to a successful app is to make it a daily habit. Which is why in early September, Mr. Jones of Science sat in a cinder block room staring at a computer screen full of data. He was with Benoit Vatere, head of Science’s mobile group, and Peter Pham, the company’s chief business officer, discussing the best time to send push notifications alerting Wishbone users to new polls.\nPush notifications — those incessant reminders that make your phone light up and ding — are the infantry of app warfare, cracking the attention span to remind users that someone on the Internet might be talking about them. All summer Wishbone had been sending out alerts four times a day, but the three men were thinking about adding more and, now that students were back in class, trying to recalibrate around the school day.\n“Can we have a friends feed at noon?” Mr. Jones asked Mr. Vatere. “It would be great to do ‘Your friends have updated.’ ”\n“And you talk about it while you’re at school,” Mr. Pham added.\nEvery generation has its thing, and the last two have been marked by digital technology. One of the big dividing lines between Generation X and millennials was that millennials grew up with the Internet. A big difference between millennials and the next group — the postmillennials — has been smartphones.\nEconomic and cultural changes have an even larger influence, argues Neil Howe, an author and historian who is credited with coining the term “millennial generation.” The Great Recession and its aftermath are likely to make the postmillennial generation more risk-averse, he said. At the same time, today’s kids have absorbed lots of parental advice about online safety and bullying.\n“There’s a whole new curriculum being pushed by Gen X parents and one thing it emphasizes above all is emotional intelligence and being very sensitive to the needs of others,” Mr. Howe said.\nIn surveys, his consulting company, LifeCourse Associates, has found that teenagers are extremely anxious about being criticized on social media and are more conscious than their parents of when an app makes them feel bad — or at least aren’t bashful about saying so.\nDuring the recent focus group at Science, one girl said she showed Instagram ideas to at least three people before posting. Another said she deleted any post that did not garner enough likes. “I post and I just delete, because I don’t want to have, like, never mind,” she said, too ashamed to announce the precise number of likes out loud.\nWishbone sees those anxieties as an opportunity. The app doesn’t ask users to take pictures in which they look “sooo beautiful!!!!,” nor does it require having parents who vacation in Instagram-perfect locales. Users just make funny polls to talk about celebrities, makeup and bands. It is about your tastes, not your identity.\nRajada Victor, a 14-year-old ninth grader who lives in Los Angeles, was seated near the girl who was ashamed of her paltry likes. In a follow-up interview, she said she had grown exhausted by the frenzy for online status but was a regular on Wishbone, which she checks all the time: in class, while walking to school, on weekends.\n“I like the fact that you don’t have to look a certain type of way to post,” she said. “People don’t comment rudely or anything — you’re just comparing stuff.”\nMr. Vatere can see this in the data: Wishbone users frequently describe themselves by their interests — they might like Taylor Swift, for instance — but rarely post personal photos. The app also employs an “everyone gets a trophy” philosophy by having Ms. Kocar and her editorial team choose many different polls, not just the most popular ones, for the coveted Daily Dozen of posts that all Wishbone users vote on.\n“You want to create an environment where it doesn’t feel like only 1 percent of the people win,” said Eric Kuhn, Science’s head of product. “And we’ve heard that with other platforms, like as soon as you’re clearly not in that top 1 percent, you don’t want to use the app anymore.”\nSome Facts and a Hunch\nMr. Jones, a 40-year-old Gen Xer, has tracked youth culture since the grunge ’90s, when he started a magazine called Elixir as a University of Oregon sophomore. This was back when teenagers went to bookstores in search of small-circulation “zines.”\nHe spent the next two decades tracking the migration of media to the web, to social platforms to mobile phones. Elixir became a website and, as Mr. Jones got more interested in the web than publishing, he started a software company called Userplane that was bought by AOL.\nLater Mr. Jones was the chief executive of MySpace, where his job was to try to blunt the ascendance of a new competitor called Facebook. This did not go well.\nHe founded Science four years ago with Mr. Pham. He calls it a “start-up studio” that helps entrepreneurs turn their ideas into businesses. Wishbone is part of Science’s mobile group — which includes several other apps — but Mr. Jones is so enamored with social media that he decided to run the group and Wishbone himself. The Science offices are just a few blocks from the beach in Santa Monica and have requisite start-up touches like exposed ceilings, copious whiteboards and employees who toil quietly while wearing Beats headphones.\nScience has raised about $40 million in venture capital, most of it from Hearst Ventures. After the MySpace debacle, Mr. Jones said he initially steered clear of social media and focused on building online commerce businesses such as Dollar Shave Club, a razor subscription service, and DogVacay, a dog-boarding version of Airbnb, the online home-rental service.\n“Coming out of MySpace I was like, ahhh, this is so hard — social ads is tough,” he said. “Let’s just take a pause.”\nAs social media moved to mobile phones, Mr. Jones figured there would be a chance to get back in. Wishbone came out of a few facts and a hunch. The facts are that people spend several hours a day on their phones, and that teenagers favor apps in which everyone gets to create content and be part of the show.\nThe hunch was that a polling app would do well. Mr. Jones knew from his AOL days that polling was among the most addictive of online features. And since successful mobile apps reward repetitive behavior, he figured polling would translate well to smartphones.\nIf Wishbone were almost anything besides an app, three million users would be a huge success. But apps are a brutal business, where a few gigantic hits like Facebook and YouTube make most of the money. American smartphone owners use about 27 apps per month, but spend about 80 percent of their time in five, according to a recent study by Activate, a consulting firm.\nAnd even the winners can’t rest for long. Facebook, the biggest social network, has tried to defend its top position by buying or trying to buy rival apps as they break through. Facebook tried to buy Snapchat, but was spurned.\nFour years ago the company spent $1 billion to buy Instagram, which at the time had a dozen employees and about 30 million monthly users. Today Instagram has more than 400 million, about a quarter of Facebook’s users.\nWishbone is a long way from that top tier, which is why employees show up to meetings with laptops full of statistics about what teenagers are doing. And it is why they spend time running focus groups.\nRight around Thanksgiving, Mr. Jones, Mr. Pham and Mr. Vatere started rethinking their strategy for sending out push notifications. All through the summer and fall they had been limiting the number of daily alerts on the assumption that, like them, Wishbone users would be annoyed if they were interrupted by too many pings and dings. And, as one might expect when three fathers make an assumption about teenage girls, they could not have been more wrong.\n“We talked to them and they’d be like, ‘Why am I not getting notified when people vote on my stuff?’ ” Mr. Jones said. “And we’d be like, ‘Well, we wouldn’t want to do that ’cause we might send you, like, 50 notifications that you got 50 of your friends to vote on your card.’ They’re like, ‘But that’s what I want.’ ”\n“In fact,” Mr. Jones said, “they would even kind of subtly infer that if they didn’t get at least 50, it was kind of like a bad day.”\nThe same way Gen X measured its worth in answering machine messages, the mobile-minded teenager sees each like and mention as reassurance of an active social life. And when your phone is the default security blanket for enduring the awkwardness of walking a high school hallway, it feels nice to have a bunch of digital hellos ready with a swipe.\nSo just before Thanksgiving weekend, Wishbone opened the fire hose, sending out notifications for everything — every vote, every mention, everything that has to do with a user on the app. A week later they found several key metrics, like voting, had almost doubled.\nOne might ask if teenagers need another distraction. In a recent survey by Common Sense Media, a nonprofit research group, half of teenagers said they watched TV while doing their homework, while 60 percent said they texted and three-quarters said they listened to music.\nThose in the Wishbone focus group said they loved getting notifications but acknowledged getting lost in their phones. One girl said that it had come to the point that the only way she could finish her homework was to put her phone in another room.\n“Sometimes it’s fun ’cause it’s like people are thinking about you and are like, ‘I want to show this to Jada,’ ” said Rajada Victor, the ninth grader in Los Angeles, who goes by Jada. But, she also said, she tries not to become caught up in worrying about social media.\n“I’m focusing on my grades and all that stuff,” she said.\nAnd that’s the thing about teenagers: They grow up.","[""Teenagers being teenagers, the room was full of angst and contradictions.""]",3716,15,0.037160000000000006,0.00045,0.037610000000000005
"WASHINGTON — For the final time, President Obama will mount the rostrum in the House chamber on Tuesday to deliver a State of the Union address. But this time, aides said, he will not bring with him a long list of proposals that will languish in Congress — after all these years, a victory of experience over hope.\nInstead, Mr. Obama plans a thematic message that effectively will be as much a campaign agenda as a governing document. While not on the ballot himself, Mr. Obama hopes to use what may be the largest television audience left in his presidency to frame the debate about who should replace him and where the country should go from here.\nThis is a decisive moment for the two-term president, the pivot point where he goes from priority setter to celebrity spectator in the contest for the future. His speech and the days that follow offer a last chance to bolster his lagging poll ratings, define his legacy, rebut negative narratives emerging from the campaign trail and challenge his would-be successors to address the issues he deems most vital.\nAides say Mr. Obama wants to present an upbeat, optimistic view of America after seven years that will contrast with the gloomy portrayals offered by Republican candidates, a task aided by strong job creation numbers but complicated by continuing turmoil in the Middle East and elsewhere.\nAt the same time, while Mr. Obama will introduce a few policy proposals, more broadly he hopes to generate support for his approach to issues like climate change, gun control, immigration and income inequality that can boost Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, even if it does not result in further action during his tenure.\n“Last year, he spoke to Congress,” said Jennifer Psaki, the White House communications director. “This year, he’ll be speaking more to the American public.”\nBut it is a public that does not share his sunny assessment of the state of the union. In a survey conducted by The New York Times and CBS News in December, 68 percent of Americans said the country was on the wrong track, the highest such figure in more than two years. Many in the poll were unimpressed with the president’s performance on critical issues like the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.\nThat sour public mood has challenged Mr. Obama throughout his presidency. Since he took office, the proportion of Americans who consider the country heading in the right direction in Times-CBS polls has never outnumbered those who think it is on the wrong track. That was true for most of his predecessor’s tenure, too.\nRepublican presidential candidates have tapped that sentiment. “The state of our union is a mess,” Donald J. Trump said Sunday on “Meet the Press” on NBC News. “We can’t beat ISIS. Our military is falling back. It’s not being properly taken care of. Our vets aren’t being properly taken care of. Obamacare, as you know, is going to fail very soon and probably in ’17, our health care — we don’t have borders. We don’t have anything.”\nSenator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, said “the whole Middle East is in terrible shape” under Mr. Obama. “So I’d like to see the president step up here in his last year and lay out a plan for the defeat of ISIL,” he said on “This Week” on ABC. “It’s a good starting place.”\nThat sort of talk has gotten under Mr. Obama’s skin and he wants to use the nation’s biggest platform to push back. As a preview, he sent his White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, to most of the Sunday talk shows to counter the Republicans, citing the 292,000 new jobs created in December and the 2.65 million in all of 2015.\nThe Republicans are “seeming to run down America,” Mr. McDonough said on NBC. “I don’t really get it. What I see is an America that’s surging.”\n“We feel very optimistic about the future,” he added. “That’s a big difference between us and what’s going on in this public debate right now and that’s what you’ll hear about on Tuesday night.”\nThe speech comes less than three weeks before the Iowa caucuses kick off the voting for his successor, and one unspoken goal for Mr. Obama is to set the table for Mrs. Clinton.\nAides said they did not directly coordinate the president’s speech with her campaign, but did not need to because they knew her positions on the issues.\nHis focus on gun control last week is one area where they are in sync, and Mr. Obama said he would be a one-issue voter this year, refusing to support candidates who oppose “common sense” measures.\nBut Mr. McDonough insisted Sunday that the president would not endorse in the Democratic primary regardless of Senator Bernie Sanders’s past support for immunity from liability for gun manufacturers and dealers, legislation he now supports revising.\nJeff Shesol, a White House speechwriter for President Bill Clinton, said a president in his eighth year no longer has the same commanding voice he once did. “He doesn’t get to pick the terms of the debate precisely; he gets to influence them broadly.”\n“That was something that was on our minds at this stage in the Clinton White House,” Mr. Shesol said. “We didn’t get to dictate the terms. But we did actually” help shape the debate.\nThe decision to not focus on a string of sweeping new proposals reflects the recognition that Mr. Obama has little chance of securing major legislation from a Republican Congress. Two areas both sides see as likeliest for agreement are an overhaul of the criminal justice system and approval of Mr. Obama’s Asian-Pacific free trade agreement.\nIt may also reflect the normal exhaustion of new ideas in the eighth year of an eventful presidency. The White House went through the usual policy development process in preparation for a more conventional State of the Union address, but after Mr. Obama saw the ideas laid out, none was so compelling that he wanted to make it the centerpiece of his last annual speech.\nAmong the ideas being discussed was a new “moon shot” to cure cancer, sought by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose son Beau died of brain cancer last year. Mr. Biden at one point hoped to include a major new initiative in the State of the Union, but it has taken time to sort through the options and create a plan, so while it will be referred to in the speech, the vice president will wait to make a major rollout in the next few weeks.\nWhite House officials said other ideas generated by the process would still be presented over the course of the year. But they said Mr. Obama decided to talk more broadly about the progress the country has made and the steps needed not just this year but for the next five to 10 years. Aides said he would talk about democracy and the importance of everyone participating.\nHe will follow up with a two-day trip to Nebraska and Louisiana, two Republican states where he will urge governors to expand Medicaid coverage as part of his health care program.\n“Regardless of what’s happening on the campaign trail, the president still has an impactful bully pulpit,” Ms. Psaki said. “What people have noticed over the last year despite their skepticism is that he’s been willing to raise issues that haven’t been in the public domain and they’ve made their way onto the campaign trail.”","[""Most people would agree that a president's State of the Union address is an opportunity to influence public debate and set the agenda.""]",1649,26,0.01649,0.00078,0.01727
"DENVER — Ken Ivory, a Republican state representative from Utah, has been roaming the West with an alluring pitch to cattle ranchers, farmers and conservatives upset with how Washington controls the wide-open public spaces out here: This land is your land, he says, and not the federal government’s.\nMr. Ivory, a business lawyer from suburban Salt Lake City, does not fit the profile of a sun-scoured sagebrush rebel. But he is part of a growing Republican-led movement pushing the federal government to hand over to the states millions of acres of Western public lands — as well as their rich stores of coal, timber and grazing grass.\n“It’s like having your hands on the lever of a modern-day Louisiana Purchase,” said Mr. Ivory, who founded the American Lands Council and until recently was its president. The Utah-based group is funded mostly by donations from county governments, but has received support from Americans for Prosperity, the group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers.\nThe idea, which would radically reshape the West, is one that resonates with the armed group of ranchers and antigovernment activists who seized control of a wildlife refuge in Oregon more than a week ago. Ammon Bundy, the crew’s leader and the scion of a Nevada ranching family steeped in disputes with the federal government, said he and his sympathizers had gone to Oregon to give the refuge back to local ranchers.\nMany conservatives — Mr. Ivory among them — criticized Mr. Bundy’s gun-toting tactics, but their grievances and goals are nearly identical. And the outcry has grown amid a dust storm of rural anger at President Obama’s efforts to tighten regulations on fracking, air quality, small streams and other environmental issues that put struggling Western counties at odds with conservation advocates.\nIn the past few years, lawmakers across the West have offered up dozens of bills and resolutions seeking to take over the federal lands inside their borders or to study how to do so. Some of the legislation has been aimed at Congress, to urge it to radically revise the laws that have shaped 550,000 square miles of national forests and terrain run by the federal Bureau of Land Management, stretching from the Great Plains to the Pacific.\nThe effort — derided by critics as a pipe dream that would put priceless landscapes on the auction block — has achieved little so far.\nUtah is the only state to pass a law demanding that Washington hand over federal land to the state. That transfer never happened, so now, Republicans on a state land commission are pressing for a $14 million lawsuit to claim 31.2 million federal acres of canyons, scrub desert and rolling mesas. The state’s attorney general, a Republican, has said he is studying the case and will make a decision about whether to move forward.\nColorado’s experience illustrates how the land-transfer discussion far exceeds any concrete results. Last year, a Republican state senator from the agricultural eastern plains sponsored a bill to create a Colorado Federal Land Management Commission, to study turning over federal lands to the state. The measure never made it out of the Republican-controlled State Senate.\nIn Congress, Republicans have supported moves to set up a land-transfer fund and create a “framework” to hand federal acres to the states.\nLast week, Representative Greg Walden, the Republican who represents the Oregon district where the Bundy takeover is playing out, stood up in Congress to deplore the tactics of the armed protesters, but sympathized with their frustration.\n“More than half of my district is under federal management, or lack thereof,” Mr. Walden said, expressing anger at the Bureau of Land Management. “They have come out with these proposals to close roads into the forests. They have ignored public input.”\nIn July 2014, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas proposed preventing the federal government from owning more than half of any state’s land. (Five states are more than half federal land, according to a Congressional Research Service report.) And Representative Cresent Hardy, Republican of Nevada, whose district includes a ranch run by Mr. Bundy’s father, introduced a measure that would block the government from buying any new land unless it could pass a balanced budget.\nBut land experts say the movement offers few details about what would happen the day after the federal government handed over all its land. How would states afford hundreds of rangers, officers and administrators to keep the land safe and comply with complicated federal laws on environmental policy and protecting endangered species? Would the land stay public, or be sold off to the highest bidder?\n“They conveniently avoid all the difficult questions,” said Martin Nie, the director for the Bolle Center for People and Forests at the University of Montana.\nIn its mission statement, the American Lands Council says its strategy for securing local control of public land in the West involves four tenets: education, negotiation, legislation and litigation.\nIn practice, local land disputes — fueled by deepening antagonism toward federal land agencies — now unfold like social-media passion plays. Last summer, armed groups intervened by providing security and standing guard at mines in Oregon and Montana that had received stop-work orders from the Bureau of Land Management. And in December, Phil Lyman, a commissioner in San Juan County, Utah, received a 10-day jail sentence after he led a protest ride on all-terrain vehicles through a federal area that had been closed to motorized use.\n“All I did was drive down a canyon road,” Mr. Lyman said. “It seems to be getting worse, and the federal agencies, they are expanding. Their restraints are being overstepped. It’s not the way this country was set up. It’s not the founders’ design.”\nNot surprisingly, environmental activists have opposed dismantling federal lands, but so have hunters and anglers who worry their elk-hunting grounds and trout streams would be sold to private hands and developed. Unlike the federal government, many states require that their land be used as profitably as possible.\nAbout an hour’s drive from the wildlife refuge where Mr. Bundy’s group is facing off with the government, Erin Maupin and her husband, Jeff, pay the government each summer to feed their cattle on 19,000 acres of federally owned land. She said that like many ranchers, they wanted to work with the government, but that layers of grazing restrictions and environmental rules were getting out of hand.\n“We want somebody to make sure we’re doing it right,” Ms. Maupin said. “But it’s got to the point where there’s no common sense in it.”\nThe resentments toward federal land managers feel sharpest in economically strapped rural counties from Arizona to Montana, where up to 90 percent of the lands are federally managed. People love the beauty that surrounds them, but seethe at policies that they say have whittled away logging and mining jobs, left national forests vulnerable to wildfires and blocked access to public land.\n“The land policies now are, basically, lock it up and throw away the key,” said Leland Pollock, a commissioner in Garfield County, Utah, a county roughly the size of Connecticut with pine forests and stunning red-rock spires. “It’s land with no use. The local economy’s really suffered as a result. Grazing has been reduced. We used to have a thriving timber industry — that’s all but gone.”","[""Many states require that their land be used as profitably as possible.""]",1613,15,0.01613,0.00045,0.016579999999999998
"‘We aren’t the kind of family that sends our daughters to work,’’ Mahmoud al-Haj Ali told me one evening this fall. He’d just returned to the family’s dingy second-floor apartment in Aurora, Ill., from the warehouse where he and his 19-year-old daughter, Sham, sorted boxes. At work, Mahmoud tried to keep her in sight. ‘‘I saw how tired she was,’’ he continued. ‘‘It’s more than she can take.’’ Sham’s English classes provided only a shaky foundation in the language, and she struggled to negotiate basic conversations. Mahmoud also spoke little English — we were sitting with an interpreter — but he could manage the essential. Mahmoud work tomorrow, Mahmoud no work tomorrow, he said in self-parody. But he, too, was tired. He rolled up his sweatpants to reveal a swollen leg. In Syria, Mahmoud, 57, who once owned a flourishing locksmith business in the Emirates, would have already retired.\n‘‘We didn’t expect it to be so expensive,’’ he said of life in Aurora, an industrial river town 41 miles from Chicago, where the al-Haj Alis arrived in March. ‘‘What can we do?’’ The federal government and the nine nongovernmental agencies that help to relocate refugees in the United States select cities like Aurora because housing and jobs are readily available and the cost of living is relatively low. The al-Haj Alis also receive help with the rent from a local organization, the Syrian Community Network. Still, it isn’t enough. Mahmoud and his wife, Azizeh, had been counting on their son Waseem, who is 27 and trained as a psychologist, to help support the family. His wife, Noorhan, and their two young sons were supposed to be in Aurora, too. But, at the last minute, something went wrong with their application to resettle in America. Now they were stuck in Jordan.\nMahmoud flipped through the spiral notebook in which he calculates monthly expenses: Internet, $52; garbage collection, $40; rent, $1,125; repayments on the United States government loan for the plane tickets from Amman to America, $172. Mahmoud went into his and Azizeh’s bedroom and found the bill for the family’s airfare: $6,130. ‘‘Since I used to own a business, I like to record everything,’’ he said.\nMost nights, Mahmoud works at the warehouse until 11 before returning home with Sham. The al-Haj Alis’ sons Ahmad and Mohamed arrive home around then, too, from six-hour after-school shifts at a local supermarket. Although they’re twins, the boys, 17, dress and act as if they weren’t. Mohamed, curls stiffened with gel, favors a tie. Ahmad, an artist, is often bed-headed and prefers sweatsuits. Every day he tucks a Syrian flag into his waistband before heading to West Aurora High School, despite the occasional trouble the flag invites. At the supermarket, he mans the cash register; he likes to interact with customers, in part to show off the Syrian identity to which he clings. Mohamed, who is shyer and speaks far less about Syria, prefers to herd the stray carts in the parking lot.\nNow, collapsed on the couch, the twins scrolled through homemade videos of Ahmad strolling around their new neighborhood in sunglasses and found footage showing the rubble of their hometown, 6,000 miles away. The al-Haj Ali family comes from Khirbet Ghazaleh, a town of 16,000. It is 15 miles from Daraa, where the revolution against Assad began, in 2011, after his security forces arrested and tortured a group of students for writing antigovernment slogans.\nThe al-Haj Ali twins were only 13 at the time. They had nothing to do with the protests. Nor did anyone else in the immediate family. Although they listened to news reports of the Assad government’s ferocious attacks on civilians, they saw little indication, at first, of the violence around them. There was the odd black helicopter in the sky. And once, when Waseem was taking Azizeh to driving school, they watched a group of protesters carrying olive branches stream out of Daraa. Only later did they realize these were people fleeing a massacre by Assad’s forces.\nThen the airstrikes began. Government security forces raided the family’s home dozens of times. Their cousins, who lived next door, were imprisoned and tortured. Still, the al-Haj Alis hung on; they adapted to living in a war zone, spending evenings in the dark. Then, one morning in August 2012, they learned from a television news report that Azizeh’s brother, a high-ranking official in Assad’s military, had defected overnight to Jordan. His family would most likely be punished, with death, in his stead. He hadn’t warned them. He couldn’t: His phone was bugged, and sending a message would only have further endangered them. The al-Haj Alis never slept at home again. Within days, they left Syria for Jordan by car. Azizeh feared they’d be unable to make it across the border and was even more terrified that the names of her family members would be on a blacklist and that they would be arrested. Mahmoud handed their keys to a neighbor whose house had been flattened by airstrikes. ‘‘If we’re not back by sunset,’’ he told her, ‘‘you can have our house.’’\nThe war scattered the al-Haj Alis across the globe. Mahmoud, his wife, the twins and Sham made it to Aurora after a 30-month stay in Amman, Jordan. Two elder daughters, Rasha and Ruba, are in the Netherlands. Rasha arrived with her husband two years ago, and this fall Ruba followed. She and her three boys fled first to Morocco, then to Spain by boat, making their way on foot to an asylum center in the Netherlands, sharing a single room with two other families. (Ruba would like to bring her sons to America, but now that they are in a safe country, there is little chance of resettlement in the United States.) A third daughter, Rana, recently gave birth in Egypt; her 1-month-old is officially stateless. Another, Fatimah, is in Jordan. Yet the child of greatest concern to the family is their adult son, Waseem.\nThe al-Haj Alis worry he may never make it to Aurora. The family had been in Illinois for eight months when ISIS attacked in Paris, killing 130 people. Early reports claimed that one of the terrorists made his way to Europe by posing as a Syrian refugee. European countries imposed new border restrictions, and 31 American governors, including the governor of Illinois, Bruce Rauner, called for a moratorium on Syrian refugees. In December, when a militant couple shot up a center for the disabled in San Bernardino, Calif., killing 14 and earning accolades from ISIS, the rhetoric grew more vociferous. A store clerk was shot in Michigan, a Somali restaurant was set ablaze in North Dakota and anti-Muslim hate crimes spiked around the United States.\nAzizeh wondered if she had brought her sons from Syria only to put them at risk in America, and if Waseem would ever join them now.\nThe al-Haj Alis are five of the 2,647 Syrian refugees who have been resettled in the United States, roughly 0.06 percent of the more than 4.5 million driven from the country since the uprising began in 2011. The scale of the crisis is such that of the 20 million refugees flooding the world today, one in four is Syrian. Although President Obama has committed to bringing at least 10,000 more Syrians to the United States by this October, that number is still a trickle compared with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s effort to resettle 25,000 in Canada; Chancellor Angela Merkel’s acceptance of nearly 93,000 in Germany last fall; and President François Hollande’s promise to bring 30,000 more Syrian refugees to France over the next two years. Why has the United States taken so few?\n‘‘It’s extremely difficult to get into the United States as a refugee — the odds of winning the Powerball are probably better,’’ says David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee, which helps place refugees from 40 countries in American cities. And Syrians are subject to an extra degree of vetting. Although all refugees are screened by the National Counterterrorism Center, the F.B.I., the Defense Department, the State Department and United States Customs and Border Protection, among other intelligence agencies, Syrians must complete what is known as the Enhanced Syrian Review. This is an added screening by caseworkers at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in Washington, which assesses each Syrian case and selects some for processing through the Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate office. This extra step was put in place because of the difficulty of assessing the allegiances of the various rebel groups in Syria’s continuing war — what Barbara Strack, chief of the Refugee Affairs Division at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, describes as ‘‘the myriad actors and dynamic nature of the conflict.’’\nUntil recently, Syria’s refugees were not a pressing domestic political concern. To many Americans, the war in Syria seemed remote, a problem for Syria’s neighbors. Of greater import were the 11 million immigrants who had entered the United States illegally. Then last summer, images of the Syrian toddler Alan Kurdi lying dead on the Turkish shore mobilized American sympathies in favor of refugees, and the Obama administration found itself faulted for admitting so few. Quietly, President Obama directed Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, to work with the State Department to find out why vetting for Syrian refugees required 18 to 24 months.\nMcDonough, known for urging Obama to be cautious in engaging militarily in Syria, took the issue of refugees personally. As a Catholic growing up in Stillwater, Minn., the 10th of 11 children, he worked with his church to help arriving Vietnamese refugees. Now, carrying a stack of charts and graphs, he met with refugee advocates and members of Congress to learn about the pitfalls and procedural bottlenecks within the resettlement program and to study potential means of bringing Syrians more quickly to the United States without compromising on security. In closed-door National Security Council meetings last year, he advised State Department officials to lift bureaucratic hurdles. As a result, the United States has opened up refugee-processing centers in new locations that refugees can actually reach, including one in Erbil, in northern Iraq. By streamlining the process of resettling Syrian refugees, the Obama administration also hoped to demonstrate support for its European allies. ‘‘It’s important to the president’s view to show our allies overseas, who are taking a considerable influx of Syrians, that we support them and we’re doing our part,’’ McDonough told me recently.\nParis threatened to change everything. The Syrian passport found near the body of one militant turned out to be a fake, but at least two of the attackers had exploited the refugee routes from the Middle East to Europe. Overnight, the global good will toward refugees that had been building all but vanished. Suddenly, the images of hundreds of thousands of refugees heading north inspired not empathy but alarm. According to the Soufan Group, a New York-based company that provides security-intelligence services, between 27,000 and 31,000 foreign fighters have gone to Iraq or Syria since the start of Syria’s civil war, the vast majority to fight alongside ISIS. At least 10 percent have headed back home. What once seemed like a trickle of vulnerable civilians now looked, to some, like a potentially dangerous flood.\nRepublican presidential candidates seized on the Syrian refugee issue as proof that Obama wasn’t keeping Americans safe. Dr. Ben Carson conflated Syrian refugees with ‘‘rabid dogs.’’ Jeb Bush called for deprioritizing Muslim refugees from the Middle East in favor of Christians. Senator Ted Cruz echoed this sentiment, proclaiming that Muslims should be sent to ‘‘Muslim-majority’’ countries while ‘‘Christians who are being targeted for genocide, for persecution, Christians who are being beheaded or crucified, we should be providing safe haven to them.’’ Donald Trump upped the ante by calling for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States.\nIn November, Republicans and some Democrats rallied behind House Bill 4038, the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, introduced by Representative Michael T. McCaul of Texas to slow the arrival of Syrian and Iraqi refugees in the United States. Days before the House vote, McDonough and Jeh Johnson, secretary of homeland security, briefed members of Congress on the Syrian-refugee-resettlement program and its screening process, in an attempt to reassure them that such a measure was unnecessary. The House nonetheless voted in favor of the bill, and as 2015 drew to a close, the Syrian refugee issue was at risk of becoming part of the year-end omnibus bill amid discussions of a government shutdown.\nIn the face of mounting political opposition, the president, in a choreographed Trudeau-esque gesture at the National Archives in Washington, welcomed 31 people from 25 countries at their citizenship ceremony. In private, McDonough rang up supporters and opponents alike. ‘‘Every phone call I’ve had with my friends on Capitol Hill, Republican and Democrat, and with governors around the country, I’ve underscored that we recognize the fear,’’ McDonough told me. He spoke of the need to ‘‘send a message’’ to ‘‘the Assad regime and to ISIL that the United States will continue to play the role that it has, that the world has become accustomed to it playing — mainly the role of alleviating suffering at the source and of being a refuge for the most vulnerable people.’’\nThe Syrian crisis is often described as a crisis of migration, but that’s not how it began. ‘‘This exodus didn’t come out of nowhere,’’ says Dr. Zaher Sahloul, senior adviser for the Syrian American Medical Society. The war in Syria has left some 250,000 people dead and displaced millions. And Syrian-American activists often refer to it as Obama’s Rwanda. ‘‘From Day 1 of the Syrian catastrophe,’’ says Bassam Barabandi, co-founder of the organization People Demand Change, ‘‘the U.S. started signing checks to the U.N., but they missed the point.’’ The point, he said, is ending the war, not creating a welfare state made up of refugees.\n‘‘It’s not a zero-sum choice,’’ Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. Blinken, who served as Obama’s national security adviser before returning to the State Department, where he began his career, has been asked by the White House to handle the thorny refugee issue. ‘‘We’re working 36 hours a day to solve the war in Syria,’’ he said, ‘‘but meanwhile, what do you do about the huge immediate challenge of more than four million people displaced from their country?’’\nFor millions of Syrians, Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan have become vast waiting rooms. ‘‘The two biggest drivers of onward migration are lack of access to education and lack of access to work,’’ Blinken told me recently, at the United States Embassy in Amman. The United States frequently trumpets the fact that of the countries donating to the United Nations in support of Syrian refugees, it gives the most aid, much of it going to front-line countries. But this is in part a self-serving strategy. The United States supports Syria’s neighbors so that they can withstand the pressures of millions of additional people. Refugees place a large burden on natural resources and social services. As a result, relations between Syrians and their hosts are souring. (Jordanians, groaning under the burden of 633,000 refugees, joke darkly that they live ‘‘between Iraq and a hard place.’’) Part of American strategy in the region has been to ease tensions between Syrians and their hosts. The United States provides services (schools and hospitals) for the refugees as well as for the citizens of host countries. They also allocate money for development to keep the host country happy. In Jordan, Blinken had just attended a falafel lunch with Jordanian venture capitalists who started a fund, with United States government support, to incubate technology start-ups.\nResettlement in the United States, however, remains a political challenge. ‘‘This is where ISIL neatly joins the problem,’’ Blinken said. ‘‘Very few of the refugees we admit are young males without families — we focus on women, children, the sick and those vulnerable to violence. But you now have this new concern that these refugee populations will somehow be infiltrated by terrorists.’’ In the aftermath of the Paris attacks, European countries hardened their stance on refugees, making illegal migration more difficult by closing borders. (For the first time in 50 years, for instance, those crossing between Denmark and Sweden have to show photo ID.) Turkey is under pressure to do the same. Recently, after receiving promises of $3.25 billion in aid from the E.U., Turkey reportedly arrested 1,300 asylum seekers trying to cross the sea to Greece.\nThe refugees already in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan are more likely to be stuck there, which means that a humanitarian crisis is becoming an economic-development problem. Syrians, many of whom lived sophisticated lives, are often unable to access even the most basic services. ‘‘These are people who had microwaves and cars, and now they’re in tin boxes in the desert,’’ says Jonathan Campbell of the World Food Program. The key factor in their migration is hopelessness. This past fall, the W.F.P. sent text messages to 230,000 Syrians living in Jordan to tell them that their food benefits were going to be substantially reduced because of lack of funding and donor fatigue. (They were later restored.) Although the United States made a large pledge, other countries, facing financial crises at home, did not. As a result, 64 percent of the refugees told the W.F.P. they were going to be forced to leave the country. One family out of every four took a child out of school to work. ‘‘It’s not a pull factor that makes them move, it’s a push factor,’’ says Myriam Baele, head of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees’ refugee-resettlement unit in Jordan. ‘‘If there isn’t a means to survive here, they will go,’’ she went on. ‘‘Either to Europe or back to Syria, where they will die.’’\nWaseem al-Haj Ali and his wife, Noorhan, keep two blue suitcases packed in the apartment they once shared with their family in Amman. ‘‘It’s a nightmare,’’ Waseem said on a recent evening. ‘‘There’s no future here in Jordan. I can’t even get a driver’s license.’’ In exasperation, he raised his eyebrows, bushy like his father’s. The apartment’s peeling walls were covered in blue and purple flowers, drawn by his brother Ahmad before he left for America.\nEarly last spring in Amman, when the al-Haj Alis were all still together, Waseem, Noorhan and their sons, who are 4 and 2, cleared the Enhanced Syrian Review and completed four days of cultural-orientation classes — which include everything from pictures of what to pack (warm clothing and money) and what not to (weapons and illegal drugs) to the importance Americans place on such concepts as punctuality and privacy. These courses are offered only to those who are in the process of resettling in the United States. Noorhan, who had been studying in Syria to become a teacher and whose dark eyes glitter with an easy intelligence, paid special attention to the weather. ‘‘Arizona is like the gulf,’’ she recalled learning. ‘‘Hot, dry and full of snakes.’’\nTen days before Waseem and his family were scheduled to leave, they had completed everything but their medical exams. Then they received a call from the Americans: They couldn’t go just yet. Something had come up in their security clearance, Waseem recalled being told. In retrospect, Waseem’s parents wonder if they should have waited for him. The plan had always been for Waseem to support the family: Azizeh had three ruptured disks and needed back surgery; Mahmoud had an old leg injury. But if the al-Haj Alis had delayed and lost their place in line, they might never have gotten to America. Waseem now feels guilty that he encouraged them to go ahead. He wasn’t sure his parents could make it without him. ‘‘I’m trying to be patient for my parents,’’ he said. ‘‘If it weren’t for them, I would’ve already left.’’\n‘‘If we don’t get a call from the Americans before smuggling season begins in the spring, we’ll leave for Europe,’’ he went on. The last thing he and his wife wanted to do was take two toddlers over the sea. Like everyone else, they had seen the photos of Alan on the beach. Their children couldn’t swim, and neither could Noorhan. But what choice did they have?\n‘‘We think only about traveling,’’ he said. ‘‘All we want is to go the United States.’’ Day after day, he checked the news on Facebook and chatted with his mother in Aurora. ‘‘We hope to live in a simple house, with a car outside, and just to watch our kids grow up,’’ Noorhan said. ‘‘That’s it. We don’t want a palace or some luxury life.’’\nWhen the rest of his family left in March, Waseem thought he would have to wait for about a month at the most. One month was now eight. As it grew colder, he stopped walking along the highway looking for illegal construction jobs. The market for day laborers was drying up. He didn’t dare ask for work in the strip of neon-lit shawarma stands downtown, even though many were staffed by fellow refugees. If he was caught working, Waseem could be imprisoned, transferred to the refugee camps, where only the poorest of the poor live, or sent back to Syria. Still, he had to find a way to pay the $247 rent on the apartment he once shared with his parents. He and Noorhan relied increasingly on whatever Mahmoud could send back from America. Instead of helping to support his parents, he was taking from them. ‘‘My father used to be a wealthy man,’’ Waseem said, recalling Mahmoud’s locksmith business in Abu Dhabi. Once the war began, Mahmoud sold the business for $120,000. For nearly five years, that money supported more than a dozen family members in five different countries. Now the money was gone.\nAmong Syrian refugees, ‘‘on hold’’ is the most dreaded category. It is extremely difficult to get clear answers about why the hold has been applied or when it will be lifted. To try to learn more, Waseem designated The New York Times as a third party with the legal right to inquire about his case. In response to an email from The Times in November, the International Organization for Migration would say only that Waseem’s case ‘‘is currently on hold pending further review by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.’’\nOfficials cannot comment on individual cases, but when briefed on the case as a hypothetical, immigration officers and resettlement experts offered several possible explanations: It could be as simple as an applicant’s security clearance having expired while a family member waited to be vetted. Or maybe Waseem’s name sounds like a name on a terrorist watch-list. Or maybe, at the very last minute, ‘‘recurrent vetting’’ raised a red flag. Recurrent vetting, which began in 2015, checks names through a series of databases right up to when the flight lands in the United States. As a senior intelligence officer with the National Counterterrorism Center described it: ‘‘If you have an 800 credit score and you’re good for a new Visa card, and two weeks from now they find out that, hey, two years ago, you changed your name to cover up a prior bankruptcy, then they can take away that card.’’\nOr maybe it was Azizeh’s brother. As a former military member of the Assad regime, he might still count as a black mark. Even though he defected early on, he could, by some bureaucratic oversight, still be designated a security risk to the United States. When reached in Qatar this fall, via Skype, he expressed relief that all of his family had made it out of Syria alive. He, too, was searching for a new country. ‘‘I’m not looking for beauty or history,’’ he said. ‘‘I’m looking for a country with human rights and freedom.’’ Other family members described specific questions regarding Azizeh’s brother posed to them by American immigration officers in Jordan. For example, did they serve him coffee or tea when he was in their homes? This was most likely a question to determine whether the family had provided material support — which could include a cup of coffee, a glass of water, a ride — to someone designated to be an enemy of the United States.\nAs months passed with no answers, Waseem turned over the strange questions he was asked during his final interview. Could these hold the key to the predicament in which he now found himself? Did he intend to commit terrorism in the United States? No. Did he intend to visit a prostitute in the United States? No. Refugees often refer to questions like the last one as ‘‘the crazy questions,’’ a senior immigration official told me: queries that, by law, immigration officials must ask to determine grounds of inadmissibility, even though they’re anachronistic. Others include Are you a member of the Nazi Party? and Are you a habitual drunkard?\nThe system of vetting refugees was first overhauled after Sept. 11. Since then, America’s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and conflicts in Africa and Asia have led to further refinements in how the United States evaluates refugees. Since 2007, for instance, the Defense Department has worked with the Homeland Security Department to share its intelligence on Iraqis, who represent one of the largest influxes of refugees to the United States in the last decade (more than 85,000 since 2008). Many won the right to apply for admission to the United States after risking their lives to aid American soldiers. Yet, as these Iraqis began to arrive, opposition to resettling them was swift. It began, for the most part, with fringe groups. Ann Corcoran, a conservative from rural Maryland, started a blog called Refugee Resettlement Watch, in which she chronicles news related to Muslims and others arriving in the United States. She warns that Muslims are coming to build ‘‘cities within cities’’ and to establish Shariah law in America. Corcoran told me that in Iowa last spring, she handed her book, ‘‘Refugee Resettlement and Hijra to America,’’ directly to Donald Trump.\nResettling refugees isn’t a perfect process. ‘‘No immigration program is completely without risk,’’ a senior intelligence officer says. Yet over more than a decade, the United States agencies involved in the program have learned to communicate more effectively. ‘‘We got a lot smarter and developed additional relationships with the intelligence community beginning with the large-scale Iraqi processing in 2007,’’ Strack, of U.S.C.I.S., says. She adds, ‘‘We are the opposite of stove-piped — we’re incredibly networked.’’\nOne common misconception about how a Syrian refugee comes to America is that she simply approaches the United States Embassy in Jordan or Turkey or wherever she first lands. This is not how resettlement works. To be legally designated a refugee, she must first apply to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. U.N.H.C.R. takes a photograph and scans her iris. Verification can take anywhere from a couple of months to a few years before she’s interviewed in person. Although these interviews aren’t considered security vetting, caseworkers are trained to eliminate those who may be lying, as well as those who have persecuted others or may be war criminals.\nIn addition to collecting biometric data like iris scans and photographs, U.N.H.C.R. case officers are trained in basic facial recognition and have 2-D screening capabilities to detect fake passports. The goal is to make sure people meet the criteria of the refugee convention, established after World War II. They’re also experts in country-of-origin information. ‘‘Listen, I know where your school is, I know the colors of its walls,’’ one U.N.H.C.R. officer says. ‘‘We detect lies based on what’s happened in the country of origin. It’s not just hour-by-hour events; it’s ethnicity, region, family. We know the custom — we know what their dresses look like.’’\nU.N.H.C.R. then advocates for the most vulnerable 10 percent; the other 90 percent will have to make a new life as best they can. Of the 20 million refugees worldwide, less than 1 percent will be officially resettled, and of those, the United States takes about half. Resettlement is only one of three options. The others are returning home (which, for most Syrians, is impossible) or remaining in the host country (which, given the pressures Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon are under, is becoming increasingly difficult). Those either barred or ‘‘deprioritized’’ include individuals with certain military ties, as well as families with missing members. This is to guard against the possibility that the missing member may be fighting alongside an anti-American group like ISIS and later try to rejoin his family.\nSyrians, like other refugees, don’t choose the country they end up in. U.N.H.C.R. selects the best option based on various criteria specified by host countries, like those from the most vulnerable groups or victims of torture. But there are limits to the requests countries can make. ‘‘We’re not a labor department,’’ a senior U.N.H.C.R. official said. ‘‘If countries come to us asking for a particular religion, we don’t encourage that.’’\nAll of this takes place before U.N.H.C.R. refers the case to any one country. Once U.N.H.C.R. provides a complete file to the United States, then the applicant’s entire family visits the State Department’s Resettlement Support Center for a prescreening interview. At this point, each individual is run through several databases, including ones at the Department of Homeland Security, the National Counterterrorism Center, the F.B.I. and the Department of Defense, and entered into the Worldwide Refugee Admissions Processing System, which warehouses the data and facilitates interagency screening checks. A pilot program will soon include iris scans, which are currently used by U.N.H.C.R. only for identification, not security purposes.\nThis fall, in several closed-door classified briefings before Congress and in public hearings, Anne C. Richard, the assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration, defended the rigorous vetting process. Of the more than 784,000 refugees who have been admitted to the United States in the last 14 years, five have been arrested on terrorism-related charges: One was an Uzbek man arrested in Idaho; the other four were refugees from Iraq. Such mistakes have provided fodder for those who worry that the country is exposing itself to needless risk. ‘‘ISIS has vowed to send its operatives into the West posing as refugees,’’ says McCaul, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. ‘‘The threat is real.’’ Advocates say that the threat of a refugee being a terrorist is statistically negligible. ‘‘We don’t leave holes, and we don’t take chances,’’ Richard told me. ‘‘If there’s any doubt about someone, they don’t come.’’ Indeed, as León Rodríguez, director of U.S.C.I.S., recently testified in Congress, the United States has barred 30 individuals from entering ‘‘based on their showing up in the databases.’’ (When queried, a senior intelligence official would say only that there were individuals of ‘‘national security concern.’’) Emily Gray, the executive director in Aurora of World Relief, a branch of the agency assigned by the United States government to help resettle the al-Haj Ali family, says, ‘‘You’d have to be a really stupid terrorist to come this way.’’\nAfter the U.S.C.I.S. officers in Washington conduct the enhanced review, the entire family is scheduled for another interview with a member of the Refugee Affairs Division, a team of 10 to 14 immigration officers from U.S.C.I.S. who spend six weeks on ‘‘circuit rides’’ — traveling up to four times a year to Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and other locations in the region, interviewing refugees being considered for resettlement in the United States.\n‘‘Just having an interview doesn’t sound so secure, but this is one heck of an interview,’’ Richard says. ‘‘First off, refugees are people fleeing tyrannical governments, so they may not trust people in positions of authority. They may be used to lying. They have to be prepared to have this interview, and if they’re caught lying, then they’re not going to make it, no matter how worthy.’’ At the end of this process, there are four possible outcomes: immediate acceptance, which is rare and can still involve waiting another 18 months, especially if there is a new marriage or birth; acceptance pending verification; denial; and the limbo into which Waseem al-Haj Ali and his family have now fallen, ‘‘on hold.’’\nFrom Jordan, one afternoon late this fall, Waseem called his mother in Chicago. ‘‘How are you?’’ he asked. He hadn’t anticipated her reply. She was fine, thank God, she said, but there was something wrong at the twins’ school. The night before, she received a call from the school saying there would be police there the next day and it was fine if the boys stayed home. She wasn’t sure what that meant or if other Syrians had received the same call. Azizeh sent the boys anyway. They survived airstrikes and house-to-house raids by Assad’s security forces; they could face American high school. ‘‘Oh,’’ Waseem said, and hung up. He and Noorhan were taken aback. What if, after all they had endured, his parents or Sham or the twins were hurt in America? Waseem was the one who was supposed to protect them, and all he could do was sit on the couch in Amman and accept handouts from his father.\n‘‘The worst thing is this game of waiting,’’ Issam Smeir, a psychologist in Aurora with World Relief who has counseled the al-Haj Alis, says. ‘‘It kills your soul.’’\nThe situation unfolding at West Aurora High wasn’t quite as Azizeh understood it. Ron Murphy, an assistant principal of operations at the high school, explained that yes, the Aurora police were called in as a precaution (Mohamed even snapped a selfie with an officer). But it had nothing to do with the boys. After a student tweeted his support for Trump and Trump’s stance on immigration, a Twitter war broke out. Even though there was no credible threat, the school took steps to reassure parents and defuse the situation. More than half of the school’s population is Hispanic.\nThe issue was immigration, not Islam, Murphy said. The school district models diversity remarkably; the twins were enrolled alongside Iraqis, Nepalis, Bangladeshis and immigrants from 57 countries in a curriculum for students learning English. Ahmad and Mohamed grumbled about it; these kids were uncool, and they only saw regular Americans during gym class.\nOutside school, the opposition to Syrian refugees wore on: In nearby Indiana, a Syrian family had to be rerouted to Connecticut because of the governor’s opposition. In an attempt to block the arrival of another Syrian family, Texas sued the International Rescue Committee, the resettlement agency working with that family, as well as the federal government.\nIn Congress, as the year drew to a close, House Bill 4038, which would have barred Syrian refugees, at least for a time, never came to the floor of the Senate, nor was it part of the omnibus — a pair of victories for McDonough and the White House. Instead, the mass shooting in San Bernardino refocused national security concerns on the visa-waiver program, which the administration had long seen as a problem, and through which one of the attackers had entered the country legally.\nIn January 2016, even as rising tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, key players in the war in Syria, imperiled upcoming cease-fire negotiations at the U.N. The Senate stood poised to consider new legislation that would halt the arrival of Syrian refugees. ‘‘We cannot stand by while jihadists try to exploit humanitarian programs to reach our shores undetected,’’ Michael McCaul, who sponsored 4038, said, citing serious screening gaps. Senator Mark Kirk, a Republican from Illinois, who recently introduced a similar bill in the Senate, also supports such legislation. ‘‘Reputable media outlets are uncovering examples of how terrorists infiltrate the Iraq and Syria refugee programs in an effort to commit acts of violence against the American people and our allies,’’ Kirk said. ‘‘Common sense requires thoughtful measures to keep Americans safe.’’\nOne winter afternoon, not long after the incident at the boys’ school, Azizeh nursed a cup of tea and talked bleakly of the family’s future. What if the governor had the power to keep Waseem out of Illinois? And if he couldn’t come, what would they do? Then there were the boys. ‘‘I’m worried someone will target them,’’ she said.\nShe also worried about herself and Sham. The long coats and hijabs they wore when they went out might attract the wrong kind of attention. Sham had come to America at the worst age possible. At 19, she wasn’t eligible to attend high school, and her English was too poor to pursue her dreams of becoming a lawyer. ‘‘That’s too expensive,’’ Sham said. ‘‘It would take too many years.’’\nTo secure a future for her, her parents had accepted the marriage proposal of an Iraqi used-car salesman named Layth Alali, Azizeh told me. Fifteen years older than Sham, Alali came to the country on a much-coveted Special Immigrant Visa in 2010, as part of the group of Iraqis who had worked with the United States military. (In Baghdad, he was the head of a checkpoint set up by the Americans.) The whole thing was rushed; he had asked just two weeks earlier, and the engagement ceremony was taking place immediately.\nAfter picking Sham and Azizeh up in a BMW S.U.V., Alali drove them to a prom-dress shop in Aurora, and they had less than an hour to find a dress. Sham picked out a spangled strapless confection, but Azizeh worried it exposed too much flesh. ‘‘Problem, problem, problem,’’ she said, pointing to her daughter’s bare neck, arms and shoulders. In the end, she snapped a picture and sent it via WhatsApp to her daughter-in-law, Noorhan, who was, as usual, sitting idle in the apartment in Jordan. A few seconds later, Noorhan sent back a smiley-face emoji with hearts for eyes. The dress, however flawed, was a yes.\nIn a life marked by disappointment and compromise, Azizeh remarked, what did the dress really matter? As a married woman, Sham would be more secure, and so would her family. At least, Azizeh said, Sham would no longer have to work in the office-supply warehouse.\nThe family had other concerns. The boys needed hundreds of dollars of dental work that Medicaid didn’t cover. The al-Haj Alis were struggling to make the rent, and winter was coming, which meant a new bill for heating. Azizeh was trying to figure out what kind of program might help pay the gas bill. As the temperature dropped and it grew dark at 4:30 in the afternoon, Ahmad and Mohamed seemed to be slowing down; Azizeh had to prod them off the couch to get them to work at the market.\nSchool was still a challenge. After nearly a year, neither spoke enough English to hold a conversation. Unlike their fellow refugees, who learned English by watching television and American movies, the boys preferred to spend their downtime watching Arabic-language news about Syria or YouTube videos from home.\nFor a long time, when they looked on Google Earth, they could see the debris of their family’s homes, which had been either burned or bombed. Now a mysterious white film obscured satellite images of the town. Was it a glitch, or a security measure on the part of the Assad regime to protect this strategic town, which now serves as a military base?\nIf Ahmad and Mohamed had stayed in Syria, they might be dead by now — either killed by the Assad government’s barrel bombs or fallen among the young men who have joined up with the Free Syrian Army. When one of their friends or cousins fighting with the F.S.A. is killed, the boys study the photographs of his death, often posted on Facebook in tribute, with a mixture of envy and guilt.\nIssam Smeir, the World Relief counselor, met with the al-Haj Ali family to help them handle the psychological stress of Waseem’s unexpected absence. He was watching for signs of depression in the boys. ‘‘Depression in kids doesn’t look like sadness,’’ Smeir said. ‘‘It looks like restlessness and anger.’’ The biggest argument that Ahmad has had at school involved fellow Syrians who support the Assad regime. The two sides got into a fight over which flag was the true Syrian flag — the one belonging to the Assad regime, or the revolutionary flag that Ahmad tucks into his waistband.\n‘‘Students ask about what Syria was like before the war,’’ Ahmad said at home after work one evening. ‘‘We say it was beautiful. It’s kind of baffling how people feel that the value of those who die in France is higher than those who die in countries like Iraq or Syria.’’ That day at school, during their first-period English class, their reading-comprehension portion involved a lesson about Cappadocia, Turkey, where people built an underground city to protect themselves during invasions. Afterward, the teacher handed out work sheets quizzing the kids on what they had learned. Why did people in Turkey live underground? The answer was B: to hide from their enemies. But Ahmad circled C: to live.\nThree days later, a text came in from Noorhan. More American politicians were opposing Syrians, and what she and Waseem had been reading on Facebook made them think the United States was shutting its borders tighter than ever. It looked as if they were going to have to take their boys over the sea. ‘‘After all the news,’’ she wrote, ‘‘we have no hope to travel to America.’’","[""It is common sense that learning a new language can be challenging.""]",9138,14,0.09138,0.00042,0.0918
